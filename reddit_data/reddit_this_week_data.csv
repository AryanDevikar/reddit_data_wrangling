1k7532r,ELI5: What makes music repeatable,"Compared to any form of entertainment, musical forms tend to be more repeatable. From longer classical pieces to pop music, nothing is ever a one time listen (at least for me). As you like the song more, you feel the need to listen to it again and again.

I have registered the work. And for films, it’s less abstract than the other mediums but even those I watch once and spend time to process or feel the emotions. After that it may have changed some aspect of my perspective of the world but I never get an urge to re watch immediately. 

Is there an equivalent to music for the other senses? I described how visually I don’t see such an effect.

1k5ma54,"ELI5: Gravity, potential energy, and conservation","Gravity is not a force, there is no 'gravitational field, it is a curvature of spacetime created by mass.  If an object is traveling through space and comes close enough to a sufficiently massive object that object will appear, from the perspective of the massive body, to curve and fall towards that body.  From the perspective of the object, however, it will never change course and it continues to travel a straight line....effectively the body appears to move until it is directly in front.  The object is, in fact, traveling a straight line through increasingly curved space.  

But then there is potential energy, which I recall from school is not actual energy but just...for lack of a better explanation...a measurement equal to the kinetic energy a falling object will gain as it falls toward the center of mass of a gravitationally attracting body.  

I tend to think of this this way- the gradient between the less curved space 'above' and the more curved space 'below' creates a kind of ""pressure"" (I know that term is not the best but it's what I've got) or tendency that moves objects towards the center of the strongest local gravity well.  I don't understand it any better than that. If that's wrong, feel free to correct it.   

Here is where I'm stuck.  

1- that pressure or tendency will physically accelerate the object relative to the attracting body at a constant acceleration up until something stops or slows it- the surface or an atmosphere.  Even if this acceleration is created without using energy, it seems to me that energy is gained.  The common answer is that potential energy is transformed into kinetic but if potential energy really isn't energy, how does this exchange take place and from what to what?  How does PE become KE?  

2- when an object comes to rest on the surface of the attracting body it will then exert, as a function of the potential energy between that object and the center of mass of the body, a real force, what we call ""weight"", that the attracting mass will counter with an equal and opposite force. You can measure it.  That force is real and can have a physical impact on other physical things.   But, and this is where my true confusion lies, the object will continue to weigh what it does effectively forever as long as it and the attracting mass exist.  That real, measurable downward force goes on in perpetuity.  That pressure or tendency is creating a real force that never lessens or dissipates.

1k8zei3,ELI5 - PC graphics and resolution,"I've been watching some videos on YouTube where they are running benchmarks on different games for different PCs and processors. What i can't get my head around is the interaction between the resolution and the graphics settings of the game, i.e set to low, medium, high or ultra.

For example, when running the Indiana Jones game on one pc at 4k resolution, medium settings, they got 45-55 FPS, and 4k on low settings they got 68 FPS.

I don't understand how something set to low graphics settings would look good at 4k resolution?

1k4hg9j,How does OAuth work: ELI5?,"So I was reading about OAuth to learn it and have created this explanation. It's basically a few of the best I have found merged together and rewritten in big parts. I have also added a _super short summary_ and a _code example_. Maybe it helps one of you :-)

# OAuth Explained

## The Basic Idea

Let’s say LinkedIn wants to let users import their Google contacts.

One obvious (but terrible) option would be to just ask users to enter their Gmail email and password directly into LinkedIn. But giving away your actual login credentials to another app is a huge security risk.

OAuth was designed to solve exactly this kind of problem.

Note: So OAuth solves an authorization problem! Not an authentication problem. See [here][ref1] for the difference.

## Super Short Summary

- User clicks “Import Google Contacts” on LinkedIn
- LinkedIn redirects user to Google’s OAuth consent page
- User logs in and approves access
- Google redirects back to LinkedIn with a one-time code
- LinkedIn uses that code to get an access token from Google
- LinkedIn uses the access token to call Google’s API and fetch contacts

## More Detailed Summary

Suppose LinkedIn wants to import a user’s contacts from their Google account.

1. LinkedIn sets up a Google API account and receives a client_id and a client_secret
   - So Google knows this client id is LinkedIn
2. A user visits LinkedIn and clicks ""Import Google Contacts""
3. LinkedIn redirects the user to Google’s authorization endpoint:
   https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?client_id=12345&redirect_uri=https://linkedin.com/oauth/callback&scope=contacts

- client_id is the before mentioned client id, so Google knows it's LinkedIn
- redirect_uri is very important. It's used in step 6
- in scope LinkedIn tells Google how much it wants to have access to, in this case the contacts of the user

4. The user will have to log in at Google
5. Google displays a consent screen: ""LinkedIn wants to access your Google contacts. Allow?"" The user clicks ""Allow""
6. Google generates a one-time authorization code and redirects to the URI we specified: redirect_uri. **It appends the one-time code as a URL parameter**.
   - So the URL could be https://linkedin.com/oauth/callback?code=one_time_code_xyz
7. Now, LinkedIn makes a server-to-server request (not a redirect) to Google’s token endpoint and receive an access token (and ideally a refresh token)
8. **Finished**. Now LinkedIn can use this access token to access the user’s Google contacts via Google’s API

---

**Question:**
_Why not just send the access token in step 6?_

**Answer:** To make sure that the requester is actually LinkedIn. So far, all requests to Google have come from the user’s browser, with only the client_id identifying LinkedIn. Since the client_id isn’t secret and could be guessed by an attacker, Google can’t know for sure that it's actually LinkedIn behind this. In the next step, LinkedIn proves its identity by including the client_secret in a server-to-server request.

## Security Note: Encryption

OAuth 2.0 does **not** handle encryption itself. It relies on HTTPS (SSL/TLS) to secure sensitive data like the client_secret and access tokens during transmission.

## Security Addendum: The state Parameter

The state parameter is critical to prevent cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. It’s a unique, random value generated by the third-party app (e.g., LinkedIn) and included in the authorization request. Google returns it unchanged in the callback. LinkedIn verifies the state matches the original to ensure the request came from the user, not an attacker.

## OAuth 1.0 vs OAuth 2.0 Addendum:

OAuth 1.0 required clients to cryptographically sign every request, which was more secure but also much more complicated. OAuth 2.0 made things simpler by relying on HTTPS to protect data in transit, and using bearer tokens instead of signed requests.

## Code Example: OAuth 2.0 Login Implementation

# OAuth Explained

## The Basic Idea

Let’s say LinkedIn wants to let users import their Google contacts.

One obvious (but terrible) option would be to just ask users to enter their Gmail email and password directly into LinkedIn. But giving away your actual login credentials to another app is a huge security risk.

OAuth was designed to solve exactly this kind of problem.

Note: So OAuth solves an authorization problem! Not an authentication problem. See [here][ref1] for the difference.

## Super Short Summary

- User clicks “Import Google Contacts” on LinkedIn
- LinkedIn redirects user to Google’s OAuth consent page
- User logs in and approves access
- Google redirects back to LinkedIn with a one-time code
- LinkedIn uses that code to get an access token from Google
- LinkedIn uses the access token to call Google’s API and fetch contacts

## More Detailed Summary

Suppose LinkedIn wants to import a user’s contacts from their Google account.

1. LinkedIn sets up a Google API account and receives a client_id and a client_secret
   - So Google knows this client id is LinkedIn
2. A user visits LinkedIn and clicks ""Import Google Contacts""
3. LinkedIn redirects the user to Google’s authorization endpoint:
   https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?client_id=12345&redirect_uri=https://linkedin.com/oauth/callback&scope=contacts

- client_id is the before mentioned client id, so Google knows it's LinkedIn
- redirect_uri is very important. It's used in step 6
- in scope LinkedIn tells Google how much it wants to have access to, in this case the contacts of the user

4. The user will have to log in at Google
5. Google displays a consent screen: ""LinkedIn wants to access your Google contacts. Allow?"" The user clicks ""Allow""
6. Google generates a one-time authorization code and redirects to the URI we specified: redirect_uri. **It appends the one-time code as a URL parameter**.
   - So the URL could be https://linkedin.com/oauth/callback?code=one_time_code_xyz
7. Now, LinkedIn makes a server-to-server request (not a redirect) to Google’s token endpoint and receive an access token (and ideally a refresh token)
8. **Finished**. Now LinkedIn can use this access token to access the user’s Google contacts via Google’s API

---

**Question:**
_Why not just send the access token in step 6?_

**Answer:** To make sure that the requester is actually LinkedIn. So far, all requests to Google have come from the user’s browser, with only the client_id identifying LinkedIn. Since the client_id isn’t secret and could be guessed by an attacker, Google can’t know for sure that it's actually LinkedIn behind this. In the next step, LinkedIn proves its identity by including the client_secret in a server-to-server request.

1k63ok7,How does OIDC work: ELI5?,"Similar to my last post, I was reading a lot about OIDC and created this explanation. It's a mix of the best resources I have found with some additions and a lot of rewriting. I have added a super short summary and a code example at the end. Maybe it helps one of you :-) This is the [repo][repo-ref].

# OIDC Explained

Let's say John is on LinkedIn and clicks _'Login with Google_'. He is now logged in without that LinkedIn knows his password or any other sensitive data. Great! But how did that work?

Via OpenID Connect (OIDC). This protocol builds on OAuth 2.0 and is the answer to above question.

I will provide a super short and simple summary, a more detailed one and even a code snippet. You should know what OAuth and JWTs are because OIDC builds on them. If you're not familiar with OAuth, see my other guide [here][ref_oauth_repo].

## Super Short Summary

- John clicks _'Login with Google_'
- Now the usual OAuth process takes place
  - John authorizes us to get data about his Google profile
    - E.g. his email, profile picture, name and user id
- **Important**: Now Google not only sends LinkedIn the access token as specified in OAuth, **but also a JWT.**
- LinkedIn uses the JWT for authentication in the usual way
  - E.g. John's browser saves the JWT in the cookies and sends it along every request he makes
  - LinkedIn receives the token, verifies it, and sees ""_ah, this is indeed John_""

## More Detailed Summary

Suppose LinkedIn wants users to log in with their Google account to authenticate and retrieve profile info (e.g., name, email).

1. LinkedIn sets up a Google API account and receives a client_id and a client_secret
   - So Google knows this client id is LinkedIn
2. John clicks '_Log in with Google_' on LinkedIn.
3. LinkedIn redirects to Google’s OIDC authorization endpoint:
   https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?client_id=...&redirect_uri=...&scope=openid%20profile%20email&response_type=code
   - As you see, LinkedIn passes client_id, redirect_id, scope and response_type as URL params
     - **Important:** scope must include openid
     - profile and email are optional but commonly used
   - redirect_uri is where Google sends the response.
4. John logs into Google
5. Google asks: '_LinkedIn wants to access your Google Account_', John clicks '_Allow_'
6. Google redirects to the specified redirect_uri with a one-time authorization code. For example:
   https://linkedin.com/oidc/callback?code=one_time_code_xyz
7. LinkedIn makes a server-to-server request to Google
   - It passes the one-time code, client_id, and client_secret in the request body
   - Google responds with an **access token and a JWT**
8. **Finished.** LinkedIn now uses the JWT for authentication and can use the access token to get more info about John's Google account

## Addendum

In step 8 LinkedIn also verifies the JWT's signature and claims. Usually in OIDC we use asymmetric encryption (Google does for example) to sign the JWT. The advantage of asymmetric encryption is that the JWT can be verified by anyone by using the public key, including LinkedIn.

Ideally, Google also returns a refresh token. The JWT will work as long as it's valid, for example hasn't expired. After that, the user will need to redo the above process.

The public keys are usually specified at the JSON Web Key Sets (JWKS) endpoint.

## Key Additions to OAuth 2.0

As we saw, OIDC extends OAuth 2.0. This guide is incomplete, so here are just a few of the additions that I consider key additions.

### ID Token

The ID token is the JWT. It contains user identity data (e.g., sub for user ID, name, email). It's signed by the IdP (Identity provider, in our case Google) and verified by the client (in our case LinkedIn). The JWT is used for authentication. Hence, while OAuth is for authorization, OIDC is authentication.

Don't confuse Access Token and ID Token:

- Access Token: Used to call Google APIs (e.g. to get more info about the user)
- ID Token: Used purely for authentication (so we know the user actually is John)

### Discovery Document

OIDC providers like Google publish a JSON configuration at a standard URL:

`https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration`

This lists endpoints (e.g., authorization, token, UserInfo, JWKS) and supported features (e.g., scopes). LinkedIn can fetch this dynamically to set up OIDC without hardcoding URLs.

### UserInfo Endpoint

OIDC standardizes a UserInfo endpoint (e.g., https://openidconnect.googleapis.com/v1/userinfo). LinkedIn can use the access token to fetch additional user data (e.g., name, picture), ensuring consistency across providers.

### Nonce

To prevent replay attacks, LinkedIn includes a random nonce in the authorization request. Google embeds it in the ID token, and LinkedIn checks it matches during verification.

### Security Notes

- HTTPS: OIDC requires HTTPS for secure token transmission.

- State Parameter: Inherited from OAuth 2.0, it prevents CSRF attacks.

- JWT Verification: LinkedIn must validate JWT claims (e.g., iss, aud, exp, nonce) to ensure security.

## Code Example

Below is a standalone Node.js example using Express to handle OIDC login with Google, storing user data in a SQLite database.

Please note that this is just example code and some things are missing or can be improved.

I also on purpose did not use the library openid-client so less things happen ""behind the scenes"" and the entire process is more visible. In production you would want to use openid-client or a similar library.

Last note, I also don't enforce HTTPS here, which in production you really really should.

It's a mix of the best resources I have found with some additions and a lot of rewriting. I have added a super short summary and a code example at the end. Maybe it helps one of you :-) This is the [repo][repo-ref].

# OIDC Explained

Let's say John is on LinkedIn and clicks _'Login with Google_'. He is now logged in without that LinkedIn knows his password or any other sensitive data. Great! But how did that work?

Via OpenID Connect (OIDC). This protocol builds on OAuth 2.0 and is the answer to above question.

I will provide a super short and simple summary, a more detailed one and even a code snippet. You should know what OAuth and JWTs are because OIDC builds on them. If you're not familiar with OAuth, see my other guide [here][ref_oauth_repo].

## Super Short Summary

- John clicks _'Login with Google_'
- Now the usual OAuth process takes place
  - John authorizes us to get data about his Google profile
    - E.g. his email, profile picture, name and user id
- **Important**: Now Google not only sends LinkedIn the access token as specified in OAuth, **but also a JWT.**
- LinkedIn uses the JWT for authentication in the usual way
  - E.g. John's browser saves the JWT in the cookies and sends it along every request he makes
  - LinkedIn receives the token, verifies it, and sees ""_ah, this is indeed John_""

## More Detailed Summary

Suppose LinkedIn wants users to log in with their Google account to authenticate and retrieve profile info (e.g., name, email).

1. LinkedIn sets up a Google API account and receives a client_id and a client_secret
   - So Google knows this client id is LinkedIn
2. John clicks '_Log in with Google_' on LinkedIn.
3. LinkedIn redirects to Google’s OIDC authorization endpoint:
   https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?client_id=...&redirect_uri=...&scope=openid%20profile%20email&response_type=code
   - As you see, LinkedIn passes client_id, redirect_id, scope and response_type as URL params
     - **Important:** scope must include openid
     - profile and email are optional but commonly used
   - redirect_uri is where Google sends the response.
4. John logs into Google
5. Google asks: '_LinkedIn wants to access your Google Account_', John clicks '_Allow_'
6. Google redirects to the specified redirect_uri with a one-time authorization code. For example:
   https://linkedin.com/oidc/callback?code=one_time_code_xyz
7. LinkedIn makes a server-to-server request to Google
   - It passes the one-time code, client_id, and client_secret in the request body
   - Google responds with an **access token and a JWT**
8. **Finished.** LinkedIn now uses the JWT for authentication and can use the access token to get more info about John's Google account

## Addendum

In step 8 LinkedIn also verifies the JWT's signature and claims. Usually in OIDC we use asymmetric encryption (Google does for example) to sign the JWT. The advantage of asymmetric encryption is that the JWT can be verified by anyone by using the public key, including LinkedIn.

Ideally, Google also returns a refresh token. The JWT will work as long as it's valid, for example hasn't expired. After that, the user will need to redo the above process.

The public keys are usually specified at the JSON Web Key Sets (JWKS) endpoint.

## Key Additions to OAuth 2.0

As we saw, OIDC extends OAuth 2.0. This guide is incomplete, so here are just a few of the additions that I consider key additions.

### ID Token

The ID token is the JWT. It contains user identity data (e.g., sub for user ID, name, email). It's signed by the IdP (Identity provider, in our case Google) and verified by the client (in our case LinkedIn). The JWT is used for authentication. Hence, while OAuth is for authorization, OIDC is authentication.

Don't confuse Access Token and ID Token:

- Access Token: Used to call Google APIs (e.g. to get more info about the user)
- ID Token: Used purely for authentication (so we know the user actually is John)

### Discovery Document

OIDC providers like Google publish a JSON configuration at a standard URL:

`https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration`

This lists endpoints (e.g., authorization, token, UserInfo, JWKS) and supported features (e.g., scopes). LinkedIn can fetch this dynamically to set up OIDC without hardcoding URLs.

### UserInfo Endpoint

OIDC standardizes a UserInfo endpoint (e.g., https://openidconnect.googleapis.com/v1/userinfo). LinkedIn can use the access token to fetch additional user data (e.g., name, picture), ensuring consistency across providers.

### Nonce

To prevent replay attacks, LinkedIn includes a random nonce in the authorization request. Google embeds it in the ID token, and LinkedIn checks it matches during verification.

### Security Notes

- HTTPS: OIDC requires HTTPS for secure token transmission.

- State Parameter: Inherited from OAuth 2.0, it prevents CSRF attacks.

- JWT Verification: LinkedIn must validate JWT claims (e.g., iss, aud, exp, nonce) to ensure security.

## Code Example

Below is a standalone Node.js example using Express to handle OIDC login with Google, storing user data in a SQLite database.

Please note that this is just example code and some things are missing or can be improved.

I also on purpose did not use the library openid-client so less things happen ""behind the scenes"" and the entire process is more visible. In production you would want to use openid-client or a similar library.

Last note, I also don't enforce HTTPS here, which in production you really really should.

1k511df,Expose local dev server with SSH tunnel and Docker,"


In development, we often need to share a preview of our current local project, whether to show progress, collaborate on debugging, or demo something for clients or in meetings. This is especially common in remote work settings.

There are tools like ngrok and localtunnel, but the limitations of their free plans can be annoying in the long run. So, I created my own setup with an SSH tunnel running in a Docker container, and added Traefik for HTTPS to avoid asking non-technical clients to tweak browser settings to allow insecure HTTP requests.

I documented the entire process in the form of a practical tutorial guide that explains the setup and configuration in detail. My Docker configuration is public and available for reuse, the containers can be started with just a few commands. You can find the links in the article.

1k7of6w,"[R][P] We compress any BF16 model to ~70% size during inference, while keeping the output LOSSLESS so that you can fit in more context or run larger models.","Glad to share another interesting piece of work from us: [**70% Size, 100% Accuracy: Lossless LLM Compression for Efficient GPU Inference via Dynamic-Length Float (DF11)**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11651)

The tl;dr of this work is super simple. We — and several prior works — noticed that while **BF16** is often promoted as a “more range, less precision” alternative to FP16 (especially to avoid value overflow/underflow during training), **its range part (exponent bits) ends up being pretty redundant once the model is trained.**

In other words, although BF16 as a data format can represent a wide range of numbers, most trained models' exponents are plenty sparse. In practice, the exponent bits carry around 2.6 bits of actual information on average — far from the full 8 bits they're assigned.

This opens the door for classic Huffman coding — where shorter bit sequences are assigned to more frequent values — to **compress the model weights** into a new data format we call **DFloat11/DF11**, resulting in a **LOSSLESS compression down to \~11 bits**.

# But isn’t this just Zip?

Not exactly. It is true that tools like Zip also leverage Huffman coding, but the tricky part here is **making it memory efficient during inference**, as end users are probably not gonna be too trilled if it just makes model checkpoint downloads a bit faster (in all fairness, smaller chekpoints means a lot when training at scale, but that's not a problem for everyday users).

What does matter to everyday users is **making the memory footprint smaller during GPU inference, which requires nontrivial efforts.** But we have figured it out, and we’ve open-sourced the code.

So now you can:

* Run models that previously didn’t fit into your GPU memory.
* Or run the same model with **larger batch sizes and/or longer sequences** (very handy for those lengthy ERPs, or so I have heard).

Some research promo posts try to surgercoat their weakness or tradeoff, thats not us. So here's are some honest FAQs:

# What’s the catch?

Like all compression work, there’s a cost to decompressing. And here are some efficiency reports.

* On an A100 with batch size 128, DF11 is **basically just as fast** as BF16 (1.02x difference, assuming both version fits in the GPUs with the same batch size). See Figure 9.
* It is up to **38.8x faster** than CPU offloading, so if you have a model that can't be run on your GPU in BF16, but can in DF11, there are plenty sweet performance gains over CPU offloading — one of the other popular way to run larger-than-capacity models. See Figure 3.
* With the model weight being compressed, you can use the saved real estate  for **larger batch size or longer context length**. This is expecially significant if the model is already tightly fitted in GPU. See Figure 4.
* What about **batch size 1 latency** when both versions (DF11 & BF16) can fit in a single GPU? This is where DF11 is the weakest — we observe **\~40% slower** (2k/100 tokens for in/out). So there is not much motivation in using DF11 if you are not trying to run larger model/bigger batch size/longer sequence length.

# Why not just (lossy) quantize to 8-bit?

**The short answer is you should totally do that if you are satisfied with the output lossy 8-bit quantization with respect to your task. But how do you really know it is always good?**

Many benchmark literature suggest that compressing a model (weight-only or otherwise) to 8-bit-ish is typically a safe operation, even though it's technically lossy. What we found, however, is that while this claim is often made in quantization papers, their benchmarks tend to focus on general tasks like MMLU and Commonsense Reasoning; which do not present a comprehensive picture of model capability.

More challenging benchmarks — such as those involving complex reasoning — and real-world user preferences often reveal noticeable differences. One good example is Chatbot Arena indicates the 8-bit (though it is W8A8 where DF11 is weight only, so it is not 100% apple-to-apple) and 16-bit Llama 3.1 405b tend to behave quite differently on some categories of tasks (e.g., Math and Coding).

Although the broader question: *“Which specific task, on which model, using which quantization technique, under what conditions, will lead to a noticeable drop compared to FP16/BF16?”* is likely to remain open-ended simply due to the sheer amount of potential combinations and definition of “noticable.” **It is fair to say that lossy quantization introduces complexities that some end-users would prefer to avoid, since it creates uncontrolled variables that must be empirically stress-tested for each deployment scenario.** DF11 offeres an alternative that avoids this concern 100%.

# What about finetuning?

Our method could potentially pair well with PEFT methods like LoRA, where the base weights are frozen. But since we compress block-wise, we can’t just apply it naively without breaking gradients. We're actively exploring this direction. If it works, if would potentially become a QLoRA alternative where you can lossly LoRA finetune a model with reduced memory footprint.

1k7pkvc,[R] Paper2Code: Automating Code Generation from Scientific Papers in Machine Learning,"**Paper:** [https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2504.17192](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2504.17192)

**Code:** [https://github.com/going-doer/Paper2Code](https://github.com/going-doer/Paper2Code)

**Abstract:**

>Despite the rapid growth of machine learning research, corresponding code implementations are often unavailable, making it slow and labor-intensive for researchers to reproduce results and build upon prior work. In the meantime, recent Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at understanding scientific documents and generating high-quality code. Inspired by this, we introduce PaperCoder, a multi-agent LLM framework that transforms machine learning papers into functional code repositories. PaperCoder operates in three stages: planning, where it constructs a high-level roadmap, designs the system architecture with diagrams, identifies file dependencies, and generates configuration files; analysis, which focuses on interpreting implementation-specific details; and generation, where modular, dependency-aware code is produced. Moreover, each phase is instantiated through a set of specialized agents designed to collaborate effectively across the pipeline. We then evaluate PaperCoder on generating code implementations from machine learning papers based on both model-based and human evaluations, specifically from the original paper authors, with author-released repositories as ground truth if available. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of PaperCoder in creating high-quality, faithful implementations. Furthermore, it consistently shows strengths in the recently released PaperBench benchmark, surpassing strong baselines by substantial margins. 

**Highlights:**

>PaperCoder demonstrates substantial improvements over baselines, generating more valid and faithful code bases that could meaningfully support human researchers in understanding and reproducing prior work. Specifically, 77% of the generated repositories by PaperCoder are rated as the best, and 85% of human judges report that the generated repositories are indeed helpful. Also, further analyses show that each component of PaperCoder (consisting of planning, analysis, and generation) contributes to the performance gains, but also that the generated code bases can be executed, sometimes with only minor modifications (averaging 0.48% of total code lines) in cases where execution errors occur.

>\[...\] Most modifications involve routine fixes such as updating deprecated OpenAI API calls to their latest versions or correcting simple type conversions.

>\[...\] The initially produced code may require subsequent debugging or refinement to ensure correctness and full functionality. In this work, comprehensive debugging strategies and detailed error-correction workflows remain beyond the current scope of this paper.

1k4zr1i,[R] [DeepMind] Welcome to the Era of Experience,">**Abstract**  
We stand on the threshold of a new era in artificial intelligence that promises to achieve an unprece dented level of ability. A new generation of agents will acquire superhuman capabilities by learning pre dominantly from experience. This note explores the key characteristics that will define this upcoming era.

>

>**The Era of Human Data**

>Artificial intelligence (AI) has made remarkable strides over recent years by training on massive amounts of human-generated data and fine-tuning with expert human examples and preferences. This approach is exem plified by large language models (LLMs) that have achieved a sweeping level of generality. A single LLM can now perform tasks spanning from writing poetry and solving physics problems to diagnosing medical issues and summarising legal documents. However, while imitating humans is enough to reproduce many human capabilities to a competent level, this approach in isolation has not and likely cannot achieve superhuman intelligence across many important topics and tasks. In key domains such as mathematics, coding, and science, the knowledge extracted from human data is rapidly approaching a limit. The majority of high-quality data sources- those that can actually improve a strong agent’s performance- have either already been, or soon will be consumed. The pace of progress driven solely by supervised learning from human data is demonstrably slowing, signalling the need for a new approach. Furthermore, valuable new insights, such as new theorems, technologies or scientific breakthroughs, lie beyond the current boundaries of human understanding and cannot be captured by existing human data.

>

>**The Era of Experience**  
To progress significantly further, a new source of data is required. This data must be generated in a way that continually improves as the agent becomes stronger; any static procedure for synthetically generating data will quickly become outstripped. This can be achieved by allowing agents to learn continually from their own experience, i.e., data that is generated by the agent interacting with its environment. AI is at the cusp of a new period in which experience will become the dominant medium of improvement and ultimately dwarf the scale of human data used in today’s systems.

1k5viph,[P] I built a self-hosted version of DataBricks for research,"Hey everyone,

I asked on here a little while back about self-hosted Databricks alternatives. I couldn't find anything that really did what I was looking for...

To cut to the chase, I figured that since a lot of this stuff is open source, I'd have a crack at centralising some of these key technologies into one research stack and interface. So, that's what I did. Please let me know what you think.

The platform is called Boson. https://github.com/bosonstack/boson

Here's a copy and paste list of some of its features. Ignore the market-y tone.

🔑 **Key Features**

**Out-of-the-Box Data Lake Integration** Boson uses Delta Lake to store datasets and features, making it easy to save and load dataframes as versioned tables. A built-in Delta Explorer lets you visually inspect your lake in real time.

**Lazy Data Processing with Polars** Boson supports efficient, memory-conscious data workflows using Polars. This makes large, expensive transformations performant and scalable—even on local hardware.

**Integrated Experiment Tracking** Powered by Aim Boson offers a seamless tracking experience—log metrics, compare experiments, and visualize performance over time with zero setup.

**Cloud-Like Notebook Development** All data, notebooks, artifacts, and metrics are stored in internal cloud storage. This keeps your local environment clean and every workspace fully self-contained.

**Composable, Declarative Infrastructure** Built on layered Docker Compose files, Boson enables isolated, customizable workspaces per project—without sacrificing reproducibility or maintainability.

**Currently only works on AMD64.** If anyone wants to help port it to ARM I'd be very thankful lol.

If this post is inappropriate for the sub then please feel free to take it down - I've genuinely found this tool useful for my own workflows and would be stoked if even just one other person found it helpful.",1745402995.0,35,5,/r/MachineLearning/comments/1k5viph/p_i_built_a_selfhosted_version_of_databricks_for/,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1k5viph/p_i_built_a_selfhosted_version_of_databricks_for/,Distinct-Gas-1049,MachineLearning,1.0,True,False,False,False,0,1745833464.015249,Tech & Programming,10,285,292,Wednesday,6,April,2025,False,0.98,0.122,0.031,0.848,positive,[P] I built a self-hosted version of DataBricks for research,"Hey everyone,

1k63r4a,[D] Is my take on transformers in time series reasonable / where is it wrong?,"Hi everyone!

For a bit of context, I'm giving some lectures in time series to an engineering class and the first course I just introduced the main concepts in time series (stationarity, ergodicity, autocorrelations, seasonality/cyclicity and a small window on its study through frequency analysis).

I wanted this course to invite students to think throughout the course about various topics and one of the open questions I asked them was to think whether natural language data can be considered non-stationary and if it is the case, why transformers do so well on it but not in other fields where data is non-stationary time series.

I gave them other lectures about different deep learning models, I tried to talk about inductive biases, the role of the architecture etc. And now comes the final lecture about transformers and I'd like to tackle that question I gave them.

And here's my take, I'd love it if you can confirm if some parts of it are correct, and correct the parts that are wrong, and maybe add some details that I might have missed.

This is not a post to say that actual foundational models in time series are good. I do not think that is the case, we have tried many time at work, whether using them out of the shelf, fine-tuning them, training our own smaller ""foundational"" models it never worked. They always got beaten by simpler methods, sometimes even naive methods. And many times just working on the data, reformulating the problem, adding some features or maybe understanding that it is this other data that we should care about etc., led to better results.

My ""worst"" experience with time series is not being able to beat my AR(2) model on a dataset we had for predicting when EV stations will break down. The dataset was sampled from a bunch of EV stations around the city, every hour or so if I remember correctly. There was a lot of messy and incoherent data though, sometimes sampled at irregular time intervals etc. And no matter what I did and tried, I couldn't beat it.

I just want to give a reasonable answer to my students. And I think the question is very complex and it is very much related to the field of question, its practices and the nature of its data, as much as of the transformer architecture itself. I do not claim I am an expert in time series or an expert in transformers. I'm not a researcher. I do not claim this is the truth or what I say is a fact. This is why I'd like you to criticize as much as possible whatever I think. This would be helpful to me to improve and will also be helpful to me students. Thank you.

I think we can all agree, to some extent at least, that transformers have the ability to learn very an AR function, or whatever ""traditional"" / ""naive"" method. At least in theory. Well it's hard to prove I think, we have to prove that our data lives in a compact space (correct me if I'm wrong please) but we can just agree upon it.  But in practice we don't notice that. I think it's mainly due to the architecture. Again, I might be wrong, but in general in machine learning it's better to use these types of architectures with low constraining inductive biases (like transformers) when you have very large datasets, huge compute power and scaling capability and let the model learn everything by itself. Otherwise, it's better to use some architecture with stronger inductive biases. It's like injecting some kind of prelearned knowledge about the dataset or the task to bridge that gap of scale. I might be wrong and again I'd love to be corrected on this take. And I think we don't always have that for time series data, *or*, we have it but are not using it properly. And by the way if you allow me this mini-rant within this overly huge thread, I think a lot of foundational model papers are dishonest. I don't want to mention specific ones because I do not want any drama here, but many papers inflate their perceived performance, in general through misleading data practices. If you are interested about this we can talk about it in private and I can refer you to some of those papers and why I think it is the case. 

So I think the issue is multi-faceted, like it is always the case in science, and most probably I'm not covering anything. But I think it's reasonable to start with: 1/ the field and its data, 2/ how we formulate the forecasting task (window, loss function), 3/ data itself when everything else is good.

Some fields like finance are just extremely hard to predict. I don't want to venture into unknown waters, I have never worked in finance, but from what a quant friend of mine explained to me, is that, if you agree with the efficient market hypothesis, predicting the stock price is almost impossible to achieve and that most gains come from predicting volatility instead. To be honest, I don't really understand what he told me but from what I gather is that the prediction task itself is hard, and that is independent of the model. Like some kind of Bayes limit. Maybe it'd be better to focus on volatility instead in the research papers. 

The other thing that I think might cause issues is the forecast window. I wouldn't trust the weather forecast in 6 months. Maybe its a model issue, but I think the problem is inherent to non-stationary data. 

Why do transformers work so well on natural language data then? I think its due to many things, two of them would be large scale data and having correlations repeated through it. If you take a novel from the 19th century from a British author, I think it'd be hard to learn a ""good"" model of what that language is, but having many different authors gives you a set of data that *probably* contain enough repeating correlations, though each author is unique, there are *probably* some kind of common or basis of language mastery, for the model to be able to learn a ""good enough"" model. This is without taking into account the redundant data, code for example. Asking an LLM to sort a list in place in Python will always result in the same *correct* answer because it is repeated through the training set. The other thing would be our metric of what a good model is or our expectation of what a good model is. A weather forecasting model is measured by the difference of its output with respect to the actual measurements. But if I ask a language model how to sort a list in Python, whether it gives me directly the answer or it talks a little bit before doesn't change much my judgment of the model. The loss functions during training are different as well, and some might argue its easier to fit cross-entropy for the NLP task than fitting some regression functions on some time series data.

That's why I think transformers in most cases of time series do not work well and we're better off with traditional approaches. And maybe this whole thread gives an idea of when we can apply time series (in a field where we can predict well, like weather forecasting, using shorter horizons, and using very large scale data). Maybe to extend the data we can include context from other data sources as well but I don't have enough experience with that to talk about it.

Sorry for this very huge thread, and if you happen to read it I'd like to thank you and I'd love to hear what you think about this :)

1k6oxvq,[R][P] Byte-level LLaMA and Gemma via cross-tokenizer distillation (with open-source toolkit),"Hello r/MachineLearning !

I’ve been experimenting with a method called ALM to distill language models *across tokenizers.* This enables, for example, transferring LLMs to a new tokenizer and distilling knowledge from a model with one tokenizer into a model with a different tokenizer (see [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20083) for details).

I’ve released [tokenkit](https://github.com/bminixhofer/tokenkit), a library implementing ALM among other methods, to make this easy to use.

One neat application of ALM is distilling subword-based LLMs into byte-level models. I've applied this to two instruction-tuned models:

* Gemma2-2B-IT-Byte: [https://huggingface.co/benjamin/Gemma2-2B-IT-Byte](https://huggingface.co/benjamin/Gemma2-2B-IT-Byte)
* Llama3-2-3B-IT-Byte: [https://huggingface.co/benjamin/Llama3-2-3B-IT-Byte](https://huggingface.co/benjamin/Llama3-2-3B-IT-Byte)

Even though the distillation phase is very short (just 1.2B bytes ≈ 330M subword tokens), the models perform competitively (for example **57.0% MMLU of the byte-level Llama** vs. 62.4% MMLU of the original Llama3-3B-Instruct).

This approach opens up an interesting direction: we can potentially keep subword tokenization for pretraining (to still squeeze as much text into the model in as little time as possible), but then change to a more user-friendly tokenization afterwards.

These models aren’t yet optimized for efficiency, but if you would add [self-speculative decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08168) plus a [BLT/DTP-style hierarchical architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09761) and/or [linearized attention](https://openreview.net/forum?id=G-uNfHKrj46), they might also be able to replace subword-based models when speed matters.

If you want to train your own models, [this guide on tokenizer transfer via tokenkit](https://github.com/bminixhofer/tokenkit/blob/main/docs/tokenizer_transfer.md) should make it easy. The model cards of the transfers above also contain the exact command used to train them. I’ve been training on fairly limited hardware, so effective transfer is possible even in a (near) consumer-grade setup.

I'd love to get feedback on the method, the models, or tokenkit itself.

1k4cqb4,[D] Combine XGBoost & GNNs - but how?,"There seems to be some research interest in the topic in the title, especially in fraud detection. My question is how would you cleverly combine them? I found some articles and paper which basically took the learned embeddings from GNNs, GraphSAGE etc. and stacked them to the original tabular data. Then run XGBoost on top of that.

On the one hand it seems logical that if you have some informations which you can exploit in graph structures (like fraud rings). There must be some value for XGBoost in those embeddings, that you cannot simply get from the original tabular data.

But on the other hand I guess it hugely depends on how well you set up the graph. Furthermore XGBoost often performs quite well in combination with SMOTE, even for hard tasks like fraud detection. So I assume your graph embeddings must really contribute something significant. Otherwise you will just add noise to XGBoost and probably even slightly deteriorate its performance.

1k910g9,[R] 62.3% Validation Accuracy on Sequential CIFAR-10 (3072 length) With Custom RNN Architecture – Is it Worth Attention?,"I'm currently working on my own RNN architecture and testing it on various tasks. One of them involved CIFAR-10, which was flattened into a sequence of 3072 steps, where each channel of each pixel was passed as input at every step.

My architecture achieved a validation accuracy of 62.3% on the 9th epoch with approximately 400k parameters. I should emphasize that this is a pure RNN with only a few gates and no attention mechanisms.

I should clarify that the main goal of this specific task is not to get as high accuracy as you can, but to demonstrate that model can process long-range dependencies. Mine does it with very simple techniques and I'm trying to compare it to other RNNs to understand if ""memory"" of my network is good in a long term.

Are these results achievable with other RNNs? I tried training a GRU on this task, but it got stuck around 35% accuracy and didn't improve further.

Here are some sequential CIFAR-10 accuracy measurements for RNNs that I found:

\- [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.09890](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.09890) (page 7, Table 2)  
\- [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12070](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12070) (page 19, Table 5)  
\- [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00144](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00144) (page 5, Table 2)

But in these papers, CIFAR-10 was flattened by pixels, not channels, so the sequences had a shape of \[1024, 3\], not \[3072, 1\].

However, [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.00396](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.00396) (page 29, Table 12) mentions that HiPPO-RNN achieves 61.1% accuracy, but I couldn't find any additional information about it – so it's unclear whether it was tested with a sequence length of 3072 or 1024.

So, is this something worth further attention?

I recently published a basic version of my architecture on GitHub, so feel free to take a look or test it yourself:

\- [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12070](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12070) (page 19, Table 5)  
\- [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00144](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00144) (page 5, Table 2)

But in these papers, CIFAR-10 was flattened by pixels, not channels, so the sequences had a shape of \[1024, 3\], not \[3072, 1\].

However, [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.00396](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.00396) (page 29, Table 12) mentions that HiPPO-RNN achieves 61.1% accuracy, but I couldn't find any additional information about it – so it's unclear whether it was tested with a sequence length of 3072 or 1024.

So, is this something worth further attention?

I recently published a basic version of my architecture on GitHub, so feel free to take a look or test it yourself:  
[https://github.com/vladefined/cxmy](https://github.com/vladefined/cxmy)

1k6xnvr,[D]Designing a vector dataset for hierarchical semantic search,"Hi everyone,

I’m working on designing a semantic database to perform hierarchical search for classifying goods based on the 6-digit [TARIC code](https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/dds2/taric/taric_consultation.jsp?Lang=en&Expand=true&SimDate=20250328#) (or more digits in the HS code system). For those unfamiliar, TARIC/HS codes are international systems for classifying traded products. They are organized hierarchically:

* The top levels (chapters) are broad (e.g., “Chapter 73: Articles of iron or steel”),
* While the leaf nodes get very specific (e.g., “73089059: Structures and parts of structures, of iron or steel, n.e.s. (including parts of towers, lattice masts, etc.)—Other”).

**The challenge:**  
I want to use semantic search to suggest the most appropriate code for a given product description. However, I’ve noticed some issues:

* The most semantically similar term at the leaf node is not always the right match, especially since “other” categories appear frequently at the bottom of the hierarchy.
* On the other hand, chapter or section descriptions are too vague to be helpful for specific matches.

**Example:**  
Let’s say I have a product description: “Solar Mounting system Stainless Steel Bracket Accessories.”

* If I run a semantic search, it might match closely with a leaf node like “Other articles of iron or steel,” but this isn’t specific enough and may not be legally correct.
* If I match higher up in the hierarchy, the chapter (“Articles of iron or steel”) is too broad and doesn’t help me find the exact code.

**My question:**

* How would you approach designing a semantic database or vectorstore that can balance between matching at the right level of granularity (not too broad, not “other” by default) for hierarchical taxonomies like TARIC/HS codes?
* What strategies or model architectures would you suggest for semantic matching in a multi-level hierarchy where “other” or “miscellaneous” terms can be misleading?
* Are there good practices for structuring embeddings or search strategies to account for these hierarchical and ambiguous cases?

I’d appreciate any detailed suggestions or resources.

1k6ra2p,[Discussion] Is the future of coding agents self-learning LLMs using KGs to shape their reward functions?,"Current coding agents (Copilot, etc.) are smart context-fetchers, but they don't really learn on our specific codebases. E.g., they always act like junior devs

But what if they did?

Imagine an LLM agent using Reinforcement Learning (RL). It tries tasks, gets feedback (tests pass/fail, etc.), and improves.

**The hard part? Rewarding ""good"" code.**

This is where Knowledge Graphs (KGs) could play a fascinating role, specifically in shaping the RL reward signal. Instead of just using KGs to retrieve context before generation, what if we use them after to evaluate the output?

* Example: The KG contains project standards, known anti-patterns, desired architectural principles, or even common bug categories specific to the codebase.

* Reward Shaping: The agent gets:
   * Positive Reward: If its generated code passes tests AND adheres to architectural patterns defined in the KG.
   * Negative Reward: If its code introduces anti-patterns listed in the KG, violates dependency rules, or uses deprecated functions documented there.

Basically, the agent learns to write code that not only works but also fits a project's specific rules and best practices.

**Is this the path forward?**

* Is KG-driven reward the key to truly adaptive coding agents?
* Is it worth the massive complexity (KG building, RL tuning)?
* Better ways to achieve self-learning in code? What's most practical?

Repeat Call Prediction for Telecom

Hey, I'm working as a Data analyst for a telco in the digital and calls space. 

Pitched an idea for repeat call prediction to size expected call centre costs - if a customer called on day t, can we predict if they'll call on day t+1? 

After a few iterations, I've narrowed down to looking at customers with a standalone product holding (to eliminate noise) in the onboarding phase of their journey (we know that these customers drive repeat calls).

Being in service analytics, the data we have is more structural - think product holdings, demographics. On the granular side, we have digital activity logs, and I'm bringing in friction points like time since last call and call history.

Is there a better way to approach this problem? What should I engineer into the feature store? What models are worth exploring?",1745603920.0,3,5,/r/MachineLearning/comments/1k7rff9/d_p_repeat_call_prediction_for_telecom/,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1k7rff9/d_p_repeat_call_prediction_for_telecom/,Glittering_Tiger8996,MachineLearning,0.8,True,False,False,False,0,1745833468.014998,Tech & Programming,7,167,172,Friday,13,April,2025,False,0.743,0.075,0.032,0.893,positive,[D] [P] Repeat Call Prediction for Telecom,"Hey, I'd like insight on how to approach a prediction themed problem for a telco I work at.

1k8lbro,[D] [P] Research Paper and Presentation about Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning,"Hey everyone!

I am a current Master's student, and I am working on a presentation (and later research paper) about MARL. Specifically focusing on MARL for competitive Game AI. This presentation will be 20-25 minutes long, and it is for my machine learning class, where we have to present a topic not covered in the course. In my course, we went over and did an in-depth project about single-agent RL, particularly looking at algorithms such as Q-learning, DQN, and Policy Gradient methods. So my class is pretty well-versed in this area. I would very much appreciate any help and tips on what to go over in this presentation. I am feeling a little overwhelmed by how large and broad this area of RL is, and I need to capture the essence of it in this presentation.

Here is what I am thinking for the general outline. **Please share your thoughts on these particular topics, if they are necessary to include, what are must cover topics, and maybe which ones can be omitted or briefly mentioned?**

*My current MARL Presentation outline:*

**Introduction**

* What is MARL (brief)
* Motivation and Applications of MARL

**Theoretical Foundations**

* Go over game models (spend most time on 3 and 4):
   1. Normal-Form Games
   2. Repeated Normal-Form Games
   3. Stochastic Games
   4. Partial Observable Stochastic Games (POSG)
      * Observation function
      * Belief States
      * Modelling Communication (touch on implicit vs. explicit communication)

**Solution Concepts**

* Joint Policy and Expected Return
   * History-Based and Recursive-Based
* Equilibrium Solution Concepts
   * Go over what is best response
      1. Minimax
      2. Nash equilibrium
      3. Epsilon Nash equilibrium
      4. Correlated equilibrium
* Additional Solution Criteria
   1. Pareto Optimality
   2. Social Welfare and Fairness
   3. No Regret

**Learning Framework for MARL**

* Go over MARL learning process (central and independent learning)
* Convergence

**MARL Challenges**

* Non-stationarity
* Equilibrium selection
* multi-agent credit assignment
* scaling to many agents

**Algorithms**

1. Go over a cooperative algorithm (not sure which one to choose? QMIX, VDN, etc.)
2. Go over a competitive algorithm (MADDPG, LOLA?)

**Case Study**

Go over real-life examples of MARL being used in video games (maybe I should merge this with the algorithms section?)

* AlphaStar for StarCraft2 - competitive
* OpenAI Five for Dota2 - cooperative

**Recent Advances**

End with going over some new research being done in the field.

Are frameworks like vLLM or TGI handling this well? Or are people still seeing meaningful infra costs or complexity from spinning up and down models dynamically?

1k9fhm8,[D] A reactive computation library for Python that might be helpful for data science workflows - thoughts from experts?,"Hey!

I recently built a Python library called [reaktiv](https://github.com/buiapp/reaktiv) that implements reactive computation graphs with automatic dependency tracking. I come from IoT and web dev (worked with Angular), so I'm definitely not an expert in data science workflows.

This is my first attempt at creating something that might be useful outside my specific domain, and I'm genuinely not sure if it solves real problems for folks in your field. I'd love some honest feedback - even if that's ""this doesn't solve any problem I actually have.""

The library creates a computation graph that:

* Only recalculates values when dependencies actually change
* Automatically detects dependencies at runtime
* Caches computed values until invalidated
* Handles asynchronous operations (built for asyncio)

While it seems useful to me, I might be missing the mark completely for actual data science work. If you have a moment, I'd appreciate your perspective.

Here's a simple example with pandas and numpy that might resonate better with data science folks:

    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    from reaktiv import signal, computed, effect
    
    # Base data as signals
    df = signal(pd.DataFrame({
        'temp': [20.1, 21.3, 19.8, 22.5, 23.1],
        'humidity': [45, 47, 44, 50, 52],
        'pressure': [1012, 1010, 1013, 1015, 1014]
    }))
    features = signal(['temp', 'humidity'])  # which features to use
    scaler_type = signal('standard')  # could be 'standard', 'minmax', etc.
    
    # Computed values automatically track dependencies
    selected_features = computed(lambda: df()[features()])
    
    # Data preprocessing that updates when data OR preprocessing params change
    def preprocess_data():
        data = selected_features()
        scaling = scaler_type()
        
        if scaling == 'standard':
            # Using numpy for calculations
            return (data - np.mean(data, axis=0)) / np.std(data, axis=0)
        elif scaling == 'minmax':
            return (data - np.min(data, axis=0)) / (np.max(data, axis=0) - np.min(data, axis=0))
        else:
            return data
    
    normalized_data = computed(preprocess_data)
    
    # Summary statistics recalculated only when data changes
    stats = computed(lambda: {
        'mean': pd.Series(np.mean(normalized_data(), axis=0), index=normalized_data().columns).to_dict(),
        'median': pd.Series(np.median(normalized_data(), axis=0), index=normalized_data().columns).to_dict(),
        'std': pd.Series(np.std(normalized_data(), axis=0), index=normalized_data().columns).to_dict(),
        'shape': normalized_data().shape
    })
    
    # Effect to update visualization or logging when data changes
    def update_viz_or_log():
        current_stats = stats()
        print(f""Data shape: {current_stats['shape']}"")
        print(f""Normalized using: {scaler_type()}"")
        print(f""Features: {features()}"")
        print(f""Mean values: {current_stats['mean']}"")
    
    viz_updater = effect(update_viz_or_log)  # Runs initially
    
    # When we add new data, only affected computations run
    print(""\nAdding new data row:"")
    df.update(lambda d: pd.concat([d, pd.DataFrame({
        'temp': [24.5], 
        'humidity': [55], 
        'pressure': [1011]
    })]))
    # Stats and visualization automatically update
    
    # Change preprocessing method - again, only affected parts update
    print(""\nChanging normalization method:"")
    scaler_type.set('minmax')
    # Only preprocessing and downstream operations run
    
    # Change which features we're interested in
    print(""\nChanging selected features:"")
    features.set(['temp', 'pressure'])
    # Selected features, normalization, stats and viz all update

I think this approach might be particularly valuable for data science workflows - especially for:

* Building exploratory data pipelines that efficiently update on changes
* Creating reactive dashboards or monitoring systems that respond to new data
* Managing complex transformation chains with changing parameters
* Feature selection and hyperparameter experimentation
* Handling streaming data processing with automatic propagation

As data scientists, would this solve any pain points you experience? Do you see applications I'm missing? What features would make this more useful for your specific workflows?

I'd really appreciate your thoughts on whether this approach fits data science needs and how I might better position this for data-oriented Python developers.

1k9cz2s,[P] Tips for hackathon,"Hi guys! I hope that you are doing well. I am willing to participate in a hackathon event where I (+2 others) have been given the topic:

Rapid and accurate decision-making in the Emergency Room for acute abdominal pain.

We have to use anonymised real world medical dataset related to abdominal pain to make decisions on whether patient requires immediate surgery or not. Metadata includes the symptoms, vital signs, biochemical tests, medical history, etc (which we may have to normalize).

I have a month to prepare for it. I am a fresher and I have just been introduced to ML although I am trying my best to learn as fast as I can.

1k69uex,[D] Use Cases for Video Mapping/Timestamping Software for ML Training?,"\*\*Not a pitch, just curious about the industry insight. I'm already building the app for another use case and am not trying to promote, simply to get feedback if something like this would be useful to manual training for video models\*\*

TLDR: I'm currently building a web app that:

* Automatically loads videos from a source
* Allows users to directly cycle through the videos there
* Timestamp particular events by just pressing Enter, which is saved to a database that can be exported
* Mark or fill in any additional parameters that are needed
* Add or remove the parameters (custom fields) as needed
* Has auto audits and field restrictions that prevent misentries
* Creates a dashboard for statistical analysis of the parameters afterwards, based on the user's needs
* Potentially includes a peer-review workflow option

The problem that I'm trying to solve (for a particular use case which I can't disclose), is that currently the users are operating as such:

* Having to juggle through multiple video links that are all on a spreadsheet
* Go back and forth between the video and Excel or Spreadsheets to write in data
* Often missing key moments as they can't just capture the exact timestamp
* Assigning the videos for review through the spreadsheets as well

This is obviously quite inefficient and prone to user error, whereas the system that I'm designing minimizes the mistakes while making it much easier for the users to organize and use their data afterwards, instead of juggling many spreadsheets, video links, and generating their dashboards.

I thought that this might be useful for ML projects that potentially have teams of people who analyze videos manually for data training, but I wanted to get input from people in the industry. There is also potential for peer review workflows that are, as far as I know, a real pain.

1k69pq4,Looking for collaboration [R],"[R]

Hey, I'm Nehal Nevle.
I’ve worked across the robotics stack — from building self-driving vehicle prototypes to designing ADAS systems. I specialize in reinforcement learning, simulation, and robotic product development, with a strong focus on planning and prediction. I’ve led teams, shipped real-world systems, and now I’m excited to get back to research with a scrappy, focused project.

Looking for Collaborators – CoRL 2026 Paper (Dual-Arm Coordination with PPO)

I’m putting together a small team to work on a research project targeting CoRL 2026 (also open to ICRA/IROS). The focus is on dual-arm robot coordination using PPO in simulation — specifically with Robosuite/MuJoCo.

This is an independent project, not affiliated with any lab or company — just a bunch of passionate people trying to make something cool, meaningful, and hopefully publishable.

What’s the goal?

To explore a focused idea around dual-arm coordination, build a clean and solid baseline, and propose a simple-but-novel method. Even if we don’t end up at CoRL, as long as we build something worthwhile, learn a lot, and have fun doing it — it’s a win. Think of it as a “cool-ass project with friends” with a clear direction and academic structure.

What I bring to the table:

Experience in reinforcement learning and simulation,

Background building robotic products — from self-driving vehicles to ADAS systems,

Strong research process, project planning, and writing experience,

I’ll also contribute heavily to the RL/simulation side alongside coordination and paper writing.



---

Looking for people strong in any of these:

Robosuite/MuJoCo env setup and sim tweaking

RL training – PPO, CleanRL, reward shaping, logging/debugging

(Optional) Experience with human-in-the-loop or demo-based learning



---

How we’ll work:

We’ll keep it lightweight and structured — regular check-ins, shared docs, and clear milestones

Use only free/available resources

Authorship will be transparent and based on contribution

Open to students, indie researchers, recent grads — basically, if you're curious and driven, you're in


If this sounds like your vibe, feel free to DM or drop a comment. Would love to jam with folks who care about good robotics work, clean code, and learning together.

1k6qwtv,"[R] We've implemented Python’s ChatterBot inside Java for lightweight, local NLP Integration","Hey ML enthusiasts!

We're a startup that is working on a cross-language integration tool called Javonet and we've recently explored an approach to embed a Python-powered chatbot (ChatterBot) directly into a Java application without spinning up servers, APIs, or containers.

Using Python [ChatterBot](https://github.com/gunthercox/ChatterBot) (a trainable rule-based engine) and Javonet, we've built a Java integrated chatbot that:

* Runs entirely locally
* Is trained in Python, but called from Java via in-process bridging
* Requires zero API endpoints or REST setup

# Our step-by-step approach:

1. **Set up ChatterBot in Python:**
   * Install: `pip install chatterbot`
   * Train a bot using the English corpus (simply execute one line of code)
2. **Create a Java project** (Maven-based):
   * Add Javonet SDK dependency.
   * Execute Javonet and spin up an in-memory Python runtime.
3. **Invoke Python directly from Java:**
   * Use Javonet’s runtime bridge to call `ChatBot`, train it, and get responses — no REST, no serialization, no HTTP.
4. **Extract chatbot response:**
   * ChatterBot returns a `Statement` object; just pull the `.text` field.

We've found that it's perfect for MVPs, desktop apps, or internal tools where you want quick conversational features without complex infrastructure.

1k51qlv,[P] How do I detect cancelled text,"How do I detect cancelled text

So I'm building a system where I need to transcribe a paper but without the cancelled text.
I am using gemini to transcribe it but since it's a LLM it doesn't work too well on cancellations. Prompt engineering has only taken me so so far. 

While researching I read that image segmentation or object detection might help so I manually annotated about 1000 images and trained unet and Yolo but that also didn't work. 

I'm so out of ideas now. Can anyone help me or have any suggestions for me to try out?

 cancelled text is basically text with a strikethrough or some sort of scribbling over it which implies that the text was written by mistake and doesn't have to be considered.

Right now, vLLM is amazing at serving a single model really efficiently. But if you’re running 10+ models (say, in an agentic environment or fine-tuned stacks), switching models still takes time and GPU overhead.

1k94nj1,[D] Ignoring AI/ML in my MVP — Here’s how I fixed it (and why your startup should care),"# Hey Everyone,

I almost killed my startup by treating AI/ML as a ""future problem."" Big mistake. After struggling with poor user retention and clunky features, I finally integrated machine learning into our MVP. The results? Mind-blowing.

**Here’s what I learned the hard way:**  
**AI ≠ Sci-Fi**: You don’t need a $10M budget. We started with 200 data points and a simple recommendation engine.  
**Users expect smart apps**: Our MVP’s 40% drop-off rate vanished after adding personalized onboarding (thank you, Python + TensorFlow).  
**The hidden cost of waiting**: Competitors using AI scaled 3x faster.

**Biggest surprises:**

* Cloud AI tools (AWS SageMaker) were cheaper than hiring junior devs
* Reddit’s own [r/MachineLearning](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/) community saved me from terrible model biases

**Full story & step-by-step guide here:** [Integrating AI/ML Into Your MVP](https://dranolia.medium.com/integrating-ai-ml-into-your-mvp-a-beginners-guide-a5ae5501ddb9)

**Discussion starters:**

* Has anyone else tried adding ML to their MVP?
* What’s the dumbest AI mistake you’ve made? (Mine: training a model on test data )
* Are no-code AI tools actually viable for startups?

1k4geso,Ever met a person you think lied about working in Data Science?,"You ever get the feeling someone online or in-person just straight up lied to you about having a Data Science job (Data Scientist, Data Analyst, Data Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, Data Architect, etc.)?

I was recently talking to someone at a technical meet-up for working professionals and one person was saying some really weird stuff. It was like they had heard of the technical terms before, but didn't actually have the experience working with the technologies/skills. For example, they mentioned that they had ""All sorts of experience with Kafka"" but didn't know that it is a tool that Data Engineers and related professionals could use for their workflows. They also mixed up the definitions of common machine learning models, what said models could do for a business, NoSQL & SQL, etc. It was jarring.

Also, sometimes I get the impression that a minority of people on this subreddit come on and lie about ever having a Data Science job. The more obvious examples are those who post the Chat-GPT answers to post questions. No shade thrown to anyone here. I encounter many qualified people here and have learned new stuff just reading through posts.

Any of you ever had an experience like that?

**Edit:** Hello all. Thank you for all of the responses on this post. I have gotten some good perspective, some hilarious comments, and some cool advice. I appreciate all of you on this sub-reddit.

I do want to say that I do not believe that all Data Scientists need to know Kafka (or any other specific tech. I don't know a bunch of stuff). I brought up the Kafka example because it was the most egregious (the person claimed to have all these years of experience, but didn't know a bunch of stuff including the basics). The conversation was 35 minutes, so I only wanted to bring up the outliers/notable examples.

And I want to emphasize that I was talking about **all** Data Science jobs (Data Scientist, Data Analyst, Data Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, Data Architect, etc.).

1k8hjp4,This environment would be a real nightmare for me.,"YouTube released some interesting metrics for their 20 year celebration and their data environment is just insane.

- Processing infrastructure handling 20+ million daily video uploads 
- Storage and retrieval systems managing 20+ billion total videos
- Analytics pipelines tracking 3.5+ billion daily likes and 100+ million daily comments
- Real-time processing of engagement metrics (creator-hearted comments reaching 10 million daily)
- Infrastructure supporting multimodal data types (video, audio, comments, metadata)

From an analytics point of view, it would be extremely difficult to validate anything you build in this environment, especially if it's something that is very obscure. 
Supposed they calculate a ""Content Stickiness Factor"" (a metric which quantifies how much a video prevents users from leaving the platform), 
how would anyone validate that a factor of 0.3 is correct for creator X? That is just for 1 creator in one segment, there are different segments which all have different behaviors eg podcasts which might be longer vs shorts

I would assume training ml models, or basic queries would be either slow or very expensive which punishes mistakes a lot. You either run 10 computer for 10 days or or 2000 computers for 1.5 hours, and if you forget that 2000 computer cluster running, for just a few minutes for lunch maybe, or worse over the weekend, you will come back to regret it.

Any mistakes you do are amplified by the amount of data, you omitting a single ""LIMIT 10"" or use a ""SELECT * "" in the wrong place and you could easy cost the company millions of dollars.
""Forgot a single cluster running, well you just lost us $10 million dollars buddy""

And because of these challenges, l believe such an environment demands excellence, not to ensure that no one makes mistakes, but to prevent obvious ones and reduce the probability of catastrophic ones.

l am very curious how such an environment is managed and would love to see it someday.

I like my current org but it's a very narrow field of work so I might want to move on in 2-3 years. I see a lot of postings (both internally and externally) require a Masters, so I'm wondering if I'm putting myself at a disadvantage by not having one.

My current employer has tuition reimbursement up to ~$6k a year so I was thinking of doing a part-time Masters (something like OMSCS, OMSA, or a statistics MS program offered by a local uni) - partially for the signalling of having a Masters, and partially because I just really love learning and I feel like the learning has stagnated in my current role... 

On the other hand I'm worried that doing a Masters alongside work will impact my ability to focus on my job & progression plans. I've already done two Masters courses part-time (free, credit-bearing but can't transfer them to a degree) and found it ok but any of the degrees I've been considering would be much more workload. 

Another option would be to take a year out between jobs and do a Masters, but with the job market the way it is that feels like a big risk.

1k76c0v,Step in the right or wrong direction long term?,"I’m a sophomore double majoring in Data Analytics and Data Engineering with a minor in Computer Science. (It sounds like a lot, but I came in with an associate’s degree from high school, so it’s honestly not a ton)

My end goal is to become a Data Scientist, ideally specializing in time-series forecasting or recommendation systems. I plan to go straight into a Master’s in Data Science after undergrad.

Today, I just got an offer for a Business Analyst Internship. The role focuses heavily on SQL and Power BI, but doesn’t involve any Python, machine learning, or advanced statistics. It’s a great opportunity and I’d be working with a Business Analytics team at a credit union, but I’m a bit torn.

Will having “Business Analyst Intern” on my resume make me look less competitive for future data science internships or full-time roles—especially compared to students who land internships with “Data Scientist” or “Data Science Intern” in the title?

I know I’m only a sophomore, and I don’t want to overthink it, but I also don’t want to unintentionally steer myself toward an analyst-only path.

1k5vy0i,Retailers I work with are already projecting 30%+ revenue loss over 2025. We haven't even begun to feel the damage from tariffs yet.,"I work at a SAAS company that provides services to retailers that sell things like clothing, home-goods, electronics, shoes etc. Think Levi-Strauss, Adidas, BestBuy.

My POCs are freaking out. One POC said their company is figuring out the feasibility of moving warehouses to other countries to avoid supply chain risk. One company told me their customers are calling them asking where their orders are–the packages are all being held in US ports until the customers ***pay the tariffs for the goods directly.*** Yes, you read that right. These companies are gonna lower revenue guidance by 30%+

Even if Trump and Xi agree to lower tariffs substantially (which seems unlikely to me – Trump has been consistently talking about tariffs on China for decades), I'm not sure how much of the damage can be walked back. Once a company has a freak out about supply chains and tariffs they're going to take action to mitigate risks in case orange face does it again. And there's no chance in hell they're going to be hiring in this kind of risky environment.

I think we're headed for years of negative real GDP growth. Besides unemployment from the retail sector, we're going to have million+ government works laid off by DOGE, and small to medium tech companies are going to lose contracts. (Who's gonna keep paying Hubspot or Monday a few hundred grand a year when GDP growth is negative)

Not much looks investable in this environment. The only thing I like are gold miners (GDX, GDXJ). Even if gold takes a healthy haircut here, the miners are priced as if gold is at like $2000 an ounce, not $3000. These are basically companies that turn oil into gold, and in a deep recession, oil prices will also drop.

1k5sxqo,The Market didn't care about Tesla's Earnings. Here's why. TLDR? It's not rigged,"Everyone’s tripping out about why Tesla is ripping after awful earnings, so here’s what’s actually going on,  and what might happen tomorrow and the next few weeks. Tesla reported after hours. Margins are down, revenue is weak, guidance is fuzzy, and Elon pulled out the usual robotaxi speech, tariffs are bad, cheaper cars, robots making cars.... But instead of tanking, the stock jumped. Why?

Short answer: markets don’t just trade the news,  they trade positioning and expectations.

Here’s how it works:

Before earnings, implied volatility (IV) was high. That means options,  especially puts,  were expensive. Everyone was hedging or speculating on a big drop. If you bought puts, you and everyone else were betting Tesla would move more than the expected range.

But Tesla didn’t crash. It didn’t even dip. It went up.

So tomorrow morning, we will likely see IV crush when IV drops hard after earnings. That’s where Vega comes in. Vega measures how much an option’s price changes in relation to its implied volatility (IV). If you’re holding puts, and IV collapses, those options lose value quickly, even if Tesla trades in your direction or sideways.

Now let’s talk about the feedback loop; this is where things get interesting. Market makers (dealers) are usually on the other side of all those puts. If they sell you a put, they’re taking on directional risk; if Tesla drops, they lose. So to protect themselves, they hedge.

For puts, that means shorting the stock to stay neutral. If the stock drops, their short hedge offsets their option losses.

But if the stock doesn’t drop,  or even worse, it goes up, they have to buy back their hedge to avoid getting wrecked. That buying pushes the stock price higher. And as the stock goes higher, they need to buy more to stay hedged. That’s a gamma feedback loop.

Add in short sellers covering their positions and a few retail traders chasing the pop, and suddenly you have a rally that feeds itself, even if the earnings were bad.

But it doesn’t mean the move is real or sustainable.

The big dogs (institutions) haven’t even acted yet. They’ll dissect the call overnight and into the next day. Some might sell the rip. Some might rebalance slowly over a few days. The real move sometimes doesn’t hit until later.

Let’s be real,  this game isn’t just about puts and calls. Market makers, hedge funds, and institutional players have access to insane levels of data. They have entire teams of quants, analysts, PhDs, and machines that track options flow, gamma exposure, CBOE positioning, bond yields, Fed swaps, commodities, FX correlations; you name it. They don’t just trade the headlines; they trade the reaction to positioning around the headlines. They model the crowd’s behavior before the crowd even makes a move.

If this were as simple as “bad earnings = buy puts,” everyone would be rich. But it’s not. The options market is one of the deepest and most complex systems on the market. That’s why insider trading is illegal, and why billionaires get into politics,  to legally front-run the economy and gain access to real-time information that actually moves markets. That’s why your broker has analytics for gamma exposure, skew, delta hedging zones, not because it’s nice to have, but because it’s necessary if you want to survive in this ecosystem.

Yeah, some retail traders make big money, sometimes,  but that’s gambling. Without context, you’re flipping a coin. 

This wasn’t about fundamentals. It was about positioning, hedging mechanics, and options flow.  
The market punished the crowded trade, as it always does.

So no, the system isn’t rigged. It’s just math, flow, and positioning. The market punishes the crowded trade. Too many people bet on a collapse, so the opposite happened.

Welcome to the dealer’s game.",the market didnt care about teslas earnings heres why tldr its not rigged everyones tripping out about why tesla is ripping after awful earnings so heres whats actually going on and what might happen tomorrow and the next few weeks tesla reported after hours margins are down revenue is weak guidance is fuzzy and elon pulled out the usual robotaxi speech tariffs are bad cheaper cars robots making cars but instead of tanking the stock jumped why short answer markets dont just trade the news they trade positioning and expectations heres how it works before earnings implied volatility iv was high that means options especially puts were expensive everyone was hedging or speculating on a big drop if you bought puts you and everyone else were betting tesla would move more than the expected range but tesla didnt crash it didnt even dip it went up so tomorrow morning we will likely see iv crush when iv drops hard after earnings thats where vega comes in vega measures how much an options price changes in relation to its implied volatility iv if youre holding puts and iv collapses those options lose value quickly even if tesla trades in your direction or sideways now lets talk about the feedback loop this is where things get interesting market makers dealers are usually on the other side of all those puts if they sell you a put theyre taking on directional risk if tesla drops they lose so to protect themselves they hedge for puts that means shorting the stock to stay neutral if the stock drops their short hedge offsets their option losses but if the stock doesnt drop or even worse it goes up they have to buy back their hedge to avoid getting wrecked that buying pushes the stock price higher and as the stock goes higher they need to buy more to stay hedged thats a gamma feedback loop add in short sellers covering their positions and a few retail traders chasing the pop and suddenly you have a rally that feeds itself even if the earnings were bad but it doesnt mean the move is real or sustainable the big dogs institutions havent even acted yet theyll dissect the call overnight and into the next day some might sell the rip some might rebalance slowly over a few days the real move sometimes doesnt hit until later lets be real this game isnt just about puts and calls market makers hedge funds and institutional players have access to insane levels of data they have entire teams of quants analysts phds and machines that track options flow gamma exposure cboe positioning bond yields fed swaps commodities fx correlations you name it they dont just trade the headlines they trade the reaction to positioning around the headlines they model the crowds behavior before the crowd even makes a move if this were as simple as bad earnings buy puts everyone would be rich but its not the options market is one of the deepest and most complex systems on the market thats why insider trading is illegal and why billionaires get into politics to legally frontrun the economy and gain access to realtime information that actually moves markets thats why your broker has analytics for gamma exposure skew delta hedging zones not because its nice to have but because its necessary if you want to survive in this ecosystem yeah some retail traders make big money sometimes but thats gambling without context youre flipping a coin this wasnt about fundamentals it was about positioning hedging mechanics and options flow the market punished the crowded trade as it always does so no the system isnt rigged its just math flow and positioning the market punishes the crowded trade too many people bet on a collapse so the opposite happened welcome to the dealers game,"market, put, tesla, trade, option",2025-04-23 07:03:21

1k71daq,A Very Rapid' Drop In Domestic Demand Is Hitting Airlines,"
Complement to a former post. 
Any jump in airlines stock price is just dancing around for now

The Travel crisis that is emerging will affect other industries that profit from tourism, like real estate and Banks

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/very-rapid-drop-domestic-demand-182820043.html

On the international front, for majors Airlines, Chinese and other Asian international tourists are crucial to their long-haul operations. Shanghai Pudong round trip to Dallas-Fort Worth is a common route that is seing drastic decrease for AAL.

A downturn in both leisure and business tourism leads to reduced hotel occupancy rates, lower room pricing, and decreased revenue, particularly in tourist-centric cities like Las Vegas, Orlando, and New York City.

Companies/stock potentially affected: Host Hotels & Resorts Inc., Park Hotels & Resorts Inc. 

Tenet Healthcare (THC) – Dallas, TX maybe affcted too. They owns hospitals and medical centers, some of which attract foreign patients for medical tourism.

Carnival Corporation (CCL) – Miami, FL, world’s largest cruise line, heavily dependent on international tourists, including Chinese travelers.

Royal Caribbean Group (RCL) – Miami, FL, same as Carnival, with an even more aggressive focus on Asia-Pacific expansion, including China-based cruise itineraries.

Airbnb: decrease of international travel and domestic travellers worrying about host calling Ice on them for deportation , just because why not?
Many Buffalo/NY small businesses rely on Canadian spending. If revenue drop, they cant pay rent, if they cant pay rent, landlords cant service mortage debt. More businesses will close like in covid or after covid.

Lennar Corporation (LEN) – Miami, FL, one of the largest homebuilders in the U.S has lot of Chinese buyers: Florida (and Texas) have been targets for foreign real estate investment, particularly by Chinese nationals seeking EB-5 visas or U.S. property. So real estate may be affected too, in this case, may be it will relieve pressure on prices, not sure. But for REITS (real estate investment trusts) that owns properties leased to Hotels and restaurants or Malls or international student housing that depends on international travellers or Transit/transcient business, trouble are ahead in all major US Cities. 

Event Spaces & Convention Centers: A reduction in MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, Exhibitions) activities weakens demand for event spaces and the surrounding businesses that support them. ALL major hotels brand affected.

Diversified REITs: These entities, with portfolios spanning retail, hotel, and mixed-use developments in major gateway cities, face indirect impacts from the downturn in tourism and international student presence: Vornado Realty Trust (VNO), BXP, Inc. (BXP)

The third financed asset in size for all major banks after government bonds and other bank is real estate ( commercial and residential)

also, if all foreign countries keep rejecting boeing planes delivery like china, it is the whole aerospace sector that is going down with all of the small industries and SMEs that their business model feeds.

Complement to a former post. 
Any jump in airlines stock price is just dancing around for now

The Travel crisis that is emerging will affect other industries that profit from tourism, like real estate and Banks

On the international front, for majors Airlines, Chinese and other Asian international tourists are crucial to their long-haul operations. Shanghai Pudong round trip to Dallas-Fort Worth is a common route that is seing drastic decrease for AAL.

A downturn in both leisure and business tourism leads to reduced hotel occupancy rates, lower room pricing, and decreased revenue, particularly in tourist-centric cities like Las Vegas, Orlando, and New York City.

Companies/stock potentially affected: Host Hotels & Resorts Inc., Park Hotels & Resorts Inc. 

Tenet Healthcare (THC) – Dallas, TX maybe affcted too. They owns hospitals and medical centers, some of which attract foreign patients for medical tourism.

Carnival Corporation (CCL) – Miami, FL, world’s largest cruise line, heavily dependent on international tourists, including Chinese travelers.

Royal Caribbean Group (RCL) – Miami, FL, same as Carnival, with an even more aggressive focus on Asia-Pacific expansion, including China-based cruise itineraries.

Airbnb: decrease of international travel and domestic travellers worrying about host calling Ice on them for deportation , just because why not?
Many Buffalo/NY small businesses rely on Canadian spending. If revenue drop, they cant pay rent, if they cant pay rent, landlords cant service mortage debt. More businesses will close like in covid or after covid.

Lennar Corporation (LEN) – Miami, FL, one of the largest homebuilders in the U.S has lot of Chinese buyers: Florida (and Texas) have been targets for foreign real estate investment, particularly by Chinese nationals seeking EB-5 visas or U.S. property. So real estate may be affected too, in this case, may be it will relieve pressure on prices, not sure. But for REITS (real estate investment trusts) that owns properties leased to Hotels and restaurants or Malls or international student housing that depends on international travellers or Transit/transcient business, trouble are ahead in all major US Cities. 

Event Spaces & Convention Centers: A reduction in MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, Exhibitions) activities weakens demand for event spaces and the surrounding businesses that support them. ALL major hotels brand affected.

Diversified REITs: These entities, with portfolios spanning retail, hotel, and mixed-use developments in major gateway cities, face indirect impacts from the downturn in tourism and international student presence: Vornado Realty Trust (VNO), BXP, Inc. (BXP)

The third financed asset in size for all major banks after government bonds and other bank is real estate ( commercial and residential)

also, if all foreign countries keep rejecting boeing planes delivery like china, it is the whole aerospace sector that is going down with all of the small industries and SMEs that their business model feeds.

1k62347,Bessent Says No Unilateral Offer From Trump to Cut China Tariffs,"Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that President Donald Trump hasn’t offered to take down US tariffs on China on a unilateral basis.

There has been no unilateral offer from Trump to reduce tariffs on China, Bessent told reporters Wednesday in answering questions after a keynote speech at an Institute of International Finance event in Washington.

Trump on Tuesday had said that US tariffs “will come down substantially but it won’t be zero,” and that he didn’t see the need to “play hardball” with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

Bessent said that the Trump administration is looking at multiple factors with regard to China beyond just tariffs — including non-tariff barriers and government subsidies. He also said that the strongest relationship between Washington and Beijing is at the top, and that there was no timeframe for engagement. He said that a full rebalancing of trade might take two to three years.

Trump said separately on Wednesday that the US is going to have a fair deal with China.

The Treasury chief also said that the US and India are “very close” on a trade agreement. He reiterated that a satisfactory arrangement doesn’t mean an actual trade document — signaling, as he has before, that initial deals with trading partners will be a broad framework rather than a detailed trade agreement.",1745422253.0,1661,319,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1k62347/bessent_says_no_unilateral_offer_from_trump_to/,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-23/bessent-says-no-unilateral-offer-from-trump-to-cut-china-tariffs,s1n0d3utscht3k,wallstreetbets,0.97,False,False,False,False,0,1745835428.893734,Finance & Business,11,218,227,Wednesday,11,April,2025,False,0.9776,0.129,0.031,0.84,positive,Bessent Says No Unilateral Offer From Trump to Cut China Tariffs,"Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that President Donald Trump hasn’t offered to take down US tariffs on China on a unilateral basis.

1k9azf5,Is This Market Bounce a Trap? Rising Risks Could Signal More Downside (April 2025),"The market bounced last week.
But don’t be fooled — this is classic fakeout territory.
Here’s why:

Historical Patterns After Crashes:
- In 2008, the S&P jumped +19% — then collapsed another -28%.
- In 2000, Nasdaq bounced +40% — only to plummet -70%.
- In 2020, a +10% bounce quickly turned into a -35% crash.
→ Early recoveries are often just a setup for the next drop.

Today’s Risks (April 2025):
- Trump’s tariffs on China and global imports continue to rise, creating massive inflationary pressure.
- This will crush margins and slow growth, while keeping the Fed stuck.
- No rate cuts in sight — just higher taxes and stagflation risks.
- Corporate earnings already under strain. Revisions getting ugly.
- Credit stress is rising. Spreads are widening.
- Retail is still all-in, buying this dip with no clear catalyst for recovery.

Bottom Line:
- History shows that first green candles after selloffs are headfakes.
- The market’s core fundamentals are weakening, not improving.
- This rally is probably just short covering and FOMO — not real recovery.
- Real bottoms happen after fear — not wishful thinking.

TLDR:
This bounce is dangerous. With rising tariffs, inflation, and collapsing earnings, the real risk is much lower, not higher.

Historical Patterns After Crashes:
- In 2008, the S&P jumped +19% — then collapsed another -28%.
- In 2000, Nasdaq bounced +40% — only to plummet -70%.
- In 2020, a +10% bounce quickly turned into a -35% crash.

1k7th50,GDPNow Atlanta FED Q2 Recession ✨⚡️THUNDERDOME⚡️✨,"TL;DR: The official government predictions that predict whether we are in recession or not will come out April 30th. GDP Numbers for Q1 are reported and estimates for Q2 are released from April 30th by the BEA and Atlanta Fed. Q2 estimates will be negative because of the 90 day tariff extension and the market hasn’t realized it yet. 

#GDP = C + I + G + (X - M)

Chances are, we have been in a recession since January 1st. This will become very apparent after April 30th. Not because of the Q1 QDP report, but because of the Q2 estimates that begin to be released that day. Current expectations are for slight growth in Q2, but there’s good reason to think otherwise and news hits that GDP will detract, it will bring the market down and fit the definition of a recession that is two quarters of negative GDP growth. 

##What has already happened:

At the end of last February, aka the last market high, the [Atlanta Fed rapidly started dropping their GDP Now estimates](https://www.atlantafed.org/cqer/research/gdpnow.aspx), why? Because of the sharp spike in imports to the United States to preempt Trump's tariffs. That’s the moment the market started taking Trump's tariff seriously and acting on it. From that moment, we knew we would have at least one negative quarter of GDP growth, but it takes two to tango and as long as Q2 wouldn't be negative as well, we would avoid fitting the definition of a recession. From this info, we know that when tariffs are announced for a future date, firms will import ahead of time to get around it. 



##What is yet to happen:

What would cause Q2 to be negative if importers already imported everything ahead of liberation day? Well the only thing I can think of that would push us down that route would be if the majority of the tariffs got pushed back by exactly one quarter at the beginning of April, say- I don't know ***90 days***, like exactly before the end of Q2 so that importers had another opportunity to import more before the tariffs kick in again. Like specifically if I had to cause a recession, that'd be my play book. Announce tariffs to kill one quarter of GDP growth, and then push them back exactly one quarter to kill the next. Genius.

Here’s what I expect is going to happen that hasn’t been priced in yet: importers are going to create another large net export trade deficit to get around the 90 day trigger, consumption will decrease as Americans brace for a recession, and we are going to have a second negative quarter despite all expectations. 


##What it means:

Why is fitting the actual definition of a recession bad? (you ask, retardedly) Because it kills the fucking vibes. Consumers react to what's in the news. These things compound on each other, consumption is another component of GDP. If one quarter is down 3% and the next quarter is +0.1%? Recession narrowly avoided a la the 2022 Vibesession. The next quarter is down -0.1%? We're cooked, because that's when news agencies go from nebulous articles about ""the possibly of a recession"" to ""freak the fuck out and panic sell everything, we are officially in a recession right now"". Technically the soonest the government would officially call a recession that started in 2025 is July 30th, 30 days after Q2 ends when the reports get dropped. 

Here's the flip side, if the GDP estimates *don't* go negative throughout Q2, it will take a long time for another recession risk to form. The two negative quarters have to be consecutive to meet the definition. There would have to be *another* two quarters of negative GDP growth to kill that. So if numbers don't look bad after April 30th, bulls are gonna win this one. 

Here's how I'll be wrong: importers sit on their ass and don't import before the 90 day extension is up, because they already filled warehouses in Q1 or they just don't care. OR, foreign countries begin ""kissing his ass"", a deal gets struck and the tariffs come down. OR, a cosmic particle strikes the neurons in Trump's head like a transistor flipping in a Super Mario speedrun and he takes them all down. 

##How we will know:

Here's the key part of how all this gets called. The Bureau of Economic Analysis [releases their first official GDP report](https://www.bea.gov/news/schedule) for a quarter 30 days after that quarter ends, and the Atlanta FED begins releasing their estimates for the current quarter 30 days after it begins. That means **April 30th** is the day of days when we will know the final numbers for Q1, which will be bad, and we will know the estimates for Q2. **If the Q2 estimates are bad on April 30th, that is the same as the Atlanta Fed predicting a recession.** This is what we don't know, but based on how importers reacted last time to change in tariffs, and how the Fed reacted to them, I would imagine this brings down GDP estimates. 

##Assumptions I am making:

-The definition of a recession as two quarters of negative GDP growth is a good and accurate definition, and that people will freak out when we are projected to meet that definition. 

-A large amount of trade deals won’t get made in the next quarter. 

-Importers will create a large trade deficit that brings down GDP because of the 90 day tariff extension. 

-The market hasn’t already priced this in. 

There’s plenty of reasons to expect one of those assumptions to be wrong. Do your own DD. Tell me how I’m wrong below.

Well the only thing I can think of that would push us down that route would be if the majority of the tariffs got pushed back by exactly one quarter at the beginning of April, say- I don't know ***90 days***, like exactly before the end of Q2 so that importers had another opportunity to import more before the tariffs kick in again. Like specifically if I had to cause a recession, that'd be my play book. Announce tariffs to kill one quarter of GDP growth, and then push them back exactly one quarter to kill the next. Genius.

Here’s what I expect is going to happen that hasn’t been priced in yet: importers are going to create another large net export trade deficit to get around the 90 day trigger, consumption will decrease as Americans brace for a recession, and we are going to have a second negative quarter despite all expectations. 


##What it means:

Why is fitting the actual definition of a recession bad? (you ask, retardedly) Because it kills the fucking vibes. Consumers react to what's in the news. These things compound on each other, consumption is another component of GDP. If one quarter is down 3% and the next quarter is +0.1%? Recession narrowly avoided a la the 2022 Vibesession. The next quarter is down -0.1%? We're cooked, because that's when news agencies go from nebulous articles about ""the possibly of a recession"" to ""freak the fuck out and panic sell everything, we are officially in a recession right now"". Technically the soonest the government would officially call a recession that started in 2025 is July 30th, 30 days after Q2 ends when the reports get dropped. 

Here's the flip side, if the GDP estimates *don't* go negative throughout Q2, it will take a long time for another recession risk to form. The two negative quarters have to be consecutive to meet the definition. There would have to be *another* two quarters of negative GDP growth to kill that. So if numbers don't look bad after April 30th, bulls are gonna win this one. 

Here's how I'll be wrong: importers sit on their ass and don't import before the 90 day extension is up, because they already filled warehouses in Q1 or they just don't care. OR, foreign countries begin ""kissing his ass"", a deal gets struck and the tariffs come down. OR, a cosmic particle strikes the neurons in Trump's head like a transistor flipping in a Super Mario speedrun and he takes them all down. 

##How we will know:

Here's the key part of how all this gets called. The Bureau of Economic Analysis [releases their first official GDP report](https://www.bea.gov/news/schedule) for a quarter 30 days after that quarter ends, and the Atlanta FED begins releasing their estimates for the current quarter 30 days after it begins. That means **April 30th** is the day of days when we will know the final numbers for Q1, which will be bad, and we will know the estimates for Q2. **If the Q2 estimates are bad on April 30th, that is the same as the Atlanta Fed predicting a recession.** This is what we don't know, but based on how importers reacted last time to change in tariffs, and how the Fed reacted to them, I would imagine this brings down GDP estimates. 

##Assumptions I am making:

-The definition of a recession as two quarters of negative GDP growth is a good and accurate definition, and that people will freak out when we are projected to meet that definition. 

-A large amount of trade deals won’t get made in the next quarter. 

-Importers will create a large trade deficit that brings down GDP because of the 90 day tariff extension. 

-The market hasn’t already priced this in. 

There’s plenty of reasons to expect one of those assumptions to be wrong. Do your own DD. Tell me how I’m wrong below.

",gdpnow atlanta fed q recession thunderdome tldr the official government predictions that predict whether we are in recession or not will come out april th gdp numbers for q are reported and estimates for q are released from april th by the bea and atlanta fed q estimates will be negative because of the day tariff extension and the market hasnt realized it yet gdp c i g x m chances are we have been in a recession since january st this will become very apparent after april th not because of the q qdp report but because of the q estimates that begin to be released that day current expectations are for slight growth in q but theres good reason to think otherwise and news hits that gdp will detract it will bring the market down and fit the definition of a recession that is two quarters of negative gdp growth what has already happened at the end of last february aka the last market high the atlanta fed rapidly started dropping their gdp now estimates why because of the sharp spike in imports to the united states to preempt trumps tariffs thats the moment the market started taking trumps tariff seriously and acting on it from that moment we knew we would have at least one negative quarter of gdp growth but it takes two to tango and as long as q wouldnt be negative as well we would avoid fitting the definition of a recession from this info we know that when tariffs are announced for a future date firms will import ahead of time to get around it what is yet to happen what would cause q to be negative if importers already imported everything ahead of liberation day well the only thing i can think of that would push us down that route would be if the majority of the tariffs got pushed back by exactly one quarter at the beginning of april say i dont know days like exactly before the end of q so that importers had another opportunity to import more before the tariffs kick in again like specifically if i had to cause a recession thatd be my play book announce tariffs to kill one quarter of gdp growth and then push them back exactly one quarter to kill the next genius heres what i expect is going to happen that hasnt been priced in yet importers are going

1k6iede,$TGT – Target is a Sitting Duck. I'm Buying Puts and You Should Too.,"The bull case for Target is dead. I’m loading up on puts like it’s 2008 and this place sells CDOs. Here’s why:

TL;DR:
Consumer spending is falling. Foot traffic is down. Earnings are flat. They're getting wrecked by Walmart, Amazon, and Costco. Their DEI pivot backfired and pissed everyone off. Tariffs are incoming. Margins are about to get smoked. I'm buying puts, and it’s looking real good.

Financials are soft:

Q4 2024 revenue: $30.92B (beat, but barely)

Full-year 2024 net sales: $106.6B, down from $107.4B in 2023

Full-year EPS: $8.86, down from $8.94

Stock is already down 20% over the past year

You can’t spin that into a growth story. Flat is the new down, especially with macro pressure.

People aren’t shopping there anymore:

10 straight weeks of declining in-store foot traffic

Cutting back DEI stuff alienated both sides of the aisle

Costco is scooping up their customers and their lunch

Curbside and online aren’t saving them like they used to

Tariffs + Recession = Profit Implosion:

Trump’s new tariffs are hammering imports from China, Mexico, and Canada

Target has to either eat the cost or pass it to consumers. Both suck.

Their CFO straight-up said consumer spending is cautious and soft

GDP forecast for Q1 2025 is negative. Recession vibes confirmed.

They’re getting crushed from all sides:

Walmart is cheaper and better positioned

Amazon dominates online

Costco is recession-proof and more beloved

Target is stuck in the middle, with no clear value prop

The trade:

Buying more Jan 2026 $70P and $65P

IV still reasonable for now

Tariffs + weak macro + earnings misses = real downside

If this cracks below $90 again, it could fall off a cliff.

Final thought:

This isn’t just a bearish play. This is a breakdown in identity. Target’s stuck trying to please everyone and is failing to please anyone. Consumers are broke, boycotting, and buying bulk from Costco. Their pricing isn't competitive. Their foot traffic is drying up. Their margins are at risk. And their best-case scenario is flat sales. Not exactly a growth story.

Short $TGT. Buy puts. Let the charts do the talking.

1k5524s,WSB - “We Choose to Baghold”,"My Fellow Regards,

I stand before you today not as a financial advisor, but as a herald of loss. Not to chart a course toward generational wealth, but to declare our sacred mission: to baghold together, until the bitter end.

We meet not in a moment of market clarity, but in the chaos of zero-DTEs and all-in YOLOs. In the last four weeks, we’ve bought calls on halted meme stocks, averaged down on AI pennies, and convinced ourselves that the tariff pause was bullish - even as futures bled red.

If this capsule of our regression teaches us anything, it’s that the regard trader - in his pursuit of gains and validation - will not be swayed by logic, risk management, or reality.

Some will ask:
Why go all in on a weekly call with no hedge?
Why buy the dip before it dips harder?
Why sit in the Wendy’s dumpster, watching red candles, hoping for Powell to blink?

We choose to baghold - not because we can, but because we must.

Because we are already deep in the call.
Because our average is trash, our liquidity is gone, and a bounce is the only thing standing between us and ruin.

Let every institution know - algo or whale - that WallStreetBets will bear any theta decay, ride any gamma wave, and misinterpret any macro signal, to do what no sane trader dares: stay the course, even as the account hits zero.

We do not act with caution, but with conviction.

I stand before you today not as a financial advisor, but as a herald of loss. Not to chart a course toward generational wealth, but to declare our sacred mission: to baghold together, until the bitter end.

We meet not in a moment of market clarity, but in the chaos of zero-DTEs and all-in YOLOs. In the last four weeks, we’ve bought calls on halted meme stocks, averaged down on AI pennies, and convinced ourselves that the tariff pause was bullish - even as futures bled red.

If this capsule of our regression teaches us anything, it’s that the regard trader - in his pursuit of gains and validation - will not be swayed by logic, risk management, or reality.

Some will ask:
Why go all in on a weekly call with no hedge?
Why buy the dip before it dips harder?
Why sit in the Wendy’s dumpster, watching red candles, hoping for Powell to blink?

We choose to baghold - not because we can, but because we must.

Because we are already deep in the call.
Because our average is trash, our liquidity is gone, and a bounce is the only thing standing between us and ruin.

Let every institution know - algo or whale - that WallStreetBets will bear any theta decay, ride any gamma wave, and misinterpret any macro signal, to do what no sane trader dares: stay the course, even as the account hits zero.

We do not act with caution, but with conviction.
Not with models - but with vibes.
Not guided by analysts - but by charts drawn in MS Paint at 2AM.

Because that is who we are.

1k4i5n9,"[DD] How to Profit Off the Tradewar II (~$800,000 Invested)","Hi all,

A couple of weeks back, I[ posted a \[DD\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jqfz91/dd_how_to_profit_off_the_trade_war_500k_invested/?rdt=52089) where I explained my trading strategy as tensions over trade between the United States and China continued to increase. We are now at an inflection point and I expect that several events over the next few weeks will send stocks in my preferred sector soaring. In this post, I’ll explain what these events are and I will provide an update on my portfolio as far as this sector is concerned.

My thesis, again, remains the same as it always was:

>**Thesis:** the mining industry presents a massive opportunity anywhere from right now to the end of the present US administration and hopefully beyond. The investments that will matter most have to do with the processing, extraction, separation, and manufacturing of titanium, lithium, and rare earth minerals deemed critical. These investments must be allied with western interests, ideally operating in the United States. The issue that is most relevant is the complete market dominance China has over these metals and rare earth minerals. 

**1. MP Materials Ceases Shipments to China (and why this is great news)**

The only vertically integrated operational rare earth mining and processing company in the United States is MP Materials. In previous posts, I canvassed a number of reasons to be bullish about this company, beyond the fact that they have the domestic side of the market locked down. These reasons included substantial stakes taken recently by institutional investors, as well as a number of executive actions and legislation.

This past Thursday, MP materials released a press statement noting that they have[ ceased shipments to China](https://mpmaterials.com/news/mp-materials-accelerates-strategy-to-reindustrialize-the-rare-earth-supply-chain/). This is significant, given their previous export history with China (and relatedly, their dependence on Chinese processing to refine their materials). They write:

>In response to China’s retaliatory tariffs and export controls, MP Materials (NYSE: MP) has ceased shipments of rare earth concentrate to China. Selling our valuable critical materials under 125% tariffs is neither commercially rational nor aligned with America’s national interest.

>We have been preparing for this moment since day one. Our mission, capital strategy, and execution reflect a long-term vision built to withstand short-term dislocation and emerge stronger.

I believe (in agreement) that any downward pressure on MP will be short-lived, although I am sure it will be volatile this week (today, very much so). The strategic timing of this press release, however, signals to me that they have already secured assurances from the present administration that they will support the company through purchasing agreements similar to those that will come from the planned executive order on[ stockpiling deep sea minerals. ](https://www.mining.com/trump-planning-to-stockpile-deep-sea-minerals-to-counter-china-ft/)

Moreover, ceasing shipments to China signals that MP materials has a margin of comfort with their capacity and ability to refine their own materials, such that they no longer feel bound to depend on China to process any of their materials whatsoever. Indeed, they write:

MP has invested nearly $1 billion to restore the full rare earth supply chain in the United States. Today, our California refinery is processing nearly half of our production, with virtually all of that material sold into markets outside China—including Japan, South Korea, and the United States.

**II. Critical Minerals Import Controls**

As if the above were not enough, the present administration recently issued an order to investigate critical minerals import controls[ *a la* Section 232](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-ensures-national-security-and-economic-resilience-through-section-232-actions-on-processed-critical-minerals-and-derivative-products/). The factsheet notes:

>\[This\] Order directs the Secretary of Commerce to initiate a Section 232 investigation under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 to evaluate the impact of imports of these materials on America’s security and resilience. This investigation will assess vulnerabilities in supply chains, the economic impact of foreign market distortions, and potential trade remedies to ensure a secure and sustainable domestic supply of these essential materials.The investigation will culminate in a report detailing risks and providing recommendations to strengthen domestic production, reduce dependence on foreign suppliers, and enhance economic and national security. 

Following this report, the administration may well decide to impose tariffs on critical minerals, taking the place of any current reciprocal tariffs pursuant to the April 2 order tariff.

I recommend that each of you interested in this sector read the fact sheet in its entirety. It does a fantastic job explaining just how critical this investigation is and provides an overview of the issues plaguing the domestic side of the industry, including price manipulation by China.

**III. Ukraine Minerals Deal**

As if the two points above were not enough, the present administration also signaled today that Ukraine plans to negotiate and sign a minerals deal within the next few weeks. They’ve already signed an[ agreement by way of a memorandum.](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/17/nx-s1-5366821/trump-italy-meloni) 

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent predicts that the deal would be signed around April 26. 

>It's substantially what we agreed on previously when the president was here,"" Bessant said. ""We had a memorandum of understanding. We went straight to the big deal and an 80-page agreement and that's what we'll be signing.""

The question of what this agreement will look like in its final form is unknown. However, I would not be surprised if the raw materials obtained in Ukraine would be shipped to the USA for refining. If that were so, MP materials would stand to benefit tremendously. 

**IV. Portfolio Update**

Before signing off, I wanted to also provide an update on the holdings in my portfolio:

I hold a mixture of calls and shares in these positions. A number have already begun to return sizable gains. See, for example, recent profits from[ MP here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jz8w2l/the_mines_were_calling_400k_profit_day/).

1k9iwji,Credit debt and the implications of tariffs,"With tariff impacts not seen reaching out from the markets yet, it seems fairly difficult (at least to me) to fully grasp how bad this will actually affect the average American.

1k8fd10,Why there's a good chance Trump kills any deals Bessent brings him,"When it comes to Trump's tariffs on America's largest trading partners, there was not a lot of good news this week. No one's even pretending to have hope on Canada and Mexico. The EU is signaling they'll be patient, but it's pretty clear by that they mean they're willing to patiently wait for Trump to back down.

And China responded to Trump claiming talks were going well by *denying talks were happening at all*. It's also been reported that China is lifting its own retaliatory tariffs on some semiconductors and some pharmaceuticals, but that seems to be a matter of reducing the pain tariffs cause for China while keeping the pain on the for the US.

When it comes to America's second tier of trading partners—countries like India and Japan—there's more reason for optimism. Talks are at least actually happening. Unfortunately, whether any deals *actually* happen probably depends on how convincingly everyone else involved can lie to Trump and convince him the deals will do what he wants, when clearly no deal will do any such thing.

The problem, here, is that Trump's stated goal is the *total elimination of the US trade deficit.*Not that he regularly uses technical jargon like ""trade deficit"", but he talks constantly how much money we're ""losing"" from trade, and when he gives numbers they generally appear to be based on real statistics about the trade deficit.

For example, when Trump announced new tariffs on almost every country in the world on April 2nd, he claimed they were retaliation for other countries' tariffs, ""including currency manipulation and trade barriers"". But the actual numbers were just our trade deficit with each country in percentile terms. Trump appears to assume any trade deficit is in itself proof of unfair trade practices.

Similarly, he's consistently claimed that under Biden we were ""losing"" $2 billion a day to other countries. Sometimes the number is $3 billion—while taking questions in the Oval Office on Tuesday the number somehow got up to $5 billion—but $2-3 billion is consistent with the actual goods trade deficit for most of the Biden administration, which tended to be somewhere between $60 billion and $90 billion for any given month.

It's not really clear why you'd *want* to eliminate this trade deficit, since it's largely being driven the US being seen as a great place to invest in, creating enormous international demand for US stocks and bonds, including but by no means limited to US Treasuries. But even if you *did* want to eliminate the trade deficit, it's not clear what a series of deals with other countries to eliminate it would even look like.

That means the deals US trade negotiators are currently attempting to hammer out with their foreign counterparts *will not accomplish Trump's stated goals*. That, in turn, means selling those deals to Trump is going to depend on people bullshitting him into thinking the deals do things they will not and cannot do. Will it work? Maybe. I certainly can't blame people for trying.

But I also can't avoid seeing the parallels with what happened with Canada and Mexico in February and March. Trump threatened them with tariffs on February 1st, then announced a 30 day ""pause"" after Trudeau and Sheinbaum offered him a bunch of ""concessions"" that consisted mostly of things they were already doing. For a moment, it looked like catastrophe may have been averted by the power of sheer bullshit. But then, on March 4th, the tariffs went into effect on schedule.

Two days later, I went into my Vanguard account and sold more or less everything, abandoning my longstanding commitment to ""VT and chill"". So far, I don't regret it.

1k4keih,"[DD] Even If Elon Ditches DOGE for Tesla – It’s Too Little, Too Late","
There’s chatter that Elon might finally “refocus” on Tesla and distance himself from his side quests—most notably his weird obsession with Dogecoin. Bulls might think this is bullish: “He’s coming back! He’s serious again!”

But here’s the problem: he never left. He just stopped delivering.

🚫 Overpromising Is the Default Under Elon

Even if Elon announces he’s giving up on crypto clownery to zero in on Tesla, the core issue remains—his leadership style has fundamentally eroded trust.

Let’s look at the record:
	•	FSD “next year” since 2016 – still in beta, still not delivering revenue.
	•	Robotaxis by 2020 – we’re halfway through 2025.
	•	$25K Model? Vaporware.
	•	Cybertruck timeline? Delays, recalls, meme features (like bulletproof claims).

So, sure, maybe he tweets “I’m all-in on Tesla again,” but the Street has been burned too many times to believe it without tangible execution.

Sentiment Doesn’t Flip With a Tweet

The bigger issue? People just don’t like him anymore. And that matters.
	•	He’s aligned himself with culture war politics that have turned off core EV buyers.
	•	His Twitter/X activity has been erratic, controversial, and alienating.
	•	ESG investors and climate-focused funds are increasingly bailing on TSLA—not because of performance, but because they can’t sell “Elon” to clients anymore.

Saying “I’m focused now” doesn’t undo years of brand damage.


⚠️ Tariffs Are Still Crushing the Global Thesis

Even if Elon dials back the meme coins, the fundamentals don’t magically improve:
	•	US-EV tariffs are active (and Chinese LFP battery costs just went up).
	•	China just nuked S/X listings.
	•	EU could retaliate with their own tariffs.
	•	And Tesla is retreating from markets like Japan, UK, and Australia by discontinuing models.

This is structural. No PR pivot will fix supply chain pressure and margin hits.

🤔 Could Elon Turn It Around?

In theory, yes. If he:
	•	Delivered a real $25K model in 12–18 months.
	•	Partnered with OEMs for FSD licensing.
	•	Cleaned up comms, stepped back from X, and re-focused the brand.
	•	Resigned as CEO and brought in an operations-focused leader.

But let’s be real—Elon stepping aside from Dogecoin is not the same as stepping aside from being Elon. And his entire brand is built around showmanship, not execution.


Bottom Line

Even if Elon says he’s back, we’ve heard that song before—and the market’s tolerance for vapor promises is exhausted. Tesla is:
	•	A retreating brand.
	•	Losing trust.
	•	Still battling macro and regulatory headwinds.

Talk is cheap. Tariffs aren’t.

1k4gngq,One Trade a Day Keeps the Chaos Away,"Let’s keep it simple: in trading, less is more. You don’t need 5 setups, 30 videos, and 12 indicators on one chart. You need *one model*, *one time window*, and the *discipline* to wait for it.

The market isn’t a competition. You’re not here to beat someone else. You’re here to *see clearly* — and that only happens when you stop overloading your brain.

Here’s the truth: the model only shows up clean once, if you're lucky. And when you force it three more times a day, that’s not strategy — that’s ego.

That’s the game. One trade. One setup. One clear shot.

SBUX is up 2.4% today following analyst ratings 100-106 by Barclays, Bank of America and Wells Fargo. This company will be heavily impacted by tarriffs as your expensive beans don’t come from your grandpas farm in Kansas. If there’s an economic slowdown the first thing to go will be your 7$ cup of coffee on the way to work because you lost your job. Higher labor costs for the company caused by unions will continue to be a drag. Maxwell beans going to be selling like hotcakes as people look for cheaper coffee at DG. The bright spot is oil is cheap so the actual shipping cost may be less. 

Technicals

50 day ema crossed the 200 this week. 50 day  ema crossed 90 last week. Large outflows even on up days such as today. The stock is up about 2.4% right now and large order flow of sells is 2.92 million and buy sits around 1.5 million. If you’re into math that’s about 50% difference. The big guys are selling and the retailers buying 24.6 mil vs selling 21.8 mil. May find some support around 74.

1k7bw0g,"2008 Part 2, Electric Boogaloo","Abstract: By analyizing economic data it is clear that we are in the early stages of another financial crisis similar in scope to 2008's. The data surrounding debt and consumer savings all point to the same eventuality, that even without tariffs the economy has been held up by a string since before covid.

Introduction: While tariffs are at the forefront of everyone's conversations surrounding a possible recession, something much darker has been brewing in the background. Debt. In 2008 banks failed primarily due to Mortgage Backed Securities and Collateralized Debt Obligations failing as a result of defaults on mortgages rising. None of the people responsible ever faced any true consequences and many are still part of the financial system to this day (Scott Besset). I've been doing my own personal due diligence on the state of the economy and have come to the conclusion that no one learned their lesson. As a result, they're making the same mistakes all over again.

What banks are doing: CDO's and MBS's are extremely profitable for banks and investment firms to hold. Theyre basically large tranches of debt stacked together and sold off as a bond. After they failed in 2008 you would think that the banks would stop investing heavily into these instruments since they collapsed the world economy 17 years ago. They haven't. Speaking to a head portfolio manager at BNY I learned they're still heavily invested in these and have added in more consumer debt, credit card debt, and business loan debt called Collateralized Loan Obligations. While the manager seemed optimistic about the investments something he said stuck out to me when I asked about the rising rates of defaults.

""The Bank will be ok""

The BANK will be ok. He danced around it but admitted they were concerned over the rising rates, but the emphasis on the bank being ok made me realize, ""what about everyone else?"". The banks know that they will be bailed out if something happens, they were bailed out in 2008, and during covid JPOW turned the money printer on to keep things moving. They're banking on the idea that even though the bonds are known to be dangerous, the government will step in if things go south.

This is the ""Too big to fail"" mindset.

Debt Defaults: Everythings expensive. We went through 2 years of high inflation. While companies burned through the money they got during the covid years they are now laying off workers en masse, especially in the tech sector. This combines into people putting more and more on their credit cards due to inflation making things more expensive, then not being able to pay off those purchases since they were laid off.

This is the data from FRED

While in the years following 2008 credit card defaults/deliquencies fell (sharply after covid due to stimulus and not going out and buying things), they've recently begun to rise, coinciding with inflation rising. This directly affects the CDO's and CLO's that banks are so in love with.



Consumer Savings: People aren't saving as much as they were pre pandemic, the personal savings was around 6% pre-covid, now its bouncing around 3%.

This leads me to believe that people have less and less money in savings, causing them to put more on credit cards.

Tangent, klarna terrifies me, putting a burrito on afterpay is dystopic.

Consumer Debt levels: Consumer debt is hitting all time highs, its not going to slow down anytime soon, there's too much money in it for banks to NOT lend to people.

GDPnow Report: I know the markets are disconnected from logic at this point, but the AtlantaFed's GDPnow has been predicting negative growth since Feburary, the most recent estimate is -2.5% down from a 3.5% growth in January. I think -2.5% is a little low, but even if its off by a full 1% its still negative growth for the quarter. Proof that the economy is stagnating.

Conclusion, Im just an Econ major. My professors all share the same view, that we are in the early days of a recession. All this evidence isn't even accounting for the volatility of the current climate surrounding tariffs. I lost my job due to DOGE along with 200,000 other federal employees. Theyre paying us out until September to try and keep government spending up in hopes that it wont fuck with the GDP too much.

TLDR: Puts will print In the coming months

Heres my positions: don't make fun of them, I'm a college student, I keep all my money in Pokémon cards.

",part electric boogaloo abstract by analyizing economic data it is clear that we are in the early stages of another financial crisis similar in scope to s the data surrounding debt and consumer savings all point to the same eventuality that even without tariffs the economy has been held up by a string since before covid introduction while tariffs are at the forefront of everyones conversations surrounding a possible recession something much darker has been brewing in the background debt in banks failed primarily due to mortgage backed securities and collateralized debt obligations failing as a result of defaults on mortgages rising none of the people responsible ever faced any true consequences and many are still part of the financial system to this day scott besset ive been doing my own personal due diligence on the state of the economy and have come to the conclusion that no one learned their lesson as a result theyre making the same mistakes all over again what banks are doing cdos and mbss are extremely profitable for banks and investment firms to hold theyre basically large tranches of debt stacked together and sold off as a bond after they failed in you would think that the banks would stop investing heavily into these instruments since they collapsed the world economy years ago they havent speaking to a head portfolio manager at bny i learned theyre still heavily invested in these and have added in more consumer debt credit card debt and business loan debt called collateralized loan obligations while the manager seemed optimistic about the investments something he said stuck out to me when i asked about the rising rates of defaults the bank will be ok the bank will be ok he danced around it but admitted they were concerned over the rising rates but the emphasis on the bank being ok made me realize what about everyone else the banks know that they will be bailed out if something happens they were bailed out in and during covid jpow turned the money printer on to keep things moving theyre banking on the idea that even though the bonds are known to be dangerous the government will step in if things go south this is the too big to fail mindset debt defaults everythings expensive we went through years of high inflation while companies burned through the money they got during the covid years they are now laying off workers en masse especially in the tech sector this combines into people putting more and more on their credit cards due to inflation making things more expensive then not being able to pay off those purchases since they were laid off this is the data from fred while in the years following credit card defaultsdeliquencies fell sharply after covid due to stimulus and not going out and buying things theyve recently begun to rise coinciding with inflation rising this directly affects the cdos and clos that banks are so in love with consumer savings people arent saving as much as they were pre pandemic the personal savings was around precovid now its bouncing around this leads me to believe that people have less and less money in savings causing them to put more on credit cards tangent klarna terrifies me putting a burrito on afterpay is dystopic consumer debt levels consumer debt is hitting all time highs its not going to slow down anytime soon theres too much money in it for banks to not lend to people gdpnow report i know the markets are disconnected from logic at this point but the atlantafeds gdpnow has been predicting negative growth since feburary the most recent estimate is down from a growth in january i think is a little low but even if its off by a full its still negative growth for the quarter proof that the economy is stagnating conclusion im just an econ major my professors all share the same view that we are in the early days of a recession all this evidence isnt even accounting for the volatility of the current climate surrounding tariffs i lost my job due to doge along with other federal employees theyre paying us out until september to try and keep government spending up in hopes that it wont fuck with the gdp too much tldr puts will print in the coming months heres my positions dont make fun of them im a college student i keep all my money in pokémon cards,"debt, bank, consumer, saving, due",2025-04-25 04:02:22

1k70ero,Everything about Google's earnings tonight,"Alphabet reports first-quarter earnings after today's closing bell. They're the second earnings report among the Magnificent Seven stocks which I'll be posting about on each of their earning days. Alphabet is following Tesla, which, despite disappointing results, gained after news of Elon Musk's increased involvement in the company's operations. 

So for GOOG, are we going in on calls or puts? I figured we'd at least need to be informed with what's in the know before deciding. In light of the widespread weakness among leading Big Tech companies (all of these companies have experienced higher declines than the broader US market since the beginning of the year), today's Alphabet earnings will be a significant test of how the company operates in a new environment dominated by uncertainty. I'm not only going to be interested in the financial data but I wanna see the message from the management indicating to investors whether Alphabet is navigating safely through our currently uncertain market.

**The Chart**

From a [TA perspective](https://i.imgur.com/uE3nJVz.png) a double bottom pattern may be forming on Alphabet's chart. If today's earnings results turn out to be a positive surprise and the stock price climbs above the $160.77 level, it could signal a reversal of the downward trend that has been affecting the tech giant's shares since the beginning of 2025. 

**Earnings**

For Q1, it looks like the market is expecting Alphabet to report revenue of $89.1 billion (+11% y/y). From what I've read, operating income is expected to reach $28.58 billion (+12% y/y). This stronger profit growth implies a slight margin improvement to above 32.08% (+0.45 pp). Tbh, it looks like effective cost management will be one of the biggest challenges for Alphabet in this environment. While sustaining strong revenue growth seems less at risk, managing expenses (especially given capital-intensive AI development plans) will be challenging.

**Cloud Services**

For those who are aware, Google Cloud is a thing and is driving massive growth for the company. With rivals signaling a slowdown in data center expansion amid rising uncertainty, Alphabet may either follow a cautious strategy (likely dampening growth) or seize the opportunity to gain market share by acting aggressively.

The second approach would be riskier and more costly, potentially causing erosion in the segment’s operating margin. It would, however, be an investment in the better future market position.

I'm going to be watching not just the quarterly results but also the forward outlook and management’s tone regarding the Cloud business. It looks like the Forecasted Cloud segment has a revenue of $12.32 billion for Q1 2025. This would be the h[ighest quarterly result in Alphabet's history](https://i.imgur.com/9uWUntD.png). However, operating income is expected to slightly decline versus the prior quarter, but at $1.94 billion it would still be over twice the result from Q1 2024.

**Tariffs** 

One of the key topics that I'll especially be closely watching tonight is the impact of tariffs and macroeconomic uncertainty on the company’s operations. Among the major Big Tech companies, Alphabet has shown the greatest resilience to potential geopolitical turmoil and has often demonstrated the fastest recovery following periods of uncertainty.

At this point, they do not appear to be in significantly better shape than its peers, with its stock down approximately 17% year-to-date, placing it squarely in the middle of the Magnificent Seven stocks.

I think the first step toward rebuilding investor confidence will be outlining the scope and impact of tariffs and overall geopolitical uncertainty on the company’s operations. As such, the types of questions I expect during today’s conference about how strongly tariffs will affect Alphabet’s business. It is worth noting that this isn’t necessarily about the direct impact (which is likely to be limited) but rather the indirect effect of uncertainty on the willingness of Alphabet’s clients to spend on advertising, which constitutes a significant portion of the company’s revenue.

**Price Targets**

Amid these earnings expectations, analysts have been revising Alphabet's price targets downward. Over the past few weeks, [several top analysts have revised their 12-month price targets for Alphabet](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/goog/forecast?utm_source=theglobeandmail.com&utm_medium=referral). TD Cowen lowered its target from $210 to $195. UBS cut its target from $209 to $173. Even Scotiabank lowered its target from $232 to $200. Despite that, they all still rate GOOG stock as a Buy, showing they believe in its long-term value.

Guggenheim lowered its target from $215 to $190, while Jefferies adjusted its target from $235 to $200, both maintaining a Buy rating. Piper Sandler and Citi followed suit, reducing their targets to $185 and $195 respectively, citing uncertainties in the advertising landscape and macroeconomic pressures.

I mean. With all things considered, the stock is down 19% in 2025 so far. Combine that with rising legal risks (mentioned later here) and an uncertain economy, and you have a good reason to reframe expectations. Analysts aren’t necessarily predicting more downside; they’re just being more realistic about the upside, especially in the near term.

If we’re to simplify the analysts’ overall message, it’s that Alphabet’s fundamentals are strong, but the road ahead could be bumpy.

**In the news**

A federal court recently ruled that Google violated antitrust laws by monopolizing specific digital advertising markets. The court plans to determine suitable remedies soon. Some analysts believe the ruling could eventually lead to the divestiture of certain Google ad segments, though the financial impact on Alphabet is expected to be modest.

There’s also the bigger picture. Between global tariffs, economic uncertainty, and shifts in labor and costs across the tech industry, Alphabet has a lot on its plate. Investors will want to hear how the company manages expenses, hiring, and regional exposure.

**Mergers and Acquisitions**

Alphabet announced a $32 billion all-cash deal to acquire cloud security platform Wiz. This acquisition aims to enhance Google Cloud’s security capabilities and multi-cloud operations. Analysts are projecting long-term benefits from this acquisition, despite potential short-term market pressures on other cloud service providers.

Separately, Google has decided to maintain its current approach to offering third-party cookie choices in its Chrome browser, emphasizing the importance of online privacy and user control. This decision is part of Google's ongoing Privacy Sandbox initiative, which aims to strengthen online privacy while supporting a sustainable ad-driven internet environment.

**What now?**

Alphabet’s stock may be down, but most analysts still believe it’s a long-term winner. That’s why Buy ratings remain steady, even if price targets are down. Q1 earnings could be the reset moment Alphabet needs to win back momentum. I'm thinking short term puts for earnings but holding long term shares. Could even sell covered calls for earnings for some extra income, if you already have the shares.

SPY $755 12/19 Call - 200 buys

SPY $770 12/19 Call - 200 buys

SPY $825 12/19 Call - 1500 buys

SPY $830 12/19 Call - 750 buys

MY ARGUMENT

I. The Setup No One Sees Coming

You’ve seen this before. Not the chart. The moment. A sharp drop. A confusing headline. Everyone bails. The algorithms freeze. And then, boom - the narrative flips, and everything rips. That’s the setup right now. SPY is down, volatility is up, and everyone’s arguing about tariffs like it’s Econ 101. But underneath that? A $0.14 option is hiding in plain sight. Deep OTM. December expiration. Sitting there like a scratcher ticket no one scratched. This isn’t a normal trade. It’s a cheap swing at a high conviction reversal. The kind of bet that looks dumb right before it doesn’t.

II. Trump Does What Trump Does

Trump negotiates like he’s writing headlines. Go big, go scary, then walk it back and declare victory with a simple tweet. It’s not theory — it’s his playbook: NAFTA, NATO, North Korea, China (round one). Every time: chaos first, deal later. Now he’s back, and he’s swinging tariffs again. The first shot was expected — China. But then he blindsided everyone by going after Canada and Mexico too. Europe followed. Suddenly it wasn’t just a trade policy. It was a global pile-on. But Trump always wants a win. And wins, for him, come fast. If he starts rolling back these tariffs - even if China stays frozen - the market doesn’t need a resolution. It just needs a direction.

III. What the Math Says

As of April 17, 2025, SPY closed at $526. The $760 call expiring December 19 is priced at $0.14. Using a projected mark of $678 and the same moneyness ratio (678/760), the equivalent August 15 strike is $590 and closed at $5.15. That $678 level isn’t fantasy. It’s the pre-tariff SPY close of $612 plus the same 10.8% gain SPY posted over the same stretch last year. At a cost of $0.14 and a value of $5.15, the return is 36x.

IV. The COVID Rebound: Redux

That 2020 move? Everyone remembers it. But instead of a deadly pandemic, it’s a tariff detour that will unwind - no vaccine required - by just two thumbs pecking out a tweet only one man on Earth can - “the tariff war is over - victory is in hand” - DJT. This isn’t a hedge. It’s a shot. A reset bounce puts this $0.14 option in the money with room to run. That’s not moonshot math. That’s just how mispricing works when everyone’s looking the other way. COVID showed us what happens when sentiment flips. This setup’s cheaper, simpler, and it doesn’t need a Fed bazooka or a warp speed cure— just a shift in tone and a headline worth chasing.

1k5b0z2,Everything about Tesla's earnings tonight,"Tesla is releasing their earnings tonight, and because they tend to move quite a bit with earnings, I wanted to see if we could try to bet on it. Either calls or puts.

Tesla generally moves ±10%, and shot up last two earnings but down badly the one prior in July 2024. 

For tonight's first-quarter earnings and revenue, from what I've read, it looks like a lot of analysts are *already* predicting poor results. They see see EPS down 9% to 41 cents a share, though more recent forecasts point to a further slide. Revenue should fall a fraction to $21.27 billion, with the sharp consensus pointing to a 7% decline to $19.76 billion. Tesla Q1 consensus earnings projections have come down more than 40% since the end of 2024. The Q1 EPS target was $3.31 just before Tesla's Q4 earnings release.

What's interesting is that in Q4, Tesla's net income was boosted by a recent change in how companies account for holdings of digital currencies. This policy change resulted in an earnings per share add-on of 68 cents in Q4, with a net income increase of $600 million. So the price of corn could actually really influence the results today.

[The company delivered 336,681 EVs in Q1](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-stock-market-tesla-deliveries/), down 13% vs. a year earlier and the lowest since Q2 2022. They fell 32.1% vs. Q4's record 495,570 EVs. The bright spot is Tesla China, where sales appeared to edge higher vs. a year earlier, but those tend to be lower margin. U.S. and European sales have tumbled on Musk's brand woes. Tesla also deployed 10.4 gigawatt-hours of energy storage products in Q1, down slightly vs. Q4's record 11 GWh but up 156% vs. a year earlier.

I've looked at a few articles regarding EVs, it looks like auto gross margins excluding regulatory tax credits of 13.1%, compared to 16.4% a year ago. The average selling price per vehicle coming in at $37,910 in Q1, down from $43,790 in Q1 2024.

So this is what I'm expecting for today: As usual, the focus will be on Elon and the earnings call. Tesla is also changing things up and have said ""in addition to posting first quarter results"" it ""will hold a live company update and question and answer"" session. What this means is anybody's best guess. He in the past has repeatedly said earnings calls are not for product announcements. Could this mean he'll give significant details on the new affordable vehicle? Or could it be similar to the recent all-hands company meeting where he told employees to hold onto their Tesla stock, touting the future of artificial intelligence and robotics?

In any case, I'm more-so interested to see if he sticks to his forecast for unsupervised, self-driving ride hailing in Austin this June, any details about the ""affordable"" vehicle, if he sees delivery growth in 2025 after a weak Q1 and sluggish start to April and what are his plans around his work with the Trump White House. Honestly all this Trump stuff has seemingly [hurt sales](https://abcnews.go.com/Business/tesla-deliveries-drop-13-amid-backlash-ceo-elon/story?id=120412167) and dropped the stock. But there isn't really much we can know about the precise impact on Tesla’s bottom line until tonight. 

It's already been reported that Tesla will delay its upcoming ""affordable"" EV by at least three months. Tesla had said it planned production of a lower-cost vehicle by mid-year, but various reports had suggested it would come in late 2025 or 2026. The latest report said production will start in the U.S., followed by China and Europe. They have not given any details about the EV, but multiple reports have said it'll be a stripped-down Model Y rather than a new form factor, like a hatchback.

I honestly think he needs to leave government and be a full-time CEO for Tesla. Right now his temporary status as a government employee expires next month, so he will face questions about his plans during the call. He really needs to lay out the timeline/hard facts around the rollout of autonomous vehicles and robotics over the next 6-12 months. I want answers on when the new lower cost vehicle will hit the production line. Honestly, if he chooses to stay with the government it could change the future of Tesla/brand damage will grow. Not good. 

In addition to this, rival automakers saw huge sales gains as consumers pushed up purchases to avoid tariffs, which began on April 2. Tesla's main rival overseas, BYD, has been eating into Tesla's market share for some time now. So with this, I'm considering puts or a put spread. Considering the stock is up 6%, puts are at a discount now. Since the stock usually goes up or down 10%, I would target the 230 or 225 strike price with 4/25 exp date. We also have Google earnings on Thursday, so I'm going to be looking at that as well.",1745340240.0,194,219,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1k5b0z2/everything_about_teslas_earnings_tonight/,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1k5b0z2/everything_about_teslas_earnings_tonight/,DangerousBrat,wallstreetbets,0.87,True,False,False,False,0,1745835527.975771,Finance & Business,5,811,781,Tuesday,12,April,2025,False,0.9427,0.094,0.074,0.832,positive,Everything about Tesla's earnings tonight,"Tesla is releasing their earnings tonight, and because they tend to move quite a bit with earnings, I wanted to see if we could try to bet on it. Either calls or puts.

Tesla generally moves ±10%, and shot up last two earnings but down badly the one prior in July 2024. 

For tonight's first-quarter earnings and revenue, from what I've read, it looks like a lot of analysts are *already* predicting poor results. They see see EPS down 9% to 41 cents a share, though more recent forecasts point to a further slide. Revenue should fall a fraction to $21.27 billion, with the sharp consensus pointing to a 7% decline to $19.76 billion. Tesla Q1 consensus earnings projections have come down more than 40% since the end of 2024. The Q1 EPS target was $3.31 just before Tesla's Q4 earnings release.

1k8cbl5,Hertz: Here's Why I'm Planning To Get In With OTM Puts,"# Summary of my Bear Case

* The high short interest led to a spectacular rally following Bill Ackman's fund announcement of a 4.1% stake in the Hertz.
* Bloomberg just announced (April 25) that the company is looking to raise $500 million through debt or (and this is key) **equity**.
* I believe the company will dilute investors at the start of next week. That will probably lead to a selloff (like it is usually the case, after an equity offering).
* I'm planning to buy OTM puts, with a price target of $5 over the next 2-3 months. I am not a degen (despite my profile name), so I need theta to be on my side, baby!
* I believe Hertz could be cooked. Revenue is down, despite decent utilization rates. That means the company is renting cars at lower prices to keep demand.
* Tariffs will most likely not improve its vehicle's residual values, as Trump may pause sectoral tariffs on autos.
* Airlines have recently reported a decline in air travel. Considering that 65% of the company's revenue comes from airport locations, that is another headwind to consider.
* Overall, I believe the AI / robotaxi infrastructure nonsense is not alligned with the company's simplification strategy. I have big doubts Bill Ackman will be able to pursue management into this business venture.

# Fundamentals

Both Americas and International revenues are down, yoy.

https://preview.redd.it/etiyipbsy5xe1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=858fb1e84fd69f7a1ac5106d8a8e50dec9f91fbf

Here is the yoy variation:

Americas:

* Q4 2024: -7.5%
* Q3 2024: -5.1%
* Q2 2024: -4.3%
* Q1 2024: 0.5%

International:

* Q4 2024: -2.1%
* Q3 2024: -3.2%
* Q2 2024: 0.7%
* Q1 2024: 7.6%

Overall, worldwide vehicle rental revenue is down by -3.4% yoy in FY 2024. Big drop compared to the 20.6% increase in FY 2023 or the 56% increase in FY 2022.

From a profitability perspective (EBIT**DA),** things look raw (to say the least). Just look at the trend below. By the way, that's earnings **BEFORE** depreciation.

When taking into account DEPRECIATION, things look even more raw.

|Depreciation per unit (DPU), net|Guided $350–375|Actual $347 (**gross**)|< $300/month/unit|

On the **Buy Right** strategy. From the Q4 earnigns call:

>*Our risk vehicles … have an average cap cost almost 30% lower than our existing fleet of model year ’22 through ’24 car buys*

In plain English: Compared to the cars they bought in 2022–2024, the new cars (for 2025) cost 30% less on average.

>*We've got committed model year '25 buys locked in at the economics that foot to that \[sub-$300 DPU\] metric*

What is the DPU: depreciation per vehicle per month. In plain English: how much a vehicle looses value per month due to depreciation.

The thing is. $300 DPU is not a sneeze. Take a look at the DPU trend below.

https://preview.redd.it/29pt5fsn16xe1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dca0fbbb37791873434c76c3bac93f67ce890b15

Does that look scary? It seems that the depreciation in the US is way more pronounced than in the EU.

Here's the deal, baby! The median of the ""total DPU"" since 2019 was **$253**. Things changed after the pandemic, you may say. Fair enough. Here is the median of the ""total DPU"" (total meaning both US and International cars) since Q1 2022: **$284.**

Let me be clear. The target of <$300 per month is only bringing back the company to the base line after the pandemic. That baseline is still high compared to pre-pandemic levels.

On their **Hold Right** strategy: A car’s biggest value drop happens in the first 1–2 years. But if Hertz keeps cars very new (fleet mostly < 1 year old), depreciation per month becomes predictable and lower.

From the earnings call:

>As of year-end 2024, over 60 % of our fleet was comprised of vehicles 1 year old or less.

On the **Sell Right** strategy:

In Q4 2024 alone, they sold 100,000 vehicles, compared to just 30,000 in Q4 2023. Less than 10% sold in auctions (lower prices) and they are prioritizing their retail selling channel (higher prices due to add-ons, like financing).

Management is bullish on tariffs:

>If tariffs … increase new car prices, the counterbalance is likely residual values will go up, which will help our business model

I am not. Here is why: Trump is chickening out of sectoral tariffs on autos after CEOs complained. Check recent news on this topic. I am seemingly now allowed to post links.

# The Bear Case

Here is a strong pillar of my bear case:

Take a look at utilization rates over past few years. Notice the seasonality, which is 100% normal.

https://preview.redd.it/bcf0lr3436xe1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b0a2aebc330d934d53fae0d818fc911c4e1cfdb

WTF is the utlization rate? In plain English: how much a vehicle is being rented (i.e. generating $$$) during the quarter.  80% utilization rate means that 4 out of 5 days, the car is rented out. Not bad, right! The trend looks fine. Here is the yoy variation in utilization rates:

* Q4 2024: 1.3%
* Q3 2024: -1.2%
* Q2 2024: -2.4%
* Q1 2024: -1.3%

The trend (when adjusted for seasonality) is flat, which is great... or is it?

Take a look at the trend in total revenue per transaction day. In other words, how much HTZ is makin' per vehicle per day, on average, during the quarter, both in Americans and Intl.

https://preview.redd.it/7hyrezlc46xe1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ecfb3a484a174c1df90c2b79f018844b9b16d45

The trend looks raw.

Here's the thing: to keep the same utilization rates (in other words, to keep their vehicles rented out), the company has to lower the daily rates to maintain demand. Here is the seasonally adjusted variation in revenue per transaction day in 2024:

* Q4 2024: -2.4%
* Q3 2024: -0.7%
* Q2 2024: -3.2%
* Q1 2024: -6.9%

Speaking of raw trends, here is a chart showing interest expenses over the past few years:

https://preview.redd.it/xlk85vyg56xe1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=0821c8360c6c43e7b94c95bc8bd2133570ba4115

Here is the yoy variation in interest payments:

* Q4 2024: 19.3%
* Q3 2024: 9.3%
* Q2 2024: 26.1%
* Q1 2024: 33.3%

Here is an interesting chart of the nearest debt maturities:

# The Pershing Square Deal

Bill Ackman's fund owns now 4.1% of HTZ. Possibly the first step of an activist campaign to influence management on the direction of the company. (when they reach 5% ownership, the fund must file either a 13D or 13G).

Morgan Stanley teased the AI case for the company. To my eyes, BS. Here is why:

It seems that the Street is bullish on autonomous vehicles (i.e. robotaxis) requiring ""downstream fulfillment infrastructure"" that could be implemented at HTZ rental locations.

Look. Hype works when the S&P 500 is hitting all time highs. Now, hype it's not a good bet. Tesla's robotaxies are operating on Tesla's own infrastructure. Same for Waymo. Hertz would need to burn a lot in CapEx to adapt their rental locations to accommodate robotaxis' operations. Not bullish, in my view.

Here is another reason I am sketched out by the rally. And this, is the final pillar of my bear case:

According to Bloomberg, Hertz Global Holdings is looking to raise $500M through additional debt **or equity offering.** This is key. This is a rumor. It's not officially announced by the company. There is no 8-K filed yet.

My point: if the company dilutes investors now that the share price is up (which is quite common, just look at quantum stocks in Q4 last year), that will lead to a selloff. Simple as that.

* The high short interest led to a spectacular rally following Bill Ackman's fund announcement of a 4.1% stake in the Hertz.
* Bloomberg just announced (April 25) that the company is looking to raise $500 million through debt or (and this is key) **equity**.
* I believe the company will dilute investors at the start of next week. That will probably lead to a selloff (like it is usually the case, after an equity offering).
* I'm planning to buy OTM puts, with a price target of $5 over the next 2-3 months. I am not a degen (despite my profile name), so I need theta to be on my side, baby!
* I believe Hertz could be cooked. Revenue is down, despite decent utilization rates. That means the company is renting cars at lower prices to keep demand.
* Tariffs will most likely not improve its vehicle's residual values, as Trump may pause sectoral tariffs on autos.
* Airlines have recently reported a decline in air travel. Considering that 65% of the company's revenue comes from airport locations, that is another headwind to consider.
* Overall, I believe the AI / robotaxi infrastructure nonsense is not alligned with the company's simplification strategy. I have big doubts Bill Ackman will be able to pursue management into this business venture.

# Fundamentals

Both Americas and International revenues are down, yoy.

https://preview.redd.it/etiyipbsy5xe1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=858fb1e84fd69f7a1ac5106d8a8e50dec9f91fbf

Here is the yoy variation:

Americas:

* Q4 2024: -7.5%
* Q3 2024: -5.1%
* Q2 2024: -4.3%
* Q1 2024: 0.5%

International:

* Q4 2024: -2.1%
* Q3 2024: -3.2%
* Q2 2024: 0.7%
* Q1 2024: 7.6%

Overall, worldwide vehicle rental revenue is down by -3.4% yoy in FY 2024. Big drop compared to the 20.6% increase in FY 2023 or the 56% increase in FY 2022.

From a profitability perspective (EBIT**DA),** things look raw (to say the least). Just look at the trend below. By the way, that's earnings **BEFORE** depreciation.

https://preview.redd.it/yfum8bbvz5xe1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=adf99de745f069c965942d41baf0997f2631b31c

When taking into account DEPRECIATION, things look even more raw.

https://preview.redd.it/7rvznrpb06xe1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d37b1679a22a66b3926e71d7b03328b10d05086

What's the company doin' about this?

**Buy Right, Hold Right, Sell Right** strategy --> Back to Basis roadmap

Here's a summary:

**TL;DR:** Trump is making a big show of tariffs, but when the dust settles, Canada will remain America’s closest trade partner. MTW is stupid cheap.

Thesis:

• **Housing demand:** Their cranes are *critical* for U.S. and Canadian multifamily construction. Housing shortages aren’t going away — we have to build. 

• **Cash:** They have positive free cash flow and reasonable reserves. Unless they burned through it since their last 10K, they can take another year or more of punishment.

• **Tariffs are overblown:** Strong U.S. ties, Pittsburgh manufacturing, and growing footprint in Africa/Europe help diversify away from Canada risk. Accelerated orders after April 2nd could actually offset some of the Tariff impacts. 

**Caveat:** If their cash position tanked since the last 10K, my thesis crumbles. I expect short-term volatility. I’m DCA’ing and using bullish puts when spreads are fat.

Not financial advice. Do your own research. I am an internet stranger with too many tabs open.

# Commentary

This week, the WSB Composite P/C dropped to the lowest level on record (records began March 1, 2025), falling to 0.66 on Wednesday, dragged by a What Are Your Moves Tomorrow thread P/C of 0.47, also the lowest on record. The WSB/CBOE ratio fell to a record low of 1.22 on Wednesday.

All WSB P/C measures hit a low on Wednesday, except for the Daily Discussion P/C, which fell to 0.8 Tuesday. CBOE P/C fell to 0.54 on Tuesday and Wednesday, the weekly low. Investors relaxed after a four-day winning streak for the major indices, and WSB degens are no exception.

On Thursday, the difference between thread P/Cs reached zero, the second time on record. The difference inverted to 0.39 from negative values on Monday, Tuesday, and Friday. Moreover, the WSB/CBOE ratio started rising aggressively after Wednesday's low. In the week ahead, investors should be careful for a spike in CBOE P/C, indicating a lack of investor confidence.

1k6kg0r,+$162k UGL Gain,"When the specter of tariffs began to take shape, I started loading up on safe-haven assets as a short-term hedge against any volatility in international affairs.  I took out a small position in UGL and a much larger position in GLD, both of which track the gold market.  Most of my purchases were made in late February and early March.  I added some more to those positions in April to take advantage of the upward momentum.

I managed to time the local peak in the spot price of gold rather well.  I closed my UGL position for a six-figure gain.  I am paring my GLD position and will likely be realizing a seven-figure gain once I am finished selling.

I am not quite sure when I will completely rotate out of the latter position, though.  There are a few reasons for this.  Foremost, I still see significant uncertainty with regards to international trade.  I do believe that, in the short term, this will continue to cause the price of gold to rise against a number of currencies.  It is also entirely possible that we could witness a decline and then an aggressive melt up in the price of gold if negotiations break down substantially and the equities market is forced to digest what is effectively a trade embargo against either one or more countries.  For the contrarian view, we are either one tweet, wayward comment, or press conference away from the equities market rallying and the price of gold being temporarily depressed.  All of this uncertainty is additionally being driven by one individual who folds at the slightest bit of resistance.

For those who are curious about a follow-up play, I added to my holdings of BRK-A with the proceeds from these trades.

1k7akc9,Life insurance denied after my brother’s suicide — looking for advice,"My brother died by suicide in November 2024. It has been the most traumatic experience of my life—and something my family and I are still navigating every day.

My mom remembered that he had a life insurance policy with Aflac, something he told her about years ago. She’s the personal representative of his estate and has spent the last five months trying to navigate the claims process, which has been an absolute nightmare.

She’s had to send and resend documents, often by fax (even though they clearly have email), only to be told Aflac never received them. Every time she called, she had to re-explain what happened—that her son died by suicide. That part alone was retraumatizing. She was constantly told to call back later or start over.

Eventually, a mutual friend connected us with a VP at Aflac, and only then did someone finally get in touch with her. And when they did, it was just to say the claim was denied due to suicide. No copy of the full policy- just a basic page. No clarification about the listed beneficiary. No proof of signatures. No offer of premium refunds. Just: “Denied.”

But here’s the thing—this policy has been active for years. I’ve read that most suicide exclusions in life insurance policies only apply within the first 1-2 years of the policy being active. If that’s true, wouldn’t he be past that period? And even if they’re within their rights to deny, isn’t there at least a refund of premiums?

This entire process has been exhausting and so deeply unfair. My brother’s longtime girlfriend and two young children were supposed to receive $200k from this policy—money that would’ve made a huge difference for their lives. Now, nothing.

Has anyone dealt with something like this? Any advice on how we can fight this or at least get some transparency? A lawyer? A complaint to a state insurance commissioner? Anything? We are in New Mexico.

It has been the most traumatic experience of my life—and something my family and I are still navigating every day.

My mom remembered that he had a life insurance policy with Aflac, something he told her about years ago. She’s the personal representative of his estate and has spent the last five months trying to navigate the claims process, which has been an absolute nightmare.

She’s had to send and resend documents, often by fax (even though they clearly have email), only to be told Aflac never received them. Every time she called, she had to re-explain what happened—that her son died by suicide. That part alone was retraumatizing. She was constantly told to call back later or start over.

Eventually, a mutual friend connected us with a VP at Aflac, and only then did someone finally get in touch with her. And when they did, it was just to say the claim was denied due to suicide. No copy of the full policy- just a basic page. No clarification about the listed beneficiary. No proof of signatures. No offer of premium refunds. Just: “Denied.”

But here’s the thing—this policy has been active for years. I’ve read that most suicide exclusions in life insurance policies only apply within the first 1-2 years of the policy being active. If that’s true, wouldn’t he be past that period? And even if they’re within their rights to deny, isn’t there at least a refund of premiums?

This entire process has been exhausting and so deeply unfair. My brother’s longtime girlfriend and two young children were supposed to receive $200k from this policy—money that would’ve made a huge difference for their lives. Now, nothing.

Has anyone dealt with something like this? Any advice on how we can fight this or at least get some transparency? A lawyer? A complaint to a state insurance commissioner? Anything? We are in New Mexico.

1k8rqmc,Child receiving life changing trust. How should we prepare them as they are growing up?,"Edit for clarification: there have been a lot of comments about withholding the trust for longer. The trust is not coming from us and will not be in our control. The only thing we have control over is raising our child to hopefully be able to successfully manage this asset. The most input we will have is perhaps whether to now consider a private school(which we had previously been considering anyways because of bullying issues at current school)


We recently learned that our child has inherited a life-changing asset from an extended relative. The asset will be in a trust that can only be used for educational and medical purposes until they are in their early 20s. The asset creates a significant yearly income which will be accruing for the next decade while it is in the trust, minus educational funds like college or potentially private school.

It is a huge blessing to know that our child will most likely be set for life! What should we be doing over the next few years to prepare them for the responsibility of this gift? Our child has ADHD and a difficult time with impulse control and executive function and we have a family history of addiction so we have always been worried about these next few years.

The gratitude about this situation is tinged with anxiety. Will this be a blessing or a curse? What can we do to prepare our child? We are thinking some kind of financial literacy classes and not sure what else.

It may take a few weeks or months for the details to be finalized so we have a little time to also think about how to explain and discuss this with them. We don’t want them to lose any motivation, if anything the opposite!

1k7tz4m,My boss has not paid me and I don’t know what to do,"I (25f) have been working for this employer for over 3 years. I met him in Mexico and I started working for his travel company since 2022. 
I am an American citizen and he currently lives in the USA too. (He is on a business visa, I am almost sure it is an E-2). He created his own company here and asked me if I wanted to work for him. 
This implies moving to the states and starting my life from zero: looking for a place to live, trying to build credit (since I have lived most of my life in Mexico), and so on. 

I did the move, I am now here in the states and he promised to pay me weekly. This is the third full week he has not paid me. I am highly considering getting a new job or even moving to Vegas where my dad’s side of the family is and where I did live for 10 years of my childhood.

I’m in Utah. He only pays me $13 an hour and he suddenly says he cannot afford to pay me my 40 hours so he needs to cut it to 20 hours starting on Monday. (Note he told me this on Tuesday). 

He also likes to victimize himself saying that he has nothing saved up and he needs to uber in order to pay my wage. It is not my problem he didn’t have a financial plan before launching a company. 

I’ve already been here for a month and a half, and I sometimes feel regretful believing in him. Any advice on what I should do? 

Since he said he would pay me weekly, I organized my payments around this, now I am behind. 

I have sent him messages and he ignores me. He comes to the office and does the Irish goodbye so he doesn’t have to encounter me to talk.

Also note that if I leave, he will no longer have any employees. Between the two, I am the only one who speaks English.

1k7qswe,Been working for 15 years and have almost nothing saved except retirement,"
I’m 33 and have nothing saved outside of retirement. I started making $21 at my first real “career” job at 23, and now I’m 32 and earning $45, but I still have nothing. I lived at home until 27. I’ve never bought a new car or any big-ticket items except for a new motorcycle ($7,000), which I sold after a year. I always spent my money on little things—mainly nicotine and marijuana products, eating out, or items costing $100, $200, or $300, sometimes more. If it was under $1,000, it didn’t stress me out too much. I always had a new phone and carried around $2,000 or $3,000 in debt. I spend money like water; my thought process is, “I’ll have more next week.” I know it’s the wrong way of thinking, but I just didn’t care, and it’s ruining my life. It’s bad.

My mindset is starting to change. I recently quit my bad habits, and reality is hitting hard, especially after doing the math on paper. I’m realizing how long it’s going to take to save up and how much I could have had if I’d just saved half of everything.

I need a plan before my girlfriend realizes I’m a loser and leaves me, and before I’m too old and unattractive. 
I have $55,000 in my 401(k), $60,000 in a Roth IRA, and $22,000 in an HSA. Outside of retirement, I have $4,000 in XRP and $1,500 in my checking account. My credit card balances total $2,100. I make $45 an hour and contribute $180 to my 401(k) right now, nothing to my Roth IRA, and $84 to my HSA. I have a 2004 Tacoma and a 2012 Honda Accord, both paid off. My portion of rent is $1,000, and my bills are about $400 a month.
I need to fix my life. I can work 15 hours of overtime if needed. I just need a plan to stop feeling like a loser. How fucked am i? I wanted to buy a house and start a family before im in my late 30s. Also im a high cost of living state. My one bedroom with 1.5 bath is $2000 and thats pretty cheap around here. Houses start at 500k. I don’t even know where to start.

1k6k0i0,Should I go into debt for an ivy college?,"Hey everyone! I recently got accepted as a transfer student to NYU, Columbia, and Hunter. It’s an exciting situation, but also a tough one financially.

NYU doesn’t offer financial aid for transfer students, unfortunately. Columbia offered me $32K (tuition is around 70k) but I’d still have to cover about $40K out of pocket. On the other hand, Hunter (tuition is around 19k) gave me a $5K scholarship and offered me another year of work as a tutor. With both, I’d only need to pay around $10K total for Hunter.

The Ivy League name is definitely tempting especially since I’d be the first in my family to attend college but Hunter’s offer is generous, and I’m also thinking about possibly applying to med school in the future to be a pathologist, I’m torn between choosing a more prestigious name or going with the option that’s more financially manageable.

My family lives paycheck to paycheck, so this decision means a lot. I’d really appreciate any thoughts or advice. Thanks so much!


Edit: although I do understand that having a prestigious college can have their benefits, it also depends on the major, for Columbia and NYU I was accepted into their Biology science major, while for Hunter I was accepted into their Med lab tech major. The way I see it, if I were going for law school or maybe business I would take Columbia without doubt but it's Biology.... if I were to graduate hunter with a Med lab tech I can find a job after graduation and save for med school while graduating with Biology even from Columbia would make me run in circles trying to find a job since it's more of a ""base degree"" than an actual career ""major""

My family lives paycheck to paycheck, so this decision means a lot. I’d really appreciate any thoughts or advice. Thanks so much!


Edit: although I do understand that having a prestigious college can have their benefits, it also depends on the major, for Columbia and NYU I was accepted into their Biology science major, while for Hunter I was accepted into their Med lab tech major. The way I see it, if I were going for law school or maybe business I would take Columbia without doubt but it's Biology.... if I were to graduate hunter with a Med lab tech I can find a job after graduation and save for med school while graduating with Biology even from Columbia would make me run in circles trying to find a job since it's more of a ""base degree"" than an actual career ""major""

Btw thank everybody for your input!!",should i go into debt for an ivy college hey everyone i recently got accepted as a transfer student to nyu columbia and hunter its an exciting situation but also a tough one financially nyu doesnt offer financial aid for transfer students unfortunately columbia offered me k tuition is around k but id still have to cover about k out of pocket on the other hand hunter tuition is around k gave me a k scholarship and offered me another year of work as a tutor with both id only need to pay around k total for hunter the ivy league name is definitely tempting especially since id be the first in my family to attend college but hunters offer is generous and im also thinking about possibly applying to med school in the future to be a pathologist im torn between choosing a more prestigious name or going with the option thats more financially manageable my family lives paycheck to paycheck so this decision means a lot id really appreciate any thoughts or advice thanks so much edit although i do understand that having a prestigious college can have their benefits it also depends on the major for columbia and nyu i was accepted into their biology science major while for hunter i was accepted into their med lab tech major the way i see it if i were going for law school or maybe business i would take columbia without doubt but its biology if i were to graduate hunter with a med lab tech i can find a job after graduation and save for med school while graduating with biology even from columbia would make me run in circles trying to find a job since its more of a base degree than an actual career major btw thank everybody for your input,"hunter, columbia, med, major, college",2025-04-24 04:54:09

1k6yaj1,How much should we (37YO married couple) save for retirement if we are just starting now?,"After years and years of living as artist-types who's goal was to break even every month and have a little saved for emergencies, my wife is graduating from Veterinary school. She will be making much more than she used to (100k and potential for more in the future), and we will finally be in a position to start paying off our debt aggressively and then start saving for retirement.

However, we are both 37 years old, so we are definitely behind the curve.

Like many of you we never learned anything about finance/budgeting/debt/etc from our parents or schooling. However we are blessed to have woken up and are doing our best to correct that now.

In the last couple of years we have become serious budgeters and it has been a game changer. We plan on keeping our budget more or less the same as it is now (our current month budget is $4,500 per month in expenses, 54k annual). I don't want us to give into lifestyle creep, and to have a vision/plan for what to do with the extra money we will be making.

My big question now though that I could use some advice on is how much should we save every year for retirement, since we are starting late, for retirement? How much do we need to save every year to retire in the state of Mississippi (pretty low cost of living for the US), by 65 years old?

I understand that this is a ""that depends"" type of question, so please just treat it as a thought experiment. I understand that there are different answers to the same question. I'm actually interested in hearing all your different perspectives.

How much would you save every year if you were starting from nothing at 37, and wanted to retire by 65? And where would you put that money?

1k7ki2d,Parents meant to add me as an authorized user but ended up opening a Capital One account under my name with the wrong birth year — how do I fix this?,"When I was 17, my parents (not super tech-savvy) wanted to add me as an authorized user on their Capital One card. But instead, they ended up opening a credit card and checking account under my name using all my real info — just with the wrong birth year to make it seem like I was 18.

I’ve been using the accounts since then with no issues, and now I’m 19. I only found out the DOB was wrong when I recently tried to open a savings account.


I’m guessing it was a mistake, but now I need to fix the birthdate on file. Looked at the income, it says 27,000/yr and I made (and still) make $13.85 an hour, so if my math is correct that’s about right. Address is of course my real address, and birth month and day is the same, the year is just one year older than I actually am. Has anyone been through something similar? How do I go about correcting my date of birth with Capital One? Can this be done online or by phone, or do I need to go in person? What documents do they usually ask for?

Also, would I still be able to keep both accounts after fixing the DOB, or is there a risk they might close them since they were technically opened when I was under 18 and there’s no concerning activity on either account? I still would like to use Capital One and keep the good history on my credit report. I’m not even sure I can open another account at any bank because Capital One already reported that I was born one year before my actual birthday… So what should I do with the hundreds of dollars sitting in the checking account at this moment?

1k69thc,I’ve been getting paid incorrectly the last 3 years.,"Hello, I am looking for some advice. This year, payroll has been messing up our company’s paycheck. Some people had incorrect withholdings taken out, missed deposits, or incorrect pay rates. I thought I was ok until they asked us to double check our paychecks since some specific people had multiple errors. When I reviewed, I noticed my last paycheck, I saw I was getting paid overtime at straight time instead of time and a half. They corrected this immediately. 

However, when I reviewed other paychecks in my previous years (2024 and 2023) as our ADP goes back 2 years only, I realized all my overtime pay has been paid at straight time. I know people will say you should have been reviewing this, and I know I should have, but I do not do much overtime unless there are special projects going on. I also get call out pay that happens often and it was always paid out at time and a half, so I assumed my pay was correct since they were always increased. It’s just that my general hours that are over 80, besides call out pay, did not happen to trigger time and a half pay. 

I started in 2022, but could only review back to 2023 in ADP. I sent an itemized list with all my missing overtime pay (when I did not take any sick time as I can’t get overtime if I was sick) and asked to get access to review my paychecks in 2022. This was over a week ago and I haven’t heard back yet.

My questions:

1. How long does an audit like this take and for me to get my corrected pay? I know they will have to go back and do my overtime rate minus straight time rate to determine how much I am owed. 
2. Since I have gotten raises since I started, do they now owe me at my current payrate or will I get paid at my previous salary? My coworker mentioned they should owe me interest but I don’t know if that is how it works legally.

The reason this happened was because some workers only get paid overtime if they reach over 85 hours but for me it should start at 80 hours! I am located in Indiana in case that matters.

1k5jqia,Just got a random inheritance. Help please !,"Throw away for this post.

I have very little savings and I just inherited 140k$. Just met with a financial planner. Kinda worried about the implications of all this. This money could be life changing down the line if invested correctly.

He’s suggesting 70% mutual funds (of course), 20% bonds and 10% gold. He wants to dollar cost average into the market over a 3 month period. Is the market too unstable to do this? I would hate to lose out on growth opportunities but would hate to look at my portfolio in 12 months and see I lost 20%. 

I know a little about investing but don’t feel confident enough to manage this kind of money on my own. 

I make over 100k and I have zero debt.

Looking for advice as this is stressing me out.

1k7l2ur,Turner company changed ESOP policy to bar lump sum payments specifically to stop me and others from selling this year.,"I worked for a company for 8 years that was under an ESOP. The agreement was we could take a lump sum of whatever the stock was worth a year after leaving the company. 

They lost a ton of contracts and 300-400 people lost their jobs (former company was blocking the new company taking over from contacting their employees, too, for further insult) and so this year some of those people are eligible to sell their stocks. 

I reached out to them to see when the process would start and they informed me they changed their policy to only allow 5 equal annual payments. They told me it was specifically because me and the others were coming eligible to sell. 

I  don't really know what I'm posting for, this just feels like it shouldn't be allowed? They're withholding money they promised us in an attempt to help the company.

The agreement was we could take a lump sum of whatever the stock was worth a year after leaving the company. 

They lost a ton of contracts and 300-400 people lost their jobs (former company was blocking the new company taking over from contacting their employees, too, for further insult) and so this year some of those people are eligible to sell their stocks. 

I reached out to them to see when the process would start and they informed me they changed their policy to only allow 5 equal annual payments. They told me it was specifically because me and the others were coming eligible to sell.

1k487gr,"Is ""Vortex Banking"" legit or a scam? Need advice about my mom's financial scheme brought up to me","I need some advice about this weird financial scheme my mom is pushing on me and my siblings. She sent us this Facebook post from some ""financial influencer"" talking about how rich people have these ""secret methods"" to build tax-free wealth called ""vortex banking."" 

For context: My siblings and I recently received modest five-figure inheritances from our grandfather (through an inherited IRA + distributions via check). None of us make over 5 figures annually, and my mom doesn't make even 1 But suddenly she's super excited about us using our inheritance for this scheme. I already said to my siblings do not put a single penny towards this.

I did some digging, and apparently ""vortex banking"" is just another name for ""infinite banking."" From what I can tell, it involves:

- Getting life insurance policies (whole life ones, not term)
- Putting these policies into some kind of irrevocable trust
- Creating our own LLCs under a holding company (mom specifically mentioned 2 for property and 1 for ""business investments""), this will somehow negate any taxes because your using the loses onto the trust? 

According to my mom's notes she took, this would supposedly let us ""be our own bank"" and get tax-free money we can take out. She's really pushing for all of us to pool our inheritance into this system and she is going to take out savings. I'm not that literate when it comes to finances and taxes, but from my experiences I do not trust any of this and I would really appreciate some better insight to explaining why to her as i am very concerned she will go through with this.

The most obvious being this is coming from a guy selling $1500 courses and saying all this outside his apartment, wearing clothing that makes him look like he's gonna be pulling a 10 hour drive hauling. Alongside this man is saying this strategy promising to eliminate taxes. 

Alongside, while reading into this, this seems like it would make more sense if we had 7 to 8 figures earned yearly. Reading all of this just seems like it'll wipe out any life insurance policy she puts through just from fees alone in the first few years. I don't see how this can work. 

I would really appreciate any insight or direction to explain to her why or what she's really trying to do. She has been dealing with financial problems and the last thing I need her to do is essentially screw herself over at an old age from a Facebook post.

So after careful consideration I decided that even with a tax penalty a small fraction of retirement would likely save a lot in the long run.

All of the options I mentioned above are simply things that a 403b plan may is allowed to offer, even the option to require all employees to involuntarily contribute a percentage of their pay to their 403b.

1k9nknd,Job offer seems too good to be true.. but I have worked my ass off,"I’m 25M I want to preface by saying I’m just curious because this has all happened so quickly and my family has historically not done well financially so I don’t feel comfortable going to them. My prior employer who hired me out of College and then went back to his old company wants me to follow him, I trust his opinions and he’s done very well for himself but I’m worried about leaving a great situation for “greener pastures” and getting burned. 

I graduated a year ago in March with a bachelors degree and landed a great job with a company of about 1,000 employees (laborers and office staff) they have “competitive salary” and a good 401k plan when you max it out, and pretty good other Bennies. (40% match of whatever you put in vs new offer of 3% dollar for dollar then .5 per dollar for the next 3%) 

I currently make ~82k and got a 3k bonus but received an offer at a Fortune 500 company with similar job duties for 100k plus annual bonus and company rig (before negotiations). Again this is my first year after graduating so that number immediately gave me sticker shock. 

Some additional information: current company si full of young up and comers so my chances of advancement are slowed due to people in their current positions plan on staying for a while. The new company wants to train me to advance quickly and move up the ladder, but I’m not sure their culture is quite as great as my current company.

Benefits are slightly worse with new company but still have health vision dental life at both.

1k6wko4,Buyers remorse? Anxious all night,"Update: Sorry for the late response. Work got in the way. 

I spoke with the GM. I told him about the conversation I had with the sales person on Tuesday as well as yesterday. Turns out sales person never told the GM (GM does not know what I am talking about). Turns out they were also charging me the full price to get new plates and tags, when I told the finance guy that I just wanted to transfer them (which he wrote on the folder and highlighter). I told the GM and he was able to see that. 

I told him that I want to return the car, he said that is not possible but he would be willing to trade the car in for another one. Which I said no to. I told him I would rather reverse the contract but unfortunately that’s not possible. I’m out of luck with that option. 

My plan is to pay more than minimum for a couple of months and once my credit is a bit higher, I’ll see what my refinance options are. That way I don’t end up paying 50k in the end. 

I’m also cancelling the extended warranty tomorrow at the dealership which would decrease my principal. They are also refunding me the fees for the tags which I’ll just put towards my payment. GEICO doesn’t offer gap so I’m going to see what my options are regarding that. 

Financially, I am in a good spot so I should be good these next couple of years. But man…lesson learned. Buyers remorse is such a heavy feeling. I can’t imagine how people who buy a house might feel! 

The car is beautiful and expressing my feeling on here definitely helped with all the anxiety I was feeling, so thank you! 

Financial literacy should be mandatory in school!

Semi update: First, thank you to everyone who replied. Reading through your comments helped ease the anxiety so much. I guess I just needed to vent. I called the dealership and they are going to call me back when the GM arrives. The finance guy is out for the day (of course he is) and I’m going to see what options I have and have them remove the extended warranty for sure. I will update as i get more info!

Hi, before I explain my situation, please be kind. The anxiety of it all has kept me up all night. 

Yesterday, I traded in my car for a new one. 
Here is the breakdown of my loan for a 2025 Nissan kicks SR: 

APR: 13.54
Finance charged: 1505.15
Amount financed: 31273.10
Total payments: 46775.75
Total price including down payment: 50035.25
Number of payments: 75
Monthly payment: 623.67

This includes GAP. It also includes the extended warranty which I told them I did not want so they snuck it in there…

I know this wasn’t the best financial decision but honestly I felt pressured. I went in alone. And when I was signing the loan agreements, well the finance guy was holding the pen and tapping the “sign here”for me. 

When I got home, I began to read my documents and realized that I would be paying 50k on a car that costs 31k. Then it hit me, the day before I went to get the car, the sales person told me they sold the one I wanted but had a different one a tier above the one I was looking at. He said they would price match the SR to the SV. I don’t think they price matched. 

The anxiety has been eating me up. There’s been tells about loans garnishes wages and income driven plans no longer being a thing. I’m 25. I won’t stop paying this car until I’m 30-31. 

I called the dealership today to see what my options are and hoping we can figure something out.  

If anything, would I be able to refinance in the future?

I just wish I could reverse everything and get my old car back :/ 

I would appreciate any kind words and advice. Thank you in advance!

1k8psf6,Rent or Buy? Overwhelmed by expensive housing market,"My fiance (26M) and I (26F) live in the south Chicago suburbs, currently with our respective families rent free (I know, blessed). We were planning on getting married and moving in together in about 18 months, but the costs of housing around us feels SO expensive and I'm starting to get really overwhelmed just thinking about it.

His parents are kicking him out of their house now so he's thinking of just renting a cheap apartment for a year or so until we get married. At which point we don't know whether we should rent or buy.

The cheapest places we've found that are within commutable distance to his job/me are about $1600/month, and they're not in great areas and don't include dishwashers, laundry facilities, or parking garages for his car. It's fine for him for now, but I feel like it's such a waste of money to spend for some dingy property we don't even own.

His job is a bit unstable at the moment since he's working a temporary contract position. We'll probably know more by the end of the year if he gets hired on full time or needs to move again for work, so that will influence what we want to do in the future.

I like the idea of putting money toward a property that we own, but starter homes in this area are around $350-400K and a lot of them need significant maintenance and updating work that neither he nor I are equipped to handle ourselves. I want to move out of state (I hear Indiana is better property tax-wise), but right now we're kind of tied to his job. I work remotely so it's not an issue for me.

For reference, he makes about 80K a year and I make $70K (pre-taxes).

Moving out of my parents home is looking REALLY disappointing based on the types of properties available for rent/buy around here and they're all SO EXPENSIVE. I talked to my parents about this and they're fine with me staying as long as I need to, so long as I keep contributing to bills and household things like food, cleaning, etc. My fiance and I get along well with my family.

1k7v1zt,Selling our house and might be sitting on the proceeds for awhile,"A local government body is likely going to be purchasing our home in the next few weeks.  It's been a long process, no eminent domain or anything but the timing is almost perfect as we are soon-to-be-empty-nesters and would probably be looking for a new place anyways in the next few years.

The terms are, we'll get cash at closing, they own the property but will lease it back to us for $1/year for **two years** while they finalize planning for their project.  So, basically we get to live here for two years for free while searching for a new home.

We'll be getting around $700k in cash at closing - my question is, what to do with it?  We'll be house-hunting soon and could find something in a month or it might take a year, or we may end up just building, not sure yet.

1k5hdwv,Forcing a Bank to Close a Card,"This is an oddball situation.

In the 2010s, I had a credit card with a local credit union. Around 2017 or so, after not using it for a while, I went to use it and the card didn't work. I asked the credit union and they said they closed it due to inactivity. 

That said, the card continues to show on my credit report as open. I've contacted the bank and they said it's closed, but nothing changes on my credit report.

In 2024, I filed a dispute through Equifax and the credit union replied that the card is open. 

I went to the bank to dispute the dispute, and the branch agent looked me up and said that there are nothing in the system to show me having an active credit card. She promised to look into it, which she never did, and I kind of knew she was going to throw it away when she said ""It doesn't really matter, it's good for your credit report."" 

Last month I sent a demand letter to the credit union demanding they investigate this card and either A.) If the card is actually open, reinstate my account and give me a new card or B.) Accurately report to the Equifax, Transunion and Experian that the card is closed, paid as agreed.

So far, crickets from the credit union. 

I'm honestly at a loss. I live in Maryland, I have looked into a lawsuit against the bank, but my research has been unclear on if you can actually sue a bank to force them to close an account. 

It does matter because I like to do credit card rewards and points, and I essentially have a card with 12,000 dollars in open credit on my report, adding to the total amount of open credit I have.

I went to the bank to dispute the dispute, and the branch agent looked me up and said that there are nothing in the system to show me having an active credit card. She promised to look into it, which she never did, and I kind of knew she was going to throw it away when she said ""It doesn't really matter, it's good for your credit report."" 

Last month I sent a demand letter to the credit union demanding they investigate this card and either A.) If the card is actually open, reinstate my account and give me a new card or B.) Accurately report to the Equifax, Transunion and Experian that the card is closed, paid as agreed.

So far, crickets from the credit union. 

I'm honestly at a loss. I live in Maryland, I have looked into a lawsuit against the bank, but my research has been unclear on if you can actually sue a bank to force them to close an account. 

It does matter because I like to do credit card rewards and points, and I essentially have a card with 12,000 dollars in open credit on my report, adding to the total amount of open credit I have. 

",forcing a bank to close a card this is an oddball situation in the s i had a credit card with a local credit union around or so after not using it for a while i went to use it and the card didnt work i asked the credit union and they said they closed it due to inactivity that said the card continues to show on my credit report as open ive contacted the bank and they said its closed but nothing changes on my credit report in i filed a dispute through equifax and the credit union replied that the card is open i went to the bank to dispute the dispute and the branch agent looked me up and said that there are nothing in the system to show me having an active credit card she promised to look into it which she never did and i kind of knew she was going to throw it away when she said it doesnt really matter its good for your credit report last month i sent a demand letter to the credit union demanding they investigate this card and either a if the card is actually open reinstate my account and give me a new card or b accurately report to the equifax transunion and experian that the card is closed paid as agreed so far crickets from the credit union im honestly at a loss i live in maryland i have looked into a lawsuit against the bank but my research has been unclear on if you can actually sue a bank to force them to close an account it does matter because i like to do credit card rewards and points and i essentially have a card with dollars in open credit on my report adding to the total amount of open credit i have,"credit, card, bank, union, said",2025-04-22 20:58:19

It is the reason I got into trouble with the card in the first place since I haven't been able to work full time for a while now.

I explained this to the court and expected to still have to pay something but hoping to not have to pay all of it.

1k9lkt1,Desperately need tips for my 70 yr old mother…,"Details: 
- 70 years old
- Zero savings (a messy divorce, years of bad financial decision making, and just some terrible luck). Regardless, she works her butt off and I’m really proud of how far she’s come in the last 15-20 years. 
- Zero debt (thank god)
- Just paid off her house (worth about $200k). 
- Gets $2k monthly in Social Security
- Still works full time (owns her own business where she can work from home, and decides how little or frequently she’d like to work). 
- She does as much work as she’s mentally/physically able to. Although, she won’t be able to keep up this pace for that much longer. 
- Now that her mortgage is paid off, she’s going to aim to live off her SS (pretty much covers bills and minimal basic needs) but I’m thinking she’ll need to dip into her income a little bit. 
- After taxes, business expenses, etc. she will probably bring in $50k each year (and I’m thinking she can realistically work for the next 3ish years). 
- After “retirement”, the absolute worst case scenario is that she can solely live off of SS (but it’s VERY risky obviously and doesn’t include any emergencies or any sort of “extra” things in life). 

Support Needed:
- Let’s say she can save $150k over the next 3 years, what is the best course of action? 
- I was thinking keeping everything in a HYSA and don’t touch it unless absolutely necessary? (Thinking stocks are too risky at this age but I could be wrong).

I just want to support her in planning as best as possible so she can have a decent quality of life and doesn’t have to work until she dies. My family does not have the space to have her live with us (nor do I think that’d be best for my mental health and wellbeing).  There’s no other family members that are able to help.

1k5r6pv,Advice on selling home under market value,"Hi everyone! I need opinions because I’m unsure on what to do. Backstory: Our house is currently sandwiched between squatters on one side and a neighbor that blasts music basically all day on the other. Surprisingly, the squatters are pretty quiet but it’s obvious that the house is rundown… it even has a visible red tag from the city but the squatters are still there. 

We want to sell and move out of state. We got an offer for about $70k below what the market value of our home is. However, if we take this offer, we still make enough to pay off our current mortgage, our cars, and have enough for at least a 30% down payment on a home in the area we’re looking to move. 

I guess I’m looking for advice on what to do… or what would you do if you were us. The thought of putting our house for sale and having to deal with my disrespectful neighbor while we’re trying to show it just gives me anxiety. There is no talking to the loud neighbor asking them to chill while we’re showing… we tried to ask them to turn the music down before and it almost turned into a physical altercation and a window on our house ended up broken. Tried calling police several times and they sadly do not care. 

I know $70k is a lot of potential money lost but I’m thinking it’s the best decision for my mental health. I know people will think we’re dumb for even considering this lowball offer but my kids hate it here and it’s really impacting me. 

Also our house isn’t in horrible shape but I’m sure it will need some repairs once an inspection is done and we definitely cannot afford it. Which is another reason why we’re considering the cash offer.

Sadly, this car payment is destroying me; it is 770 a month, and I can barely make that. My budget is already razor thin for error, leaving me no real room to save or cover an emergency. I am dumb and bought a car way beyond what I could afford. However, I am trying to get out from under a bit. I understand that the 10k is gone, and probably another 3-4 from the deprecation on the Camry. However, due to my uncertainty about making my payments, I am considering selling the Camry; I have offers from dealers around the 27- 30k. This means I would need to cover around 13k of negative equity.

I am employed at a bank (ironic) and spoke to a loan officer; I could get about a 20k personal loan (unsecured) at an 8.5% interest rate for 60 months. I want to sell the car, use the loan to pay the difference, and take the remaining money to buy an older, used Toyota. I'm looking at some older gens with around 100k miles for 4- 6k. I still will be underwater, but I can make that monthly payment much easier and with much more confidence. I do not want to ruin my credit by failing to pay for this car if SHTF.

Is this an insane decision? Am I better off just paying the Camry and hoping I don't default and can get a better job?

1k9kbv0,Having issues with spending money after growing up relatively poor,"I turned 24 a few weeks back, just got my first job in IT and am still living with my parents. The job market around graduation was tough + a contractor(parents tried to sue, contractor had no insurance) situation that happened prevented us from moving. 

My Roth is half maxed for the year, my only expenses are car, gas, and food once a week with my girlfriend. This totals to around 1100 a month. I make 3-3.2k a month post tax, and save around 1900-2.2k roughly. 

So, 3500 in Roth, 7000 in HYSA, 1000 in checking, 500 in a small s&p500 options webull account that I've gotten to from $100 originally. 

My girlfriend has been fortunate enough to take a lot of vacations with her family and is not hesitant spending money to have valuable experiences. However, I am completely content coming home and reading or playing video games with my friends every day. She wants to go out and do things, like $500 for an airbnb in the mountains near memorial Day weekend, and I shudder at that amount.

I grew up moving a lot and sometimes fairly poor and it never bothered me, but now I feel uncomfortable sometimes even buying food if I'm not using the app coupons. I dislike when other people pay for my things, and I really dislike going out because it always means $$$. Is this normal for a 24 year old? If not, I'm assuming I'm doing a pretty good job saving 2/3 of what I make, could be more in a few months when I move up (think 4k a month saved instead of 2) but I still feel like I'm falling behind.

1k696q2,How do you think about 529 contributions?,"This may be a dumb question, but as I just welcomed my 2nd child, I have 529s on the brain. 

I was incredibly fortunate to graduate from college with no debt, as my parents footed the whole bill. I went to a small, private liberal arts college and that experience was transformational for me. I would like  to be able to offer my children this same opportunity, should it interest them as well. 

I started a 529 when my 1st child was born, and she turns 3 in a few months. It currently has $50K in it and I contribute $600 a month. Per ChatGPT, this projects to be roughly $360K by 2041. This is an odd landing spot as it's well above what public education is projected to cost ($175,000) but well below what private 4 year colleges are expected to ($500,000 - sidebar, WTF?!?!? I do quite well and still find this number insane to even think about). I do not expect that my children will qualify for any need-based aid, so I am assume if she goes to a private college, we will be on the hook for the full monty. 

So, my question I guess is do most folks (who can afford to do so) try and establish a contribution schedule that will result in their 529 plan equalling full projected tuition by the time their kid is in college? Is there a conventional wisdom here?

1k9fxy0,Should I pay my student loans in full?,"I just turned 27 and have next to no financial literacy. My parents never talked about money and it wasn't an option throughout my schooling. As a result I have a lot of anxiety around money and financial decisions.

I currently have $20,104 in 5 individual federal student loans ranging between 3 and 5.5% interest. I was enrolled in the SAVE plan and had zero payment and no interest accruing. My loans were then automatically put into forbearance which I don't understand but as far as I'm concerned I still don't have a payment or interest so it's fine? 

I'm assuming at some point I'll have to start paying my loans. When that happens I'm curious as to whether I should pay it all at once or chunk it. I currently have about $25,000 in my bank account. I live with my parents and have less than $1,000/month in expenses. I currently make about $2,200 a month but my income varies throughout the year and I'm going into my lower-income season. 

If I pay all my loans at once I'll have that weight off my chest, but it'll send me virtually back to zero. On the other hand, if I chunk the payments (say pay one loan off at a time), I'll still have some financial comfort, but I'll be losing money to interest.

1k5r0vl,Save ~$300 a year - Only contribute to your HSA through payroll deductions,"
- HSA contributions made through payroll deduction are exempt from FICA taxes (Social Security and Medicare taxes), saving you 7.65% (6.2% Social Security + 1.45% Medicare)

- HSA contributions made outside of payroll still give you income tax benefits but do NOT provide any FICA tax savings

This is a meaningful difference. For example, on a $3,850 individual HSA contribution (2024 limit), the FICA tax savings through payroll deduction would be about $294.

1k5axw2,Pension at 54 is it worth it.,"Hi all.   Love reading this Reddit.

As the title says I’m nearly 54 and have no pension.   Years of drinking and class As took all my money up.   I’m nearly 2 years sober now and am finally debt free with some savings.

I’m self employed and earn approx £40 to £45k a year.   Currently renting but will be moving.    I’m very fortunate to have met a woman who is financial stable.    Later this year we will be buying together with a large deposit and have a ten year mortgage.   I’ll be paying this to cover my half.     I’m hoping to pay £400 Into a SIPP, which with the tax relief will be £500.

I know this won’t be a great amount but I suppose something is better than nothing.     Is it actually worth me doing this or would it be better to buy to let?     My business is slowly expanding and could over pay the mortgage to get it down quicker.

Any advice on a better way forward would be helpful.",1745340028.0,11,6,/r/personalfinance/comments/1k5axw2/pension_at_54_is_it_worth_it/,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1k5axw2/pension_at_54_is_it_worth_it/,Spen1971,personalfinance,0.73,True,False,False,False,0,1745837062.895442,Finance & Business,7,171,172,Tuesday,12,April,2025,False,0.9777,0.196,0.074,0.729,positive,Pension at 54 is it worth it.,"Hi all.

1k9kxru,Received notice that collections agency will not collect on behalf of my university anymore.,"I'm going to try my best to explain this because it's messy and it has been about a decade, so my details are a tad bit fuzzy. I can clarify anything if needed. TL;DR at the bottom.

I am 32 years old. Back in 2013, I attended university for a semester. I cant remember why, but I had to leave that semester and I think it was tuition related because I had an issue with my student loans. I left the issue to my dad because he said he would help me take care of it. I wound up with a balance that I owed directly to my university for around $10,000 that I didn't know about until receiving a letter from a collections agency and after having my wages garnished.

Cue me sending $25 a month to this agency for the last 10 years. At the time when I got the letter from the agency I panicked and agreed to pay the balance on the advice of my mother who honestly didn't know what to even say or do to help me at the time. Unfortunately, interest cause the debt to jump to about $15,000. I tried adding additional money to the balance to get it down, but the pandemic rolled around and I was laid off. As of March this year the balance is still at $15,000.

Today, I got a letter in the mail that was mailed out on 04/21 that says effective 05/01 they will not longer be collecting on the debt and any unpaid balances have to go through my university. I'm contacting my university tomorrow to see what my options are but I figured I would pop here first for some advice and some guidance on how to proceed.

General info: I work for a university and make 20 an hour. The only debt I have is a car payment for $350 a month and this looming balance. 

ETA: I also want to add that strangely, this entire thing hasn't affected my credit score. It's never popped up on my credit report.

1k9dg8p,Liquidate stocks to fund closing costs on new home?,"Background, my wife and I are currently under contract buying our second home which we see ourselves expanding our family in for decades from now.  Have a little one already.  

My intention is to put 20% down on a 340k home in order to reduce my monthly payment as much as possible and AVOID PMI.  I’m able to put 20% down as a result of the sale of the home we currently live in.  I have a secure job and there’s more money to be made as my career progresses, however, I’m scratching my head right now trying to figure out how to cover all the ancillary closing costs.  With title fees, prepaid insurance, lender fees, homeowners insurance, and so forth I am looking at a whopping $12k in closing costs.  This is the # my lender arrived at after I negotiated with the seller to cover $5k of the original closing cost amount.    

I’ve already paid our earnest money, inspection costs, and the rest of the closing costs are still up in the air.  Right now, I have $7k liquid cash I can apply towards closing but the other $5k is money I don’t have immediately at my disposal.  I was wondering if it would be smart to go forward with any of the options below:

1.  Put 10% or 15% down instead to free myself up and have a cushion following the move and replenish what I lost from closing.
2. Stick with current plan of 20% down and liquidate $6k worth of stocks to fund the remaining balance of closing costs I’d owe after taking into account the $7k.  
3. 10%-15% down and liquidate stocks to cover everything and still have a fall back.

I know it’s not a lot of money but we don’t want to throw it away and RTC fees are ridiculous.  He already has a Roth with vanguard.  Most funds seem to have a $1000 minimum at vanguard so he can’t just roll it into another pretax fund. Are there good funds that have no minimum?

1k619ke,Should I sell my house now or rent it out for a few years?,"
I’m trying to decide between selling my house now or renting it out for a few years before selling, and I’d love some outside perspective.
The house is in California, worth about $670k. I owe around $490k on the mortgage and currently pay $3,100/month. I can get that down to $2,950 by removing my mortgage insurance. I could probably rent it for $3,200/month, but after management, maintenance, and vacancy costs, I’d actually lose about $125/month in cash flow.

I’m trying to decide between selling my house now or renting it out for a few years before selling, and I’d love some outside perspective.
The house is in California, worth about $670k. I owe around $490k on the mortgage and currently pay $3,100/month. I can get that down to $2,950 by removing my mortgage insurance. I could probably rent it for $3,200/month, but after management, maintenance, and vacancy costs, I’d actually lose about $125/month in cash flow. I'd also need to put in around $15k for fencing and minor fixes to make it rental-ready.

1k8yhds,Advice for a 22 year old.,"I'm a 22 year old male living alone in Australia 

So basically I wanted to know your opinion on my plan that I kinda created when I was 21.
I grew up in a poor family in Estonia and it's still very much like it. So when I turned 21 and had finally saved enough money to go to Australia like I always wanted. I've been here in Australia for about 8 months and I've managed to save about 18000 euro. I don't like to spend a penny on me because how I grew up.

My plan is to save enough money to buy my moms apartment that my sibling took as a loan so my mom could have a place to live and we wouldn't have to worry, to buy it right out it would be im guessing about 80-90k euro.

I'm very very motivated to achieve that goal in the next 4 years if everything goes well here which I think it will. 

I'm just wondering if it's a smart idea to do or what's ur guys opinion on it. What should I do with the money while I'm collecting it for a couple of years, it's just sitting in my bank with a 2% annual return which I can always use as well. I really don't care about having money so I just wanna help my mom first and then focus on myself if needed.

1k7o5db,Am I ready financially to quit my job and be a SAHD?,"So I (32M) currently work an engineering job making about 125k salary, and my wife (34F) works in another field bringing in about 80k salary. We are expecting a baby in October. 

Work has been pretty detrimental to my mental health, and my wife and I have talked about me potentially taking the opportunity to take a break from work and be a SAHD.  I have been recommended by a friends, family, and a few healthcare professionals to quit because it's gotten pretty bad. I am at the point where I have nearly exhausted all FMLA, PTO and short term disability benefits.

I have been getting professional help from both therapy and medication for 2+ years now.

So after crunching some numbers and assessing our budget, I think my wife should break even with our spending and how much she takes home monthly. Likely have some leftover, but to be safe we are going to assume a complete breakeven. This is still taking into account part of her paycheck going into her 401k to get her company match. And also new expenses going towards the baby.

Here is a rough breakdown of my personal financial scenario:

Only debt is our mortgage with 178k remaining. We saved pretty aggressively and payed off more than half the house and recast to get our monthly payment down to only about $1540 on a 400k house since getting it in 2022. 5% mortgage rate.

180k in a HYSA.

65k across various brokerage accounts.

50k in money market account ready to be invested, but still liquid as of right now.

170k 401k invested.

25k HSA, about 23k invested and 2k liquid.

45k Roth IRA invested.

Investments have taken a bit of a hit with the recent market changes, but these were intended to be pretty long term investments.

I'm worried about a few things:

Although we did some budgeting, I am still concerned of bleeding money due to some unforseen regular expenses down the road (especially with a newborn), increased premiums for health/house/car insurances, inflation, etc.

I'm also concerned how this gap will affect my career in the long run. I am wondering if this is career suicide? I'm really concerned that I'll be set back a few years and have to take a demotion whenever I do re-enter the work force. I worked really hard the last 8 years to move up the ladder and am worried I'm throwing all that away. I know it's common for women to quit and be a SAHM, so there may be more sympathy when trying to re-enter the workforce later. I am not sure how it will be received re-entering as a SAHD.

Assuming I couldn't find a job again, do I have enough to retire living relatively frugally? If not how long could it last me? As of right now I can technically can pay off my mortgage completely with my savings, have 50k left in savings, and then just let my investment accounts continue to compound for the next 30 years. My wife could comfortably afford our monthly expenses and have more for savings, and then allow all that to grow on her end. I just personally feel more comfortable keeping a larger emergency fund right now until things play out more once the baby gets here. Also I'm torn between investing that in the market vs a guaranteed 5% return paying off the house. 

Assuming we stay in our house forever, could I in theory be set up for retirement assuming my wife keeps working? This is a ""just in case"" scenario. I would definitely want to get back into the workforce eventually, but want to assess how close I am to retirement/FIRE. I am also scared of not being able to find good work again with how tough the job market is right now, especially in my field.

Some less financially driven factors I have been weighing:

We don't have family that would be able to care for the baby near us, so the only options would be to either pay for childcare, or one of us quits to be a stay at home parent. We would also feel more comfortable if one of raised our child rather than trust that to strangers. 

I also wanted to take the time to brush up on my mandarin. It's something I always wanted to do, but never had the time or energy because of work. I also wanted to raise my child bilingual like I was, but I know my mandarin has gotten worse over the years. So I think it would be a mutually beneficial endeavor for both the child and myself.

I also wanted to take the time to potentially assess a career change. I went into engineering, not because it was a passion, but because I was decent at it and I knew it would pay well. I'm not sure what else it is I want to pursue professionally. Part of keeping that savings around is if I do find something that I'm passionate about, whether that be a project/business/further education, I have some means to pursue that.

Part of me wanted to quit months ago to enjoy these last few months of being childless (not that I'm not excitied to have a child). Maybe take time to travel as well even if it means burning through some savings. I keep holding on to this job because I hear about how rough the job market is right now, and the uncertainty of the economy with the trade wars and other stuff going on in the world. 

My apologies for the long post. I'm very torn right now between quitting my job and preparing to be a stay at home parent, or staying at it despite it being detrimental to my mental health, but offering more stability in a somewhat spooky economy. Any thoughts/advice would be greatly appreciated. 

Edit: It's funny how different and conflicting reddit opinions can be. In another post on another account on a mental health subreddit, it was a unanimous ""you should quit yesterday"". Here it's ""you're not ready to quit, don't it"". So yeah I'm conflicted and at my ropes end despite getting all the professional mental health help. But after reading a lot of the comments here, it very much reinforced the idea that if I don't earn enough money I might as well be dead.

1k5hptu,Need advice on how to live/think rich,"Hey, looking for advice from this sub on the right places to start to change how I manage and deal with money.

Some background: I'm a 45 year old male, married with kids. I grew up pretty poor, so never had really anything growing up, or any money mentors. Over the past 15 years I've started and grown a landscape maintenance company, to the point that this year I am able to just manage contracts, I don't do any physical work. While the company has debt and payments, I personally don't have really any debt to speak of. Our house is paid off completely, our 3 vehicles are likewise completely paid off.

Here's the rub. I don't feel like we're anywhere close to being above paycheque to paycheque, even though we are. I've got excess personal money (110k) that sits in accounts and isn't doing anything. I understand the concept of compound interest, but haven't done anything to invest my money. While I don't spend money just for the hell of it, I am also not thrifty. I have a decently nonchalant view towards money, and I understand that that view, while not holding me back, is hampering my ability to relax and retire down the road. It boils down to not having any education in money, no role models in money, and no idea what to do with it.

I've got a mantra for work that guides a lot of my decisions. ""What would a million dollar company do?"" So when I'm trying to decide advertising strategies, equipment purchases, even clothing for my crews, that statement helps guide me. My problem is financially, I have no f\*%king idea what a millionaire would do in my spot, with my money.

I realize that I'm in a fortunate position, and do not take that for granted. I've worked really hard to get here, and caught a lot of breaks, which I capitalized on. But what I'm looking for is advice on what to do next.

1k6xo1z,Trying to decide whether it makes sense to sell or keep first home.,"My spouse and I currently live in Atlanta. We have a home that was purchased in 2022 for 422,500 at 3.75%. We owe 377,000 left on that loan. We very likely will be moving to Athens Georgia where there is a lower cost of living. We are trying to determine whether it makes more sense to: 1) rent in Athens for a few years and save for a new down payment and keep this home as a rental property or 2) sell this house immediately (estimated around 460k) and spend that on a house in Athens. Alternative strategies are also welcome. We know Athens very well so we feel comfortable purchasing straight away if needed.

One big reason to keep the property is that there is a large mixed use mall development and walking trail (like the beltline) that is being built in the neighborhood. So in two years the renter / owner of the space would be able to walk to shops and movie theatres from our home very easily. This makes me think the expected equity in the home will jump dramatically in that time.

1k59a4r,Pre-Tax 401K in order to negate capital gains tax?,"After deductions, my and my spouse's combined income is ~$105,000. I have about $9200 of long term capital gains that, on top of the $105,000, would be taxed at 15% (amount owed would be about $1400).

I'm aggressive about maxing my 401k and IRA(s) and we've already maxed our Roth IRA(s) and can still contribute ~$15,000 to a 401k; right now, this is a Roth 401k, but *could* be moved to traditional / pretax.

If I dump the rest of the 401k into pre-tax, this reduces our combined taxable income to $90,000, and that would then make ~half the long term gains taxed at 0%, and we'd owe about half of what we're currently owing (ie saves us $700 in taxes on capital gains). Is this correct? 

Second question: my wife is currently job hunting and if she acquires a job that results in >$5,000 gross by end of year, then this doesn't really do anything because we won't be able to get below the $94,000 taxable income to get zero capital gains.

Luckily I don’t use this account anymore so hardly any funds were locked but I do have several other accounts with the same bank that arent effected.

Here’s my worry.. I pay for my car thru a lien under this parents name because I bought the car from them and they had a favorable interest rate that I wouldnt have been able to get..

The car will be paid off this summer and I was hoping to have the title transferred to my name then…. having found out about this personal debt judgement and levy I worry that my car can be taken because its not technically under my name.

I have proof of bank transfers, spreadsheets of payments etc showing that I’ve paid for the car if that helps.

1k8hp9i,Good or bad purchase?,"I’m a 24M and currently make $90k/year. I live very frugally, save about 20% of my income, and have a $10k emergency fund. My biggest expense is my $60k of student loans, and I’m paying $1,400/month toward them on an aggressive payoff plan. Even with that, I still manage to save a good amount each month. 

My hobby is working on and fixing cars, and I’ve been itching for months to buy a 1995 Mazda Miata as a fun toy car. It would cost around $7k–$8k. I already have a paid-off daily driver that's about 20 years old, so the Miata would purely be a weekend/fixer-upper toy. I enjoy working on cars, so some issues don't bother me.

The thing is my now wife (dating for 4 years prior) leans toward saving for a house instead, which obviously makes a lot of sense long-term. I agree it’s a bigger priority, but I’m also really tempted because I know how much enjoyment (and mechanical experience) the Miata would bring.

Would buying the Miata be a dumb move financially given my situation, or does it seem reasonable?

1k7wjjn,Advice on what is best/most realistic for my living situation,"Hello all,

Looking for advice on what is best/most realistic for my living situation.

* Background:
   * 27yo, Recently graduated August 2024, making roughly 85k before taxes, contributing 12% to retirement accounts with 6% employer match leaving me with about $4000 per month after taxes and contributions.
      * 6% traditional and 6% Roth with employer contribution going to Roth
   * Currently living at home with family so no rent and not really having to contribute to groceries, and such which I am super blessed with
   * I did have bad spending habits earlier in life and did live as a broke grad student for a couple of years (hence the loans and CC debt) but that experience was really valuable for the importance of managing my finances.
* Goal: Buy a house in Charlotte, NC within 2 years
* Debts:
   * credit cards
      * $1,000 at 0% interest for for 15months (paying 70/month to have it paid off within promotional period)
      * $2500 1.99% interest until November (planning on paying 200-350/month to have it paid off within promotional period)
   * Student loans:
      * $11,600 at about 6%
   * **TOTAL:**
      * **$15,100**
   * just finished paying off 11,000 on a high interest discover CC and planning on tackling these debts next
* Savings:
   * Retirement has a bit over $6,000 and gets about $900 per month in it currently
   * Have an individual account with Fidelity that I have $100 in it but not sure whether to start contributing to that or HYSA for my goals
   * Otherwise, none really. I was super focused on paying off high interest debts (discover had 11,000 25% interest) since starting work which I finally did 2 weeks ago
   * Planning on opening HYSA and putting in 2000-2500/month
* Credit score: 740ish
* Monthly Expenses
   * Live at home so not having to pay rent, minimal on groceries
   * Groceries: 100ish/month but mostly on meal prep things for work, can probably minimize this and get creative w the groceries at home since i don’t really need to contribute
   * Transportation:
      * Car paid off
      * 60-80 on gas
   * Phone: 25
   * Gym: 15
   * Dining & entertainment: Variable but around 300 max i would say
   * **TOTAL: $520 but lots of these can be cut down or are not necessities**
* Monthly Income: expenses
   * $4000 income
      * subtract 520 in expenses excluding debt
      * subtract 720 from paying off debt
      * 4000-1250 = 2750
      * put 2500 in HYSA per month for housing fund

The house in Charlotte are currently around 350k for new build 3-4 bed 2.5 bath which is what I would be aiming for, but I’m not sure I anticipate my income going up that much past 85k in that period of time to afford that expensive of a house. I am currently single income but hopeful I find a partner in the next few years lol. There are some properties going for around 250k but they seem to need lots of fixing up.

Is being able to afford a mortgage within 12 months with this plan realistic or do I need to tailor expectations some and save for longer? It would be ok from a familial perspective to stay at home for as long as I need to, but as a 27yo, emotionally I am ready to “start my life” and be on my own.

1k6xlu4,Best route to getting my finances together as a young adult,"Hello!  
I'm currently 22 and 1 year away from graduating college. I live with my mom and sister, and the most that she asks of me is to help with paying some groceries and to pay my part of the car insurance ($120) per month.  
FAFSA has covered me in terms of class payments, so I am not in student debt.  
  
However, I only work a part time job as a computer repair technician, which is very flexible with my school schedule, but not enough money per month to quickly get me out of debt. I work roughly 22-24 hours a week and get paid $20/hr. I get paid bi-weekly.   
  
I have 2 credit cards (I did a balance transfer initially), with one card at around $3.5k in debt and the other one at around $1.5k in debt. The smaller debt one doesn't have interest until next year. Currently, I am having trouble paying more than the minimum payment. It seems like a pattern that, if I try to pay what I think is appropriate each paycheck ($150-200 per card), I end up getting low on money by the second week and end up using the credit card that I just paid off, leading me to square one with the same debt. 

I have tried making excel sheets analyzing every purchase I have made each month vs the money I bring in, and it is apparent that I am spending a few hundred more than I make. My usual purchases include grocery visits, gas, tolls, and eating out sometimes. especially Mondays where I have 2 back to back 5 hour classes and I live an hour from campus so I have to eat something nearby. Some big purchases that have really weighed down my card was a surprise flat tire, new piano (old piano speakers stopped working, too old to repair), laptop for school, monitor, dental work/doctor vists. etc.

I would like to get myself to $500 or less on each credit card by Spring next year, when I graduate, and I feel like that might be a realistic goal as it would be roughly $170/month per card ($85 biweekly), not including interest so roughly more.

I'm currently 22 and 1 year away from graduating college. I live with my mom and sister, and the most that she asks of me is to help with paying some groceries and to pay my part of the car insurance ($120) per month.  
FAFSA has covered me in terms of class payments, so I am not in student debt.  
  
However, I only work a part time job as a computer repair technician, which is very flexible with my school schedule, but not enough money per month to quickly get me out of debt. I work roughly 22-24 hours a week and get paid $20/hr. I get paid bi-weekly.   
  
I have 2 credit cards (I did a balance transfer initially), with one card at around $3.5k in debt and the other one at around $1.5k in debt. The smaller debt one doesn't have interest until next year. Currently, I am having trouble paying more than the minimum payment. It seems like a pattern that, if I try to pay what I think is appropriate each paycheck ($150-200 per card), I end up getting low on money by the second week and end up using the credit card that I just paid off, leading me to square one with the same debt. 

I have tried making excel sheets analyzing every purchase I have made each month vs the money I bring in, and it is apparent that I am spending a few hundred more than I make. My usual purchases include grocery visits, gas, tolls, and eating out sometimes. especially Mondays where I have 2 back to back 5 hour classes and I live an hour from campus so I have to eat something nearby. Some big purchases that have really weighed down my card was a surprise flat tire, new piano (old piano speakers stopped working, too old to repair), laptop for school, monitor, dental work/doctor vists. etc.

I would like to get myself to $500 or less on each credit card by Spring next year, when I graduate, and I feel like that might be a realistic goal as it would be roughly $170/month per card ($85 biweekly), not including interest so roughly more. However, I would like advice on whether this is a good idea, or if there are other suggestions and advise for saving money.

1k68al6,Stuck in a financial hole and don’t know how to dig out. Any advice?,"A few months ago, I left a draining job and took a risk on a new sales position. It hasn’t paid off yet the way I hoped, and now the financial hole I was in is catching up to me fast.

I’ve been living very frugally—more than I ever have before—but things are spiraling.

Last month, I couldn’t afford rent, so I asked my landlord if I could double up and pay both months this month. That was a mistake—I still don’t have enough. I owe them $2,250 for the two rents.

On top of that, I missed a car insurance payment ($648), and now my car has been towed because I got pulled over for driving uninsured. It’s $175 to retrieve it, plus $37 per day it sits in the impound. I likely won’t be able to pay that today either.

I looked into new insurance providers and the cheapest I found was $408/month, but I assume I’ll have to pay off the balance with my previous provider before switching.

I don’t have family I can lean on—my dad isn’t willing to help and my mom just doesn’t have the means. I’ve been working this sales job for about six weeks. I haven’t found success yet, but I still believe I can.

Problem is, I can’t work without a car. I’ve tried to get a loan, but my credit is 685 and my short employment history seems to be holding me back.

I feel like I’m running out of options and time. I just need a way to stabilize things and get back to work, but I don’t know where to turn. Any advice or guidance would mean the world.

1k63fp2,"For those without a house at this point, what are you doing to hopefully buy in the future?","Everytime I revisit this issue I want to crash out mentally, so I need some form of constructive advice if any exists. 

This is especially hard to deal with because I 32F did own a home with my now ex until 2022. We bought a new construction in 2019 for $159k. Unfortunately the split was sudden and not mutual (he was the one that left). I couldn’t afford to refinance the house to pay him his part of the equity and he flat out didn’t understand why he would owe me that, so we sold it for $250k. After commission to the realtors we walked with about $38k each, and  after various expenses I had to pay off I’ve been sitting at $27k the last year now. $27k is nothing to be ungrateful for, very few people end up in that situation after owning a house for a mere 3 years but I knew owning again was going to be extremely difficult. It’s just hard mentally knowing I HAD a house with an insanely low mortgage, and I had no choice but to let it go. 


Anyway time to put away the violin. At this point I make close to $50k a year gross (I sell insurance so I make a combo of base and commission, that’s why it’s a little bit of a guesstimate). This last raise in March is the only reason I have a little money left at the end of the month lately, however I anticipate my health insurance to go up by about $170 a month next year given that they do not expand the subsides set to expire in 2026. My lease renews in November so I’m not sure how much that will increase. The good news is I’ve opted to pull $150 more a month out of my checks for taxes so if I lose my subsides, I’ll just stop paying the extra to offset that. 


I do put my money into CDs and am transitioning to high yield savings accounts - I don’t like the process of having to make a change within 10 days of maturity with the CDs and the renewal rate keeps sucking. I honestly cannot stomach investing the money into anything risky, because it just feels like a) I’ll never have this much money again and b) I’ll want to crawl in a hole and die if I lost the money to an investment. 


That being said, what are some things you might be doing to try and buy in the future? I don’t believe I will try to buy until probably at least 2028 and see where things are by then. I have great credit that’s at 816 right now. My only debt is my car loan which will be paid off in July 2027 and I have interest of 2.9%, I bought it under MSRP brand new - a 2021 Honda civic, nothing wild. I actually made a $4k profit off my last civic due to the market and put that into this car, so my car payment is $331. Pretty low by today’s standard. No credit card debt, student loans, nothing. I do use credit cards regularly for the points but I spend what I’d spend with cash, so I’m not dipping into my debit and credit I guess you could say. 


My only real option might be to just save as much as I can, keep it all in interest accounts and try to increase my income - which I get healthy raises. I have an insanely generous boss. In 4 years time I’ve been given around $18k in raises on my base and that’s pretty consistent every year, so I’m in a great position as far as that goes. But if there’s something I’m missing or not considering I’d love to hear it. Also I do have retirement I pay 3% into because of my 3% match with my employer. Owning a home quite frankly is the biggest goal I’ve ever had and it is integral to my retirement plan. I suppose worst case hopefully many years away I’ll end up with money from my parents’ estates but that’s not part of any plan. Thanks for any advice. 

**edit to add: It might be worth noting that I live in NC, and you can purchase a good house around $250k.

I’m currently with someone so the idea is if I’m still with him in the next few years, I’d be buying something with him. 

But as far as my income goes, I fall around what’s considered median income.

The average apartment I would say is around $1300 a month depending on the quality in terms of upgraded kitchens, etc. average rental home is $1500-1600.",for those without a house at this point what are you doing to hopefully buy in the future everytime i revisit this issue i want to crash out mentally so i need some form of constructive advice if any exists this is especially hard to deal with because i f did own a home with my now ex until we bought a new construction in for k unfortunately the split was sudden and not mutual he was the one that left i couldnt afford to refinance the house to pay him his part of the equity and he flat out didnt understand why he would owe me that so we sold it for k after commission to the realtors we walked with about k each and after various expenses i had to pay off ive been sitting at k the last year now k is nothing to be ungrateful for very few people end up in that situation after owning a house for a mere years but i knew owning again was going to be extremely difficult its just hard mentally knowing i had a house with an insanely low mortgage and i had no choice but to let it go anyway time to put away the violin at this point i make close to k a year gross i sell insurance so i make a combo of base and commission thats why its a little bit of a guesstimate this last raise in march is the only reason i have a little money left at the end of the month lately however i anticipate my health insurance to go up by about a month next year given that they do not expand the subsides set to expire in my lease renews in november so im not sure how much that will increase the good news is ive opted to pull more a month out of my checks for taxes so if i lose my subsides ill just stop paying the extra to offset that i do put my money into cds and am transitioning to high yield savings accounts i dont like the process of having to make a change within days of maturity with the cds and the renewal rate keeps sucking i honestly cannot stomach investing the money into anything risky because it just feels like a ill never have this much money again and b ill want to crawl in a hole and die if i lost the money to an investment that being said what are some things you might be doing to try and buy in the future i dont believe i will try to buy until probably at least and see where things are by then i have great credit thats at right now my only debt is my car loan which will be paid off in july and i have interest of i bought it under msrp brand new a honda civic nothing wild i actually made a k profit off my last civic due to the market and put that into this car so my car payment is pretty low by todays standard no credit card debt student loans nothing i do use credit cards regularly for the points but i spend what id spend with cash so im not dipping into my debit and credit i guess you could say my only real option might be to just save as much as i can keep it all in interest accounts and try to increase my income which i get healthy raises i have an insanely generous boss in years time ive been given around k in raises on my base and thats pretty consistent every year so im in a great position as far as that goes but if theres something im missing or not considering id love to hear it also i do have retirement i pay into because of my match with my employer owning a home quite frankly is the biggest goal ive ever had and it is integral to my retirement plan i suppose worst case hopefully many years away ill end up with money from my parents estates but thats not part of any plan thanks for any advice edit to add it might be worth noting that i live in nc and you can purchase a good house around k between kk it depends on a few factors but im not living in an area where the average house is something like k im currently with someone so the idea is if im still with him in the next few years id be buying something with him but as far as my income goes i fall around whats considered median income i claimed k last year and i got a raise of k in mid march but i leave room for error depending on what sales look like for me this year for example i live in a good part of my city and my rent is a month for a bedroom apartment the average apartment i would say is around a month depending on the quality in terms of upgraded kitchens etc average rental home is,"year, house, money, month, ive",2025-04-23 16:25:05
1k5tp90,Inheriting a Paid-Off House,"****THE RESPONSES HAVE BEEN OVERWHELMING, WITH MOST BEING HIGHLY CONCERNED ABOUT MY PLAN😅 LOOKS LIKE WE ARE GONNA STAY AWAY FROM ANY TYPE OF BORROWING FOR NOW. thanks everyone!!!

Hi everyone,
I'm hoping to find a bit of guidance regarding a pretty specific financial situation, so please bear with me; I want to hear anything you have to say.

 I'm about to finalize probate on a house inherited from my parents’ estate (both have passed away) and  this house is fully paid off, so my husband and I are trying to figure out the smartest way to use this asset to improve our overall financial situation, while also investing in our new home. 

THE HOUSE: 
single-family craftsman home in Idaho, 4 bedrooms, valued somewhere between $250,000-$300,000. Fully paid off (no mortgage/liens). Deed will be in (my) name very soon— my mom’s debts are fully paid as well, and we are just letting for our lawyer facilitate the legal process necessary to release her estate. We are already living at the property, as we couldn’t afford to maintain both our apartment and the house at the same time. 


CREDIT: 
Score is currently around 600. I'm recovering from past issues - had 5 collections, 4 are now paid off. I’m 25 years old and almost all of that mess is from when I was 18/19/20. I have well 2 well maintained credit cards that I’ve had for almost a year and a $12,000 car loan I’ve been paying on for about 2 years. 

INCOME:
I am married, however only my name is to be on the deed. Our combined income is about $55,000 a year. I only make about $20,000 of that. (don’t forget, I live in rural Idaho so that is fairly average income for here; we are able to cover rent, utilities, etc. and have a little leftover every month.) 

GOALS: 
I would like to renovate a few rooms (husband works in construction, so our cost is only the price of actual supplies— the house is in need of updates), replace the furnace/air conditioner, and pay off the two HIGHLY predatory interest rate car loans that we owe, as well as a very small amount of credit card debt between the two of us, totaling about $13,000. We don’t want to have to take out more than $50,000 total.

My questions: 
With a ~600 credit score, is it realistic to qualify for a Home Equity Loan, HELOC, or a Cash-Out Refinance for ~$50k on a fully paid-off house? What kind of interest rates and terms should we brace ourselves for?

EDIT: my 3 older siblings renounced their share of the estate because they all own homes. Why? because my mom wanted it to stay in the family and also because I’m the only one who doesn’t own a home. My sister is the executor. There’s an unfortunate condition in the legal documentation for this that states I cannot sell for 10 years or else I will have to split the proceeds with all 3 siblings. I don’t want to do that.😅

1k492ir,"Title: Best major for someone passionate about finance/personal finance? (16 y/o from Italy, doing an exchange year in the US next year)","Hi everyone,

I'm a 16-year-old student from Italy and I’ve always been passionate about finance — especially personal finance, investing, and understanding how people and systems manage money. I spend a lot of my free time reading, watching finance content, and learning about markets. I’m 100% sure this is the field I want to work in long-term.

Right now I attend a *Liceo Scientifico*, which is a math-focused high school track here in Italy (pretty rigorous academically, but not business-related). Even though I don’t study finance at school, it’s been a big personal interest for years.

Next year, I’ll be doing a school exchange year in the US. I hope it’ll help me understand more about international options and build a clearer idea of what comes next.

My questions:

* For someone who’s super passionate about personal finance and investing, what’s the best major?
* For someone passionate about personal finance and investing, what is the best major to choose at university? Finance? Economics? Business? Something else?
* What are the main differences between these majors in terms of the things you learn and the jobs they lead to?
* Any advice on how to approach the US college application process as a non-US student?
* Is it better to go for something more general like Business, or more specific like Finance?
* And while I’m open to studying in Italy, I’m also very interested in universities in other European countries or the US — so if you know of good programs or schools that focus on this area, I’d be grateful for any recommendations.

I hope someone with experience in the finance or education world can give me some guidance.

Thanks a lot to anyone who reads this and takes the time to reply.

1k8frli,I have a problem with spending money... help?,"Hello,

I’m not exactly sure what kind of advice I’m hoping for, but I feel like I’m facing a big issue. You might think I’m spending too much by reading the title, but actually, my problem is the opposite, and it’s affecting both my relationship and my enjoyment of life. I was raised in a family where saving money was always a top priority, and now I’m starting to realize that it has affected me too much and that I've gone too far.

Treating myself to something unnecessary is almost unheard of for me. I’ll go out of my way just to save a little bit more, even when it’s probably not worth it. I’ve become so fixated on saving that I kind of hate it, and I feel like it’s starting to impact my relationship. I don’t like who I’ve turned into.

I’m in my early 30s, and recently, my partner and I bought a new apartment together, which nearly doubled my living expenses. We’re splitting the costs (I pay a bit more since I earn more), but it still feels like a quite increase in expenses from my earned money, and I’m struggling to adjust. We talked about the decision before purchasing, but whenever someone asks, “What are you saving all this money for?” I can’t come up with a solid answer. And because I don’t know how to respond, I ended up agreeing to a more expensive apartment than I initially were looking for. As a result i have a increased expense in interest rate and mortgage for the loan.

I have a decent salary compared to others my age, and I used to save around 70% of it, mostly investing in funds and things like that. But now, with the new apartment, I’ll only be saving about 40% instead. I don’t really have any specific goals for my savings, other than wanting to feel financially secure, but at what point will i feel that? I’ve already saved around $120,000, but I still feel this constant urge to save more and avoid spending money.

It feels like I’m being overly frugal to the point where it makes me feel greedy and kind of self-loathing. I even feel like i'm not enjoying life because the main goal is always to save money. I try to tell myself it’s okay to save ""only"" 40% and spend the rest, but when I reflect on it, I just feel like I’m wasting money. Everyone around me says I should try to enjoy life a bit more and spend some of what I’ve earned, but I can never quite convince myself that it’s worth it....

I’m not even sure what I’m hoping to get out of posting this, but… how do I get past this mindset?",1745681883.0,1,23,/r/personalfinance/comments/1k8frli/i_have_a_problem_with_spending_money_help/,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1k8frli/i_have_a_problem_with_spending_money_help/,LifelessBob,personalfinance,0.56,True,False,False,False,0,1745837169.709073,Finance & Business,8,464,468,Saturday,11,April,2025,True,0.9924,0.173,0.094,0.733,positive,I have a problem with spending money... help?,"Hello,

And because I don’t know how to respond, I ended up agreeing to a more expensive apartment than I initially were looking for. As a result i have a increased expense in interest rate and mortgage for the loan.

I have a decent salary compared to others my age, and I used to save around 70% of it, mostly investing in funds and things like that. But now, with the new apartment, I’ll only be saving about 40% instead. I don’t really have any specific goals for my savings, other than wanting to feel financially secure, but at what point will i feel that? I’ve already saved around $120,000, but I still feel this constant urge to save more and avoid spending money.

It feels like I’m being overly frugal to the point where it makes me feel greedy and kind of self-loathing. I even feel like i'm not enjoying life because the main goal is always to save money. I try to tell myself it’s okay to save ""only"" 40% and spend the rest, but when I reflect on it, I just feel like I’m wasting money. Everyone around me says I should try to enjoy life a bit more and spend some of what I’ve earned, but I can never quite convince myself that it’s worth it....

I’m not even sure what I’m hoping to get out of posting this, but… how do I get past this mindset?",i have a problem with spending money help hello im not exactly sure what kind of advice im hoping for but i feel like im facing a big issue you might think im spending too much by reading the title but actually my problem is the opposite and its affecting both my relationship and my enjoyment of life i was raised in a family where saving money was always a top priority and now im starting to realize that it has affected me too much and that ive gone too far treating myself to something unnecessary is almost unheard of for me ill go out of my way just to save a little bit more even when its probably not worth it ive become so fixated on saving that i kind of hate it and i feel like its starting to impact my relationship i dont like who ive turned into im in my early s and recently my partner and i bought a new apartment together which nearly doubled my living expenses were splitting the costs i pay a bit more since i earn more but it still feels like a quite increase in expenses from my earned money and im struggling to adjust we talked about the decision before purchasing but whenever someone asks what are you saving all this money for i cant come up with a solid answer and because i dont know how to respond i ended up agreeing to a more expensive apartment than i initially were looking for as a result i have a increased expense in interest rate and mortgage for the loan i have a decent salary compared to others my age and i used to save around of it mostly investing in funds and things like that but now with the new apartment ill only be saving about instead i dont really have any specific goals for my savings other than wanting to feel financially secure but at what point will i feel that ive already saved around but i still feel this constant urge to save more and avoid spending money it feels like im being overly frugal to the point where it makes me feel greedy and kind of selfloathing i even feel like im not enjoying life because the main goal is always to save money i try to tell myself its okay to save only and spend the rest but when i reflect on it i just feel like im wasting money everyone around me says i should try to enjoy life a bit more and spend some of what ive earned but i can never quite convince myself that its worth it im not even sure what im hoping to get out of posting this but how do i get past this mindset,"feel, like, money, saving, ive",2025-04-26 15:38:03

1k864el,Buy used or lease for 3 years?,"I’m hoping this is the right sub for this apologies if not.

I am in the market for a new car. I’ve looked at buying used and also leasing. I’m completely lost and don’t know what the best choice is. My details below:

Budget for car: $500 a month (all in)
Down payment: $2-6k (depending on whether I’m buying or leasing)
Take home: ~$7k after taxes/month
Leftover after bills/etc: ~$4k (this does not include my monthly savings/investments, which leaves me at around $3-3.5k a month)

I know buy vs. lease is dependent on your end goals, but the math to me ends up coming out about the same? (I’m also bad at math). Is it better to lease a car (I’ve gotten a quote for a Jeep with $4k down and $400 monthly) for 3 years, and in 3 years do this again? Or is it financially smarter to finance a 1-2 year old car (but that means higher $ down and maybe higher payments)? 

Prior to this I drove a paid off 2015 Malibu, so part of me is definitely feeling the itch for something “nice” which is why I’m also struggling with this decision.  Overall, I’m interested in the answer that will save me more money in the long run and that is a smarter (not impulsive) decision.

1k6lcd5,"Started a kayak rental business and scaled it to $30,000 a month","Less than two years ago, I started a kayak rental business with a few old kayaks for $100 each and today have scaled to 28 kayaks in a popular tourist destination. I want to share this success story since I don't have many I can talk to about it and also to inspire you! 

This wasn't my first small business. Started with photography, then pressure washing and window cleaning, then this. Each helped me with the next. Also, all glory to God! 

* **March revenue \~ $40k** 
* **April revenue \~ 30k** 
* **Monthly expenses \~ $5k**

  
Here are few takeaways: 

* **Start small and scale up:** Save as much money as possible and just start! The hardest part is starting and pulling the trigger. Then slowly scale up as it makes sense.
* **Find inspiration:** Research 2-3 of the best businesses doing what you want to do and learn from them. Don't copy and plagiarize but draw inspiration from them.
* **Avoid debt:** But.. take calculated risks when it makes sense (when I decided to purchase 5 new kayaks for 1k each, it was a scary decision but I had already tested the market with my cheap kayaks and knew this would accelerate the business. 
* **Cashflow your expenses when scaling:** Similar to above, save up cash for expenses or large purchases when scaling. If you don't have the money to scale to the degree you want to, maybe you aren't ready yet. 
* **Use common sense and logic:** Think logically and use that to your advantage. I can't imagine not thinking this way with business but maybe it doesn't come naturally for all? Get counsel from others who are successful business owners and pick their brain. 
* **Track finances and set aside money for taxes:** Once you start making a good amount of money, have a CPA and let them help you. But from the beginning, track finances and learn the ins-and-outs of what you will owe and your businesses expenses to write off. 
* **Learn how to do as much as you can on your own:** Build your own website, download Photoshop and create logos, signage, Google ads/advertising, etc. If you don't know how to do something, learn how. 
* **Save, save, save $$$:** This is a more personal thing, but if your business is successful then my personal recommendation is to save and invest as much as you can. Don't increase your lifestyle, just keep living and paying the bills that are necessary and invest the rest. You'll thank yourself in 5-10 years. 
* **Have excellent customer service & get reviews:** Super important. I have just about 850+ five star reviews and this is all due to making customers happy! Treat them well and be reasonable. Be quick to answer your phone, respond to texts/emails, and be a good person!
* **Utilize Google Ads:** If you are providing a service-based business, then utilize Google Search Ads to target people searching via Google for your specific service. Super worth it!

Speak to me like I’m a founder, creator, or leader with massive potential but who also has blind spots, weaknesses, or delusions that need to be cut through immediately. I don’t want comfort. I don’t want fluff. I want truth that stings, if that’s what it takes to grow.  
Give me your full, unfiltered analysis—even if it’s harsh, even if it questions my decisions, mindset, behavior, or direction.  
Look at my situation with complete objectivity and strategic depth. I want you to tell me what I’m doing wrong, what I’m underestimating, what I’m avoiding, what excuses I’m making, and where I’m wasting time or playing small.  
Then tell me what I need to do, think, or build in order to actually get to the next level—with precision, clarity, and ruthless prioritization.  
If I’m lost, call it out. If I’m making a mistake, explain why. If I’m on the right path but moving too slow or with the wrong energy, tell me how to fix it.  
Hold nothing back. Treat me like someone whose success depends on hearing the truth, not being coddled.

1k73fua,Started My Own Vending Machine Business – Here’s How It’s Going and What I’ve Learned,"Hey everyone,
I recently launched Snackaholic Vending LLC, my own small vending machine business, and I thought I’d share a bit about the journey so far—for anyone curious about vending as a side hustle or business model.

Right now, I’m focusing on placing modern snack and drink machines in offices, apartment complexes, gyms, and retail spaces around my local area. It’s a zero-cost service for location owners, and I handle everything—inventory, restocking, maintenance, and even custom snack selections based on the audience.

What’s worked so far:
	•	Offering card + mobile payment options (people barely carry cash)
	•	Staying active on local platforms like Nextdoor and Facebook Groups
	•	Keeping machines super clean and stocked with name-brand snacks
	•	Building relationships with property managers—huge for growth

Challenges:
	•	Finding good, high-traffic locations
	•	Managing logistics and time as a solo operator
	•	Staying competitive with pricing without sacrificing profit

If anyone is thinking about getting into vending or wants tips, I’m happy to share what I’ve learned so far. Or if you’re running a small business and want snacks on-site for staff or customers, I’m also open to connecting.

Thanks for reading—appreciate this community!

1k6ybtm,This is beyond my wildest dreams. Made 2000 in 15 days,"My friends think that i just got lucky, little do they know the hard work that i put into getting these sales.

Im a logo designer, and im really good at what i do. I decided to start freelancing, i had about 6 months worth of savings, and today is the end of the 5th month. 

I thougjt i wasnt gonna make it, and i'd have to move back to my moms basement.  But today marks my second project completed. 

How i got the sales ? I went to every bakery, barber and cafe in my area, offered a brand refresh. Got 1 logo design project after 20 day ago and then another last week.

Im really happy, and now im in contact with 2 more leads, hopefully i will get another sale.

Im glad that i made this work, but this process is too slow and tiring, i have to visit 3 to 4 businesses every day. Any tips on how this can be made a bit easy.

1k8nhn5,"Started a restaurant, my partner bailed and now I’m drowning – what the hell do I do?","Hey,

last year, I started a restaurant in a Czech city (Ostrava) with someone who was still my friend back then and now I don’t know what to do anymore—I’m completely drained... My ex-friend was the chef and was supposed to be the cornerstone of our whole idea, but unfortunately, before we even managed to open, he bailed on me. I was suddenly facing a tough decision: either go through with it alone or give up... I decided to push forward and honestly, looking back now, I’m not sure if I made the right call... But I didn’t really have much of a choice—I had already rented the place, had all the equipment, suppliers, and staff lined up...

The first month looked promising, it worked fairly well because people saw a new place and came to check it out... It brought in money, customers were mostly happy, everyone seemed satisfied—except the damn staff and me... Why? Because I was literally sleeping at the restaurant, my entire life outside of it fell apart and I still hate the place, even though I spend 16 hours there every single day... Still doing good when it comes to money, BUT.

Even though I hired two chefs, both turned out to be complete idiots who, for some reason, just couldn’t function. I’ve gone through maybe ten different people (both experienced and fresh out of school), and every single time, I had to yell at them because it always ended with me doing their job... Same story with the waitresses. One working behind the bar, one on the floor serving food... Guess what? One of them did everything, while the other spent every 30 minutes on the phone or out smoking. Meanwhile, the one who was running around like crazy would come up to me after a week and say she was done and that I could go to hell...

So it’s been one disaster after another. Everything works—except the staff. And from what I’ve heard from others in this business, it’s the same everywhere... I don’t know what to do anymore, how to find someone actually willing to work... I offer fair conditions—average pay (and I always try to be flexible, if their base pay is low, they get the rest in cash), plus they’re all getting state support too, so in the end they make more money than I do. And then I show up in the morning, and instead of the kitchen guys prepping everything for lunch like they should be, they bitch at me—and I have to do it myself... Like everything.

Yesterday I couldn’t take it anymore and fired them both... I had to close for the weekend and now I have no idea what to do—whether to give up or find some new idiot to take their place... I’ve gone through so many people and no one in this industry is willing to actually work...

they kept messaging me on linkedin non stop so i finally checked their profile looked super legit. nice branding, testimonials, “helped raise $4B+”, big claims. i thought ok maybe they have real investor connections.

so i booked a call. they pitched me hard. said they had access to thousands of investors 2200 angels, 900 family offices, 1200 vcs. promised outreach by email and linkedin, daily updates, high success rate (they literally told me 90%).  

they sounded confident and professional. said they’d support the process, help with docs, do calls with investors, all of it.

then they asked for $6500 upfront.  

i thought if they’re really that connected, it’s worth the money. worst decision ever.

after i paid, it all went downhill.  

they sent out random cold emails that i could’ve written better myself.  

they used my linkedin to send connection requests with super generic messages.  

no intros. no follow-ups. no investors interested.  

literally just spam. no real traction.  

and the “daily reports”? useless. just lists of names i never heard from again.

when i asked them where the actual investor calls were, they kept stalling.  

they don’t introduce you to anyone. they don’t negotiate anything. they just copy-paste messages and hope someone replies.

they sold me a glorified cold outreach service. that’s it.  

not a single useful result came out of it. complete waste of time and money.

so yeah. if you’re thinking about working with marquee equity – don’t.

1k9g788,Why Persistence Not Talent Is the Hidden Skill That Separates Winners from Everyone Else,"One thing I wish I'd understood earlier in my entrepreneurial journey is that it’s not talent that makes the difference. It’s not connections, or luck, or even having the perfect idea.

It’s persistence, the ability to stay in the game long after it gets uncomfortable, tedious, or downright brutal.

Research from the University of Pennsylvania found that grit, a blend of passion and perseverance, is a stronger predictor of success than IQ or social intelligence. And when you look at real examples, it’s the overlooked names that tell the true story:

* **Howard Schultz** (Starbucks) got turned down by over 200 investors.
* **William Wilberforce** spent 20+ years fighting to abolish the British slave trade.
* **J.K. Rowling** faced 12 rejections before anyone would publish *Harry Potter*.

They weren’t the loudest, richest, or luckiest. They just kept showing up.

The deeper truth?

  
Persistence isn't just raw stubbornness, it's emotional intelligence at work. It’s the ability to regulate your emotions when you're facing setbacks, rejections, and doubts... and still move forward.

**If you can master that, you unlock the real unfair advantage.**

Key lessons I’ve learned about persistence:

* Redefine failure as feedback, not defeat.
* Manage your inner chit chat ruthlessly.
* Stack micro-wins to create momentum.
* Anchor into a deeper why that’s bigger than temporary setbacks.
* Plan smart recovery, not emotional quitting.

If you're on the edge of giving up right now, maybe this is your signal:  
**DON'T!**

You're closer than you think.

1k497i3,"I’m legally responsible for everything in our business, but my partner calls himself CEO without agreement — what should I do","Hey everyone,

I really need some advice regarding a business I co-founded with a friend. We’re running a Shopify store that’s starting to grow — but our roles and responsibilities are getting blurry, and it’s making me uncomfortable.

Here’s the situation:

* **Everything is legally under my name** in Germany: the business registration, taxes, payment accounts — I’m the one officially responsible.
* However, my business partner listed himself as **CEO** — without ever asking or discussing it with me. He just said, *“I’m a good CEO.”*
* When we deal with suppliers or potential clients, **he introduces himself as the CEO**, even though I carry all the legal and financial risk.
* In the Shopify store, **he’s the store owner**, and I’m only a staff member (even though it’s all running under my company and name).
* To make it worse: **he has tax debt in another country**, which I only found out recently.

We’re supposed to be equal partners, and he did come up with the initial idea — but I’ve handled almost everything on the backend. Now I’m starting to worry:

# My questions:

1. If something goes wrong (e.g., taxes, liabilities, legal issues), **am I the one who’s fully responsible**, even though he calls himself the CEO?
2. Should I demand to be listed as the **Shopify store owner** since it’s all under my name legally?
3. We don’t have a written agreement or contract yet — how can I **protect myself legally**, especially given the financial/legal exposure?
4. Does the fact that he has outstanding **tax issues abroad** affect me or the business if things go south?

I'm trying to be fair — we’re building this together — but I don’t want to get screwed for being “too nice.”  
Has anyone been in a similar situation? Would love to hear your advice or ideas on how to move forward.

1k5egq2,So many opportunities.,"I see so many posts every week asking what to do. Find value and bring it to the marketplace.

I had my wife's F250 in a shop today for a repair that was scheduled ahead of time due to our busy schedule. They tear apart the truck, come in and confirm what's wrong, and say they need to find the parts.

Disappointed that they did not have the parts, but I understand small businesses and the cash flow cost equations.

They call 8 parts stores with 35 miles, 3 Ford dealerships, and a bin runners I recommended to them. (I own a commercial truck parts manufacturing and sales business and have lots of contacts in the parts world.)

Nobody had the parts. ORileys could have them by 4pm. I called my contacts at Ford and had them go through their parts system. No dealerships in Texas had these very common parts. Friday at the earliest.

I cannot sit around for that so I called a car to take me back to the office.

I've spent the last 4 hours doing what I do and researching the parts, OEM and aftermarket. 3 manufacturers that supply the supply chain below it. The dealerships are not even buying directly! They are buying from a distributor. This is insane to me, but it's also how I've made a fortune over the years.

I researched the manufacturers and 1 imports, but I believe it's for their other product lines bases on the shipping codes. So all 3 manufacture these parts in America. 

I call a friend that runs a large distributor and ask for his costs, lead time, and annual usage. He gave them to me, and said sorry if you need them there is usually a 1-2 day lead time because they don't keep many on the shelf.

Now with cost in hand from a $3B year distributor  that buys directly from the manufacturers and their selling price range (discount multipliers by volume).  I go back to the price lists from all the dealerships and parts houses.

As an end retail user we are paying the 35-40%+ markup from the distribution link. Then 30-70% markup on the retail side.

I decided I'm going to enter this niche today. I don't know shit about the parts, I'm not mechanical, and I do not plan on spending any capital to start other than samples, and DHL shipping from Texas to India.

I'll have 3 sets of parts arrive to my office Friday. I will ship them to 3 different manufacturing contenders in India. They will identify the grade of steel and composition of materials, make prints, and give me costs of tooling, die making, and lead times for that. Then quote me on moq and packaging & production costs & lead times.

Ill start making price sheets / flyers today in Canva and I'll drop in the pricing in a couple weeks once I have numbers.

I'll spend the time waiting building lists if every medium duty truck repair shop and dealership in America.

My plan will be to supply only to distribution. If they are stupid like the end users, then I'll sell direct to the end user shops.

Either way I'll land a few large orders at a great discount that I'll collect 30% upfront, and that will cover all my costs.

How many other consumable parts are out there will long life spans? How many Ford, or other businesses out there are purchasing parts like fools? How much margin is exploitable out there?

My guess is I'll be able to sell these parts at a massive 30-70% discount and have 2x the net profits of the existing players.

So stop asking and look right in front of you. If you don't have the SKILLS to do thus, than that is your answer on starting a business. You're not ready yet.

Right now, I’m more into business-related topics, self-help books, and I’m not that active on social media. And when I do go online, I usually filter what I consume—things like healthy lifestyle, investing, and traveling.

1k89kzt,How a small step with GPT turned into real business momentum,"There are tons of great ideas that die in your head.
Usually, it ends with opening a few browser tabs, reading something… and that’s it. Energy’s gone. You forget about it.

This time, I did it differently.
I asked GPT a real question: “What’s actually going on in this niche?” — and got a rough but working skeleton of an answer.
A few days later, I opened that chat again, made another small move: clarified the numbers, sketched out the unit economics, found the first factories to reach out to.
Now I’m already shaping the investor pitch and I can clearly see how this initiative fits into my bigger mission: building a strong brand from Kazakhstan.

And it all started not with inspiration. It started with a small, almost invisible step that kept the idea alive.

1k5igl1,It is hard to start a new entrepreneur life at 50. I need help on how to start,"Tbh, I'm almost 50—I'm not there yet, but close. I've worked in the IT industry my whole life, starting when I was 14. I've spent half my time working with technical stuff and then migrated to sales. For the past 15 years, I’ve been doing B2B sales, selling all kinds of high-tech solutions to companies and governments. It’s been a year since my last job. I gave up looking for a new position in sales after I realized most headhunters think I’m too old to compete with younger folks (which is definitely not true).

I've been thinking about starting something on my own, but it's hard to stop the overthinking and move into the action phase. Some areas I’ve looked into so far are:

* Affiliate marketing: perhaps creating content (writing) about things I like (sales, running, IT) and linking to selected products;
* Automated short videos;
* Creating ebooks based on what I’ve learned over the years.

As I said, I feel stuck at this point. I can't figure out which path to follow, and how to start, even though I’m fairly familiar with the basics of all the above. The IT stack required doesn’t scare me. What do you do to overcome this?

  
EDIT:

So many valuable feedback! Thank you all so much! It is clear to me I may have all I need, perhaps just needed the motivation I am getting by y'all.

  
I’m leaning more towards sharing my sales expertise. I’ve been thinking about it more and more, and I feel I can create valuable content. I just need to focus on learning how to monetize it.

In B2B sales, both sides typically have a mature set of people and tools, but perhaps I can take the sales knowledge I’ve gained working with large companies and share it with the SMB space. For example, solopreneurs are often a one-person operation, handling both marketing and sales to attract customers and grow. They might benefit from a sales and marketing strategy tailored to their needs.

I also think about the full sales cycle and what the best tools are for small businesses. I’ve worked with so many software solutions that help drive sales, and I believe I can guide them on how to filter the noise and choose the best approach for their niche.

Perhaps I've started something good here, and the feedback helped a lot!

As I said, I feel stuck at this point. I can't figure out which path to follow, and how to start, even though I’m fairly familiar with the basics of all the above. The IT stack required doesn’t scare me. What do you do to overcome this?

  
EDIT:

So many valuable feedback! Thank you all so much! It is clear to me I may have all I need, perhaps just needed the motivation I am getting by y'all.

  
I’m leaning more towards sharing my sales expertise. I’ve been thinking about it more and more, and I feel I can create valuable content. I just need to focus on learning how to monetize it.

In B2B sales, both sides typically have a mature set of people and tools, but perhaps I can take the sales knowledge I’ve gained working with large companies and share it with the SMB space. For example, solopreneurs are often a one-person operation, handling both marketing and sales to attract customers and grow. They might benefit from a sales and marketing strategy tailored to their needs.

I also think about the full sales cycle and what the best tools are for small businesses. I’ve worked with so many software solutions that help drive sales, and I believe I can guide them on how to filter the noise and choose the best approach for their niche.

Perhaps I've started something good here, and the feedback helped a lot! Thanks again.",it is hard to start a new entrepreneur life at i need help on how to start tbh im almost im not there yet but close ive worked in the it industry my whole life starting when i was ive spent half my time working with technical stuff and then migrated to sales for the past years ive been doing bb sales selling all kinds of hightech solutions to companies and governments its been a year since my last job i gave up looking for a new position in sales after i realized most headhunters think im too old to compete with younger folks which is definitely not true ive been thinking about starting something on my own but its hard to stop the overthinking and move into the action phase some areas ive looked into so far are affiliate marketing perhaps creating content writing about things i like sales running it and linking to selected products automated short videos creating ebooks based on what ive learned over the years as i said i feel stuck at this point i cant figure out which path to follow and how to start even though im fairly familiar with the basics of all the above the it stack required doesnt scare me what do you do to overcome this edit so many valuable feedback thank you all so much it is clear to me i may have all i need perhaps just needed the motivation i am getting by yall im leaning more towards sharing my sales expertise ive been thinking about it more and more and i feel i can create valuable content i just need to focus on learning how to monetize it in bb sales both sides typically have a mature set of people and tools but perhaps i can take the sales knowledge ive gained working with large companies and share it with the smb space for example solopreneurs are often a oneperson operation handling both marketing and sales to attract customers and grow they might benefit from a sales and marketing strategy tailored to their needs i also think about the full sales cycle and what the best tools are for small businesses ive worked with so many software solutions that help drive sales and i believe i can guide them on how to filter the noise and choose the best approach for their niche perhaps ive started something good here and the feedback helped a lot thanks again,"sale, ive, need, perhaps, start",2025-04-22 21:42:56

1k7nbcl,How it Really Looks,"Hey guys, I own a small business as well as being a Realtor and doing consulting on the side.

I just want to tell you, especially those of you who are just starting your journey, what starting as an entrepreneur actually looks.

I have around $13k in commissions lined up for the next 2 months, and probably another $25k the following 6 months already in the pipeline.

I have a wife and two kids, and our car just got totaled. We're waiting to see if we get a big enough check to buy a new car. We have one bank account with a dollar on it. One that's overdrafted by -$67, another that's overdrafted by -$200, and a business account that's overdrafted by -$5700. All of this will hopefully be fixed by the end of next week, but we don't know. We never know.

Our landlord (for home, not the business) just decided out of the blue not to renew our lease without explanation, so I'm moving my little family to another place by May 25th. No money for a deposit. Nothing ready. Waiting for a tax return. Not sure how much it'll be.

But I can tell you that almost nothing worries me anymore. The rollercoaster is INTENSE. And I don't know how we've survived up to this point except for hard work, faith in people, and faith in God.

1k92vgv,Success rarely comes when everything is perfect.,"I've seen too many people wait until they have all the answers before getting started.

The truth is that you really understand as you move forward. Not before.

Those who succeed are rarely those who knew everything at the start.
These are the ones who had enough confidence to start, even with doubts.

If you want advice that changed my life:

Move, test, adjust.
No need to plan everything. No need to understand everything.
What you learn while walking is worth a thousand times more than what you read while standing still.

The truth is that you really understand as you move forward. Not before.

Those who succeed are rarely those who knew everything at the start.
These are the ones who had enough confidence to start, even with doubts.

If you want advice that changed my life:

Move, test, adjust.
No need to plan everything. No need to understand everything.
What you learn while walking is worth a thousand times more than what you read while standing still.

1k4iwzw,My 4-month old newsletter just payed for all my scuba diving in the Seychelles,"I’ve already built and sold a newsletter, so this new one (less than 4 months old) is my second go at creating, growing, and operating one.

So far, it’s made me a little over $300, which some might argue is getting pretty close to $100/mo in revenue (not bad). This pays for all 4 dive outings I just booked during my trip to the Seychelles later this summer.

I feel like so many people in the sub talk about pretty technical businesses and startups, but newsletter are still a viable business that have little to no startup costs and are easy for you to launch by yourself.

Here’s some advice I have when it comes to starting a newsletter:
- Pick a niche that’s somewhat fragmented. By this, I mean a niche that has a lot of nuance to it, or many different areas where people gather. My newsletter focuses on startup ideas, for instance. There’s probably 15-20 subreddits with members that would be interested in what I publish. My first newsletter only had 1 relevant subreddit that I could fish in to try and grow which basically made growth through Reddit impossible.
- Consider a marketing first approach when choosing a topic. Is there a really easy way you can imagine advertising a certain kind of newsletter? Once you start this, the only thing you’ll think about is growth, so make sure you have a plan on how to do it before you lock down a topic/niche.
- Spend a weekend making the thing look good. Once you chose a topic/niche, choose some brand colors, make a nice logo and thumbnail image on Canva, make your website look nice/passable (I use Beehiiv’s default web builder), and buy a custom domain name for $10. Go subscribe to a dozen other newsletter and see what you like and dislike about their website AND newsletter design. Copy and improve on them.
- Get a Google Workspace account, add the email address that sends your newsletter as an alternate, and make the Workspace profile picture a moving GIF of your newsletters logo. You can do this in Canva. When people open their inbox, they’ll be drawn to click on the emails with moving profile pictures beside them.
- DON’T choose an interview style format for your newsletters logo where you find and interview a new person each week about X. You will burn out. I did this for my first newsletter and it was NOT sustainable. Picks. Format that you can easily front load if you have a vacation coming up. A topics with tons of content that you have experience on or doesn’t depend on current events.
- Do things that don’t scale in the beginning to get your first 1000 subscribers. Ask all your friends and family to sign up, DM all your Twitter followers, find physical places around town that are in your niche and ask to leave flyers with a QR code (this works in cafes too), post in subreddits that allow it, submit your site to newsletter directories, etc.

So how am I making money?

- Beehiiv Boosts: the platform I use to send my newsletter has a feature that pays me whenever I successfully refer new subs to other newsletters.
- Ads: Beehiiv has an in-house ad network that will occasionally ping me asking to put an ad in one of my upcoming newsletters. I also have a form to allow anyone outside the ad network to run ads for their businesses/SaaS/websites in my newsletter.
- Affiliate links: I can link to products and websites that I’m an affiliate of to get a small cut of any purchases made by people who used the link.
- (Digital) Products: I don’t do this yet but I have plans to list some digital and physical products on the newsletter’s website soon. I can occasionally mention these in the newsletter to help drive sales.

I’m happy to answer questions for anyone interested in this stuff.

1k8tqbe,Thinking about selling my 3D Printing company,"I left my engineering career in 2019 to start a 3D printing company and having been doing so full time since then. It's been a rollercoaster but I'm at the point of making a consistent living plus some profit to reinvest. About $7-8k/month USD. I use 16 printers (Anycubic Mega's if you'll believe that) and average about 2-3 hours of mandatory work per day - setting prints, basic maintenance, etc. The rest of the work is finding new leads, improving my production flow, whatever. I make my own filament so material costs are about $4/kg which brings in $100-200, and I sell my products through 120+ retail stores in Canada and the US.

I'm married, I'm ready to have kids, I'm a little burnt out, and a much as I love what I do, I also have other creative projects I'd love to pursue. Building this company took a lot from me and I'm sort of feeling ready for a change. So it occurred to me that there might be someone out there who'd like to inherit this company - the leads, website, sales channels, brand, automation software, everything. Optionally the printers too. I'm on track to make at least $100k this year, more if I push it, so I'm thinking a value of around $250k but I'm not sure at this point. Just feeling out interest.

1k97uil,The best thing I did for my startup was to stop marketing to other builders,"One of the biggest lessons I learned while building products is that marketing should begin from day one, long before the first line of code is even written. Yet so often, especially in the startup space, marketing is treated as something that comes *after* the product is ready. The classic build first, worry about the audience later approach.

But here’s the truth. If you wait until launch day to start telling your story, you are already too late.

I have seen this pattern repeat endlessly, especially in the AI space. People keep posting their AI wrappers or saas tools in AI subreddits or startup communities, hoping to grab attention. But the hard reality is that most people in these spaces are builders themselves. They are not your customer. They are either working on their own thing or not looking to buy another tool that feels just like the last ten they saw.

In my own journey, the biggest wins came not from marketing to the tech crowd but from focusing on the non-tech audience. The people who have no clue what stack you are using. They do not care if it is built with nextjs, python, or some new fancy framework. They just want their problem solved.

These are the folks who are not impressed by jargon. They are not looking for the words ""AI-powered,"" ""seamless,"" or ""state-of-the-art."" They want simplicity. They want clarity. They want to know how your product makes their life easier.

The best thing I did was to stop pitching to builders and start talking directly to the general audience who actually faced the problem I was solving. That shift alone helped me build my early customer base.

I tried sharing my product in places like Reddit and Twitter builder spaces, and honestly, it often felt like shouting into the void. Everybody is posting their saas project. Everybody is announcing their AI product. It becomes noise. The hard truth is that the people who care about your solution probably are not hanging out in these circles.

If I could share one takeaway, it would be this:  
Talk to your actual customers, not to your peers.

# The Fear Factor

Some people definitely seem spooked by AI advancements:

* Junior devs I mentor keep asking if their jobs will exist in 5 years
* Friend abandoned his CS degree after seeing GitHub Copilot generate ""a whole day's work in seconds""
* Local coding bootcamp enrollment down 30% from last year
* Job security concerns showing up in almost every tech interview I conduct

* I see lots of people doing 10x productivity
* Seeing tons of new ""AI-assisted developer"" job listings that didn't exist a year ago

* Community college instructor told me their intro programming classes are filling up with students wanting to ""work with AI""

A lot of us jump straight into “solving other people’s problems” because that’s what we’re told startups do. But… are you sure you’ve solved your own problems first? Like, really? No struggles at work? No late-night stress?

Everyone has something going on. So why not start there? Build stuff for you. Worst case, no one else uses it—but you do. And that already makes it valuable.

For me, I’m obsessed with puzzles. I started coding puzzles just for fun. My first site had bugs everywhere and made $0 for months. But I loved using it. Friends liked it too. Now it makes $300/month from ads.

Then I built a cleaner version as a little SaaS. Didn’t promote it much. Still got 3 paying users in month one—$11 MRR lol. One even bought a yearly plan, which felt like a win.

I’m still figuring life out. But I’ll keep building tools to fix my own mess. And honestly, that’s the best kind of motivation.

1k63xpe,Trump Admin Tightening SBA Lending Criteria,"This updated set of policies will potentially have significant impact for anyone trying to get business financing to expand, start-up, or buy a business. I have yet to go through the entire doc, which goes into effect June 1, but picked up some highlights:

**Equity Requirements**: 10% equity injection is mandatory. This has long been the norm, but there are some lenders who would work zero cash business acquisition deals. Those days are over.

**Seller Financing Equity Inclusion Limited**: Buyers were using seller financing to cover the equity requirements. This will be limited to 50% of the equity requirement, and only if the seller is on stand-by for the life of the SBA loan.

**Return of the Franchise Directory:** SBA will once again list franchises that are essentially ""pre-approved"" for loans. This will probably steer more people towards opening new franchises vs buying an established independent business.

**Business Sellers Retaining Partial Ownership**: Sellers retaining ANY amount of ownership will now, apparently, have to provide a full, unlimited guarantee, regardless of ownership percentage.

1k69lv4,Try easier not harder,"I was going through the options of what to do with my business after the year has started off with significantly less work than I had the previous two years. Get more education, certifications, jump ship, or revamp things in a big way??!?! These were my ideas for how to get out of this rut.
Why isnt my business doing well and how can I change it? Literally zero clue- I'm not a business man, but surely the solution must be complicated and revolutionary otherwise I would have already figured it out by now.
 Sometimes the solutions are so obviously that it would be insulting to recognize them after ignoring them all this time.
Then I thought to myself, which of these options is easiest? Turns out all of them are hard, expensive, or risky. The actual easiest thing to do is get more business doing the exact same thing I normally get paid to. It's so dumb it just might work...I then called my current clients and cold called new ones to get more work. Something I rarely have done because I haven't needed to in the past and I didn't like the rejection. Eventually I got a new client and it was much easier than going back to school or reinventing the business model.

 So in summary- my problem was I didn't have as much work as I wanted.
My solution was to ask people for more work.
Pretty revolutionary shit...

The point isn't to cold call people. It's the process of double checking the most simple/easy stuff before you start reinventing the wheel. I think it's easy to over look the easiest fixes because it's embarrassing to think you missed the low hanging fruit to begin with. Instead of recognizing my problem , I spent my time trying to big brain myself into more business.

1k7tyol,Thinking of closing my business,"Advice, please. 

I started a production company in 2012 as a side gig to make more money. At first, it was more wedding videos and then it became corporate work. By 2016, it became my full-time career. I hired my first full-time employee and then another and then another and so on.

Now I travel all over the country, create hundreds of social media content and videos for clients, and run a successful business.

Sounds great? I never intended to create a larger company. I just wanted to create something for myself, but as I would meet people they would say, ""I would love to come work for you."" That sort of started this mindset of saving their career and growing mine.

Long story shortish, I am exhausted. I have been doing this for 13 years now. The business makes money, but I do not make nearly what I would if I worked for someone. As most small business owners know, you have to pay employees first, then taxes, health insurance, rent, etc.

On top of that, my family and personal life have really taken a toll on me. My mom is 78 and has been in the hospital twice in the last month (I have been taking care of her constantly as well).

I love telling stories and love the media profession, but I just cannot handle this anymore. I do not like managing people to this point, I am struggling with dealing with all of these clients, and it's just destroying my mental health. I am not contributing enough to my family financially, I am not as present as I want to be, and I am just struggling to really have a purpose.

I could just use some advice.

1k5tqep,What am I not hearing—and why?,"Lately, I’ve been thinking about a certain kind of person.  
Someone who wants to build a super successful business—maybe like you, maybe like me.

They keep a notebook.  
Every day, they write down plans, ideas, goals.  
They wake up hopeful. They try.  
But it’s not clicking.

They have time.  
So they go on Reddit. Ask questions. Answer others.  
They share their thoughts, their process.  
People start listening. Following.  
Even AI learns from them.

But here’s the catch:  
They’re visible *because they have time*.  
Their business isn’t working—so they’re still talking.

Then, one day—it works.  
The business takes off.

Do they come back and explain how they did it?  
Probably not.

They’re quiet now. Focused.  
When something works, you don’t talk about it.  
You build it.

And the notebook?  
It fades.  
Not because they’ve stopped thinking—  
but because they don’t need to write down every possibility anymore.  
Trial and error gives way to direction.

That’s the paradox:  
We often listen to people still figuring it out.  
The ones who’ve made it?  
They go silent.  
Or return decades later to write a book for the next generation.

Every biography I’ve read talks about differentiation—  
doing something only *you* can do.  
But if we’re all following each other in real time,  
we’re just remixing the same half-finished thoughts.

1k9b4kb,I have two Patreons making $3k/month - any ideas on scale?,"Hey everyone,
I run two different Patreons and I’m looking for advice on how to scale them up.

Here’s a quick overview:
• The first Patreon focused on investing and trading — it makes 1.5k/month and has been steady at this amount for around 3 years
• The second Patreon is a sports prediction model — it focuses on helping sports bettors cut down their research on games from hours to essentially nothing. This one makes around $2k/month and only started around 6 months ago (has grown quickly)
• Together, I currently have around a little over 100 paying patrons.
• Each Patreon brings in roughly $30 per month right now, totaling about $3,000 per month between the two.

Both are based around giving subscribers real, usable value they can either make money from, use to grow a skill, or apply to real life for measurable results.

I’m at the stage where it’s proven — people pay monthly, stay subscribed, and a good percentage of them are genuinely happy.
Now I want to figure out: how would you scale this?
I’m open to ideas on marketing, operations, systems, maybe even adding upsells or community-building.

Would love to hear if you’ve been through this or if you have strategies you’ve seen work.

1k8tr1v,Building Unbreakable Self-Trust: Why It’s the #1 Skill No One Talks About,"In my experience, most people don't struggle from lack of ambition — they struggle because they don't trust themselves to follow through.

Self-trust is a muscle.  
It grows every time you **keep a promise to yourself**, no matter how small.

Other days, it’s just doing 5 pushups or sending 1 email you didn’t want to send.

Trust builds when your words and actions align.

Once you become the type of person who *does what they say* (even when it's hard, boring, or scary)...  
it leaks into every other area of your life: health, money, relationships, and confidence.

1k7bis9,"Is ""Vibe Coding"" actually helpful for beginners or just a buzzword?","Been seeing a lot of posts lately about this ""vibe coding"" approach where people just throw together an app based on prompts. Got me thinking about whether this is actually helping newbies or just creating bad habits.

**Pro perspective:** I taught my cousin programming last summer, and honestly, letting them mess around and build confidence before drilling syntax actually worked really well. They ended up:

1. Building small projects they actually cared about first
2. Learning to debug their own mistakes through trial and error
3. Developing intuition about what *might* work before knowing why
4. Eventually circling back to learn fundamentals with more context

**Con perspective:** My team had to onboard a self-taught dev who coded purely by ""vibes"" and it was... painful. Here's what went wrong:

1. Their code worked but was impossible to maintain
2. They couldn't explain their own solutions when bugs appeared
3. Simple optimizations were beyond their understanding
4. We basically had to re-train them from scratch

Personally, I think there's a middle ground. Vibe coding has its place as a confidence builder and for quick prototyping, but without eventually learning proper fundamentals, you hit a ceiling real quick.

1k63gvy,Should I quit my day job or keep building on the side? Need your advice,"Hey folks - looking for some honest perspective here.

I’ve been building on the side for the past 12 months. After a few trials and error, my latest project - a Reddit marketing tool for founders - is finally showing some signs of life. It’s still small, but it looks promising.

Now I’m at a tough crossroads. I need to decide whether I should quit my day job and go all in or play safe by building on the side.

Some background - I'm 30, non-tech, no big backups. I’ve saved up about a year of runway, but I also have some debt to pay off. My current day job is not that exciting - every day I have to drag myself to work. Since I'm non tech background, if things don’t work out, getting another job won’t be easy. That makes the decision feel heavier.

At the same time, I’m starting to see a few competitors popping up, and part of me worries that playing it safe might cost me the first-mover edge. Right now, I get around 5 solid hours a day to work on the project — but there are days when my day job completely drains me, and I get nothing done. It’s frustrating because I know what this project *could* be if I had full focus.

I’m seriously considering quitting and going full-time. But I know it’s a big leap, and not an easy one to undo.

If you’ve been in this situation — how did you decide when to take the leap? What helped you feel okay with taking the risk? What would you do differently if you were in my shoes?

Would really appreciate any thoughts or stories.

My husband and I are trying to save his family’s construction business, which has been operating for over 30 years. He inherited it in 2020, and since then we’ve discovered that a family member who managed the office left a trail of destruction—no taxes filed, under-the-table payments, falsified audits, and over $200k in back taxes. Our accountant ignored it all or wasn’t even legit. The insurance company canceled us after the audit report was manipulated. It’s been a nightmare.

We’ve started whistleblower filings, are documenting everything, and are talking to state agencies. But now we’re at a crossroads.

We need advice on strategy:
	•	Is it smarter to shut it down and start fresh under a new brand?
	•	Can we shield ourselves from the fallout if we do?
	•	Should I start a new company under my name and restructure everything legally and financially?
	•	Or is it worth fighting to salvage the company’s name and reputation?

1k4dihh,I tried selling my app (~$4-6K ARR) (Wallpaper App),"I have been building apps for the customisation community (Extra-ordinary wallpaper app with great UI that includes blurs, glows etc) from the past 5 years but now I have got a full time job.

1k9ikbn,Any women here navigating a career change because they’re burnt out — not just bored?,"
Hi everyone,
I’m curious if this resonates with anyone else…

I’m noticing a lot of career change stories talk about wanting “something new” — but for me (and a few women I’ve been connecting with recently), it’s deeper than that. It’s not just about being bored or wanting a bigger salary.

It’s burnout.
Emotional exhaustion.
Feeling like you’ve lost your spark, your creativity, your connection to yourself.
Waking up and realizing you’ve been pushing so hard for so long that you don’t even know what you truly want anymore.

If you’re a woman going through a career shift, not just for new skills, but because you want a whole new way of living — reconnecting to your purpose, creativity, and peace — I would genuinely love to hear your story.
What are you feeling called toward?
What’s been the hardest part for you?

My burnout story was in healthcare… Covid changed everything and I was in major burnout mode for about 10 months after coming back from maternity leave with my second child.. I was on total auto pilot, and fighter flight every day, and felt like my brain was actually dying. It was the worst. I knew I was meant for more.❤️

1k92d53,Revolutionizing e-commerce marketing with AI: My experience developing PhotoG,"Hello r/Entrepreneur,

Hope you are all doing well. As an entrepreneur, I’m always interested in finding innovative solutions to common business problems. Lately, I’ve been focusing on the e-commerce space, specifically the challenges businesses face in creating high-quality marketing materials.

One of the biggest pain points in e-commerce is the need for attractive product images, engaging videos, and optimized content for a variety of platforms. Creating these materials can be time-consuming and expensive, often requiring specialized skills and resources that many small businesses lack.

That’s why I decided to develop PhotoG, 

I’m very excited that PhotoG has attracted more than 100,000 users. But I'm finding that converting these users to paying customers remains a challenge. I'm considering adopting an activation code system, similar to what many software companies use to manage access and ensure compliance. I'm curious about your thoughts: Have you used products with activation codes? What have your experiences been like, both positive and negative?

More broadly, I'd like to hear your thoughts on the role of AI in marketing. Do you think tools like PhotoG can significantly impact how companies develop marketing strategies? Are there any concerns or limitations?

Also, as entrepreneurs, what factors influence your decision to pay for a new tool or service? Is it the demonstrated value, the company's reputation, or something else? In particular, I'm curious whether strong publicity can convince you to try a new product, or do you need to see actual results first?",1745755338.0,6,1,/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1k92d53/revolutionizing_ecommerce_marketing_with_ai_my/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1k92d53/revolutionizing_ecommerce_marketing_with_ai_my/,Negative-Quiet202,Entrepreneur,1.0,True,False,False,False,0,1745838497.08273,Finance & Business,9,243,251,Sunday,8,April,2025,True,0.9895,0.201,0.043,0.756,positive,Revolutionizing e-commerce marketing with AI: My experience developing PhotoG,"Hello r/Entrepreneur,

1k6yq6s,"I was on the verge of quitting, then created one piece of content.","Howzit everyone,

Been building my company for the last few years.

I run a strategic video company in Cape Town, South Africa and I am finally coming out of my shell.

It’s been f\*$king tough. I’m bootstrapped after losing my job in 2021. Massive blessing and a massive curse. Love every moment and am completely obsessed. NGL

I had a very small family and friends round investment for 15%. It’s basically allowed me to figure out PMF over the last 4 years. I am by no means a financial success but I have sustained myself, freelancers and a stint of employees for a few years by doing what we love.

We had to start super small and only build on what can create. It's been super frustrating and stressful as we need to prove to clients what we can do. If you are familiar with the Drive to Survive case study, our entire business is basically based on this.

I GROSSLY underestimated the education component and the proving of my own hypothesis. Which from the onset, wasn't 100% correct, as most entrepreneurs almost immediately figure out.

Only now, 4+ years later, I am starting to see results.

Anyhoo, let’s cut to the chase because the above is a massive breakdown on it's own, which I am busy compiling a 60 minute video on.

As part of my current strategy, I created a high-value toolkit. I basically sat down and thought about my favourite clients. What do they deal with? What are their actual needs? Who are they? If i took my proiduct out of the equasion, what would actually solve their problem? What can I do to just solve that problem with minimum effort?

I have a background in psychology and education which is a fkin super power I'll tell you.

This toolkit is 40-minutes of me providing the following:

* How to create authentic brand video
* Simple technical guide
* Simple interview guide
* B-Roll guide
* Universal format
* Three formats that are super useful in 2025

This particularly assists:

* B2B marketing teams
* Values first companies
* Family and multigenerational businesses
* Positive impact companies
* NPOs
* Companies with marketing teams of less than 5 and growing quickly
* Content teams with very limited budgets
* Companies in the business of adding tangible value to their clients

There is no funnel. No CRM. fokol(f\*ck all). I haven't had time to do any of this and honestly don't think I ever will.

It's a video and a deck. And a promo that you don’t have to watch. I have sent this to 50 of the high value leads I built up over the last few years. I had ten responses(5 within 48 hours) that are moving into projects.  
  
I now send this to all cold leads as an opener. And here's the thing. After this, they reach out to me. They now see me as imperative to reaching their goals.

60% of the issue we have, in the creative space, is to convince clients we can provide value. Now, I show them exactly how.

This single piece of content is giving me more results than I have ever seen and I basically just sat down to tell people how to do what I do.

I can highly recommend this strategy to anyone out there. Don't give away IP, just add value. Not the linkedin value but actual value to your specific client. If they can see your values, your personality, your vibe, your usp in action, especially in B2B(AND THEY RELATE TO IT), you'll have clients for life.

To all y'all on r/entrepreneur: Thanks for contributing to this community. Lurkers like me find immense value here and it sometimes feels like the only place where people get it. Because God knows I'd be on the backfoot without this. There’s so much value here.

Have your moan, but then try to see the forest for the trees.

Been building my company for the last few years.

I run a strategic video company in Cape Town, South Africa and I am finally coming out of my shell.

It’s been f\*$king tough. I’m bootstrapped after losing my job in 2021. Massive blessing and a massive curse. Love every moment and am completely obsessed. NGL

I had a very small family and friends round investment for 15%. It’s basically allowed me to figure out PMF over the last 4 years. I am by no means a financial success but I have sustained myself, freelancers and a stint of employees for a few years by doing what we love.

We had to start super small and only build on what can create. It's been super frustrating and stressful as we need to prove to clients what we can do. If you are familiar with the Drive to Survive case study, our entire business is basically based on this.

I GROSSLY underestimated the education component and the proving of my own hypothesis. Which from the onset, wasn't 100% correct, as most entrepreneurs almost immediately figure out.

Only now, 4+ years later, I am starting to see results.

Anyhoo, let’s cut to the chase because the above is a massive breakdown on it's own, which I am busy compiling a 60 minute video on.

As part of my current strategy, I created a high-value toolkit. I basically sat down and thought about my favourite clients. What do they deal with? What are their actual needs? Who are they? If i took my proiduct out of the equasion, what would actually solve their problem? What can I do to just solve that problem with minimum effort?

I have a background in psychology and education which is a fkin super power I'll tell you.

This toolkit is 40-minutes of me providing the following:

* How to create authentic brand video
* Simple technical guide
* Simple interview guide
* B-Roll guide
* Universal format
* Three formats that are super useful in 2025

This particularly assists:

* B2B marketing teams
* Values first companies
* Family and multigenerational businesses
* Positive impact companies
* NPOs
* Companies with marketing teams of less than 5 and growing quickly
* Content teams with very limited budgets
* Companies in the business of adding tangible value to their clients

There is no funnel. No CRM. fokol(f\*ck all). I haven't had time to do any of this and honestly don't think I ever will.

It's a video and a deck. And a promo that you don’t have to watch. I have sent this to 50 of the high value leads I built up over the last few years. I had ten responses(5 within 48 hours) that are moving into projects.  
  
I now send this to all cold leads as an opener. And here's the thing. After this, they reach out to me. They now see me as imperative to reaching their goals.

60% of the issue we have, in the creative space, is to convince clients we can provide value. Now, I show them exactly how.

This single piece of content is giving me more results than I have ever seen and I basically just sat down to tell people how to do what I do.

I can highly recommend this strategy to anyone out there. Don't give away IP, just add value. Not the linkedin value but actual value to your specific client. If they can see your values, your personality, your vibe, your usp in action, especially in B2B(AND THEY RELATE TO IT), you'll have clients for life.

To all y'all on r/entrepreneur: Thanks for contributing to this community. Lurkers like me find immense value here and it sometimes feels like the only place where people get it. Because God knows I'd be on the backfoot without this. There’s so much value here.

Have your moan, but then try to see the forest for the trees.

Shap, shap. Much love.

1k63ox8,Seeking advice for my bookkeeping startup,"Hi guys, so I'm a bookkeeper with over 10 years experience managing books on the side, mostly my family's. I've decided to get serious about it about a year ago and have been studying accounting and have a mentorship. I have a mentor who's willing to support me on the books side of things. 

But I feel like I need help with the marketing and sales side of things. 

I have a plan, but idk if it's a good one. 

Before all this I was set on becoming a software engineer and I successfully built a well-built website, but idk if it's a good sales machine. 

I think it looks cool, and i'm proud of it, because I built it, but would you guys look at it and go ""Hey this guy looks like he is good at what he does, I would definitely hire him to do my books/website""?

Here's a list of the things I have planned for marketing.

Cold calls - I was told not to do it from a marketing professor. Chatgpt says it works, and it could land me deals. I'm used to being on the phones a lot, so it's not a super big deal. Just wish I didn't have to be. I'm more of a relax my face muscles kinda guy.

I'm planning to do business as myself. No fancy names. Pleeeeease don't doxx me, I provide for little ones. 

Clearly I have a domain name, and I have a basic services agreement. 

Considering hiring a webdesigner to make a better design for my website, but idk it's even worth the money or time. 

My client onboarding will be manual data entry

I plan to make a page, and make my personal facebook represent me as a bookkeeper. I'm even wondering if a page is worth it, but also I could contract others to keep it active, and engaging others. 

  \- create facebook flyers to be shared  
  \- I plan to join relevant groups, make relevant comments and posts that aid in making people aware of what I do. 

Linkedin, I already have in action. I'm considering upgrading to their premium service so I can contact business owners directly. 

Add myself to next door and if you know any similar services, that would be great.

Google alert for Florida Landlord Bookkeeping or real estate Quickbooks

Place flyers at strategic locations, soon as I know those strategic locations. 

Create regular craigslist ads around Florida. 

Create a referral program to generate word of mouth leads. 

Mail and email flyers, and reach out to property managers and landlords and local accountants. 

Occasionally generate a blog post about the important of bookkeeping, writing about the pros and cons, generate by ai of course, doctored to look human. I don't actually have time to write posts myself but i'll scan them to make sure I agree with the message. 



I have a working mini blog, with sign ups that can be found on my website. 

   \- currently I have some irrelevant into about not liking public profiles on facebook posts for privacy and peace of mind. 

   \- Mini stories about how my services have helped business owners save money. 

I plan to use Excel or maybe google sheets for like my CRM

I plan to offer free consults.

Discounted first months

I plan to post to Thumbtacks, Bark, Upwork, and I'm already posted on Fiverr   
\-- I plan to hire someone to make better digital images.

1k9h1yu,Why Your Google Ads Are Burning Money (And How to Actually Make Them Work) From An Industry Veteran & Fellow Small Business Owner,"If you’re a small business owner and you’ve tried running Google Ads to get leads, but ended up frustrated, bleeding money, and thinking “this doesn’t work” or “this is a scam”, you’re not alone.

I manage Google Ads campaigns professionally and for my own small business (and even freelance on the side), and let me tell you: It’s not your fault. I've been doing paid search for over 10 years and I've worked on both small and large accounts (including everything from literally a barbershop down the street and a local plumbing business, to companies like Bloomingdale's, NFL, and Etsy).

Here’s the brutal truth: Google makes it way too easy for small businesses to waste thousands of dollars without even realizing it. Here’s how it happens — and what you can do about it.

⸻

1. “Smart Campaigns” Are Not Smart

If you hit the “Easy Mode” setup that Google automatically funnels you through, you’re almost guaranteed to target the wrong people and lose money.

- Your ads show for broad, irrelevant searches.
- You’re paying $20–$50 per click for people who aren’t even looking for what you sell.
- You have no control over the terms you’re showing up for.

Fix: You need to manually build campaigns in Expert Mode, with thoughtful keyword targeting.

⸻

2. Your Match Types Are Probably Screwed Up

Google defaults most keywords to Broad Match — which is insanely wide. Also, no you are not “upgrading” your keywords to broad match. It’s not an “upgrade”; it’s a different match type.

Example: If you sell “red sneakers” in Miami, you could be showing up for “maroon high heels” in NYC.

Fix: Use Exact Match or Phrase Match properly, and layer in negative keywords. Most accounts I audit have zero negative keywords — that’s like driving without brakes.

⸻

3. You’re Letting Google Pick Where Your Ads Show (and They Pick Badly)

Google Ads includes Search, Display, YouTube, Gmail, Discovery — all lumped together by default.

Search is great. The rest… not so much for lead gen. Especially if you’re a small business just getting started with online advertising and you don’t have sophisticated measurement tools and methodologies in place.

Fix: Make sure you’re running Search Network Only campaigns if you want quality leads. Period.

⸻

4. You’re Optimizing for Clicks Instead of Customers

Google will optimize for clicks if you let it — and clicks don’t pay your bills.

Fix: Set up proper conversion tracking (phone calls, form fills, etc.) and optimize for actual leads, not traffic. Ideally, optimize for actual customers and not just leads.

⸻

5. You’re Missing the Goldmine: Search Terms Data

Your account has a secret weapon: The Search Terms Report shows exactly what people typed when they clicked your ad.

Most business owners don’t even know this exists.

Fix: Check it weekly.

- Add good searches as keywords.
- Block bad searches with negatives

This alone can turn an unprofitable campaign profitable.

⸻

6. You’re Ignoring Auction Insights (And Flying Blind Against Competitors)

Imagine running a business but never checking what your competitors are doing. No idea what they charge, no idea how they market, no idea how big they are. You’d get eaten alive, right?

That’s exactly what happens when you ignore Auction Insights in Google Ads.

Auction Insights shows you:

- Who else is competing against you.
- How often you’re beating them for top spots.
- Whether someone bigger just jumped into your market with a pile of cash.

If you don’t check it, you’re basically in a boxing match — blindfolded — and wondering why you keep getting punched in the face.

Fix: Check Auction Insights every 1–2 weeks. If you see new aggressive competitors, tighten your targeting or tweak your bids. If you’re losing impression share to weaker players, it might be a quality issue (time to fix ad copy, landing page, or bidding strategy).

⸻
Quick Bonus Tips:

- Geo-target tightly. Don’t run national if you only serve your metro area.

- Write clear, no-BS ads. Focus on benefits, offers, and a strong CTA. Don’t try to push some fluffy brand message.

- Test, but don’t thrash. Let campaigns run for a few days before making changes.

⸻

Bottom Line:

If you fix even half of the mistakes above, you’ll probably see your cost per lead drop by 30–50% in a month.

1k8aat0,Getting a part time job on top of my business,"For 4 years I was running a small videography agency freelancing on the side of my 9-5 in London where I was making around £50k. I was not enjoying my current company at the time so thought fuck it I might as well go all in on my business and my current career wasn’t one I wanted long term, so I thought I had nothing to lose. That was last June.

Since then, I’ve managed to pay all my bills, my tax returns and manage to live a cheaper but somewhat decent life, I’ve just not been able to live as extravagant as once but I knew that would be the case for a while.

The start of the year I was averaging £3k per month which I was really happy with, however the last 2 months have been tough, generating maybe 1.5k a month at max. 

One night whilst I was spiralling I applied for a bunch of part time jobs in my area. One came back to me and offered me a trial day which I did this week and they offered me the job to work 3 days a week. I’ve said yes because I don’t wanna say no and have regrets.

I guess what I’m saying is I can’t shake this feeling of shame or feeling like crap. I have a fear of what people will think of me which is ridiculous I know because I’m doing what needs to be done, but I feel such shame for being in my late 20’s working part time in such a mundane and boring part time role. I feel like I’ve failed and I’m embarrassed to tell anyone, especially my own dad as I feel he will tell me I’m being silly and making a mistake.

He has his own business which is very successful and he lets me do the odd few days there to work, but I find working with him difficult, which has steered me to wanna be independent.

1k62ar6,Boring Business Vs SaaS?,"Why I am switching my focus from SaaS to a sweaty and boring business?

The appeal of a SaaS startup has always been intriguing to me. I love how you can build something and let it compound while working remotely and from anywhere. I have wanted this, I have been working on this. But the results? Big Fat 0's.

I am not a super technical person - I use mostly No-Code tools and website builders like shopify / wordpress. So perhaps it has come to be time for me to move along.

I am going to aim for something else entirely - stepping aside from the software side to build boring first.

I know this will not scale as quickly or possibly as large, but it seems that there is FAR less competition in this space now. Additionally, the success rate is probably far greater in terms of percentages of business turning profitable in this space simply due to the sheer numbers of people building SaaS and AI style businesses at the moment.

The follow on effect and idea once the boring business becomes profitable would be to deeply understand and then identify ways to integrate perhaps a SaaS or other digital business to supplement the boring business. Using the profits of the boring business to build this side out by hiring the necessary dev team to get it done.

I am leaving this open to discussion - who else has done this or is thinking of pivoting from building online to IRL with an online play afterwards?

1k8e0ye,Finally having the resources but no clue what to do with it,"So, I have quite an ""extensive"" history when it comes to entrepreneurship. With a background in engineering, business administration and finance I've tried all kinds of things from early beginnings with an online shop in my mid-late teens through trying to live off of trading & poker all the way to wholesale and even a manufacturing business in my 20's, but always ran into one main issue: Money. Back in my 20's I had VERY little resources and I feel like some of my businesses might've had a better chance if I would've had more resources to pour into machines, marketing, etc. I was just always very constrained and had to try making something out of almost nothing, and it usually stalled when the first big investments would've had to be made.

Then in my late 20's I stumbled into a different industry and started working as a consultant, selling my time. Over the years this has turned into a quite lucrative gig, raking in 200-250k USD after taxes a year, but there's one big issue: Over the years (am in my mid 30's now) I started to really hate it. I absolutely dread every Monday and spend a considerable amount of time every week thinking about how to break out of this golden cage. It is REALLY wearing me down but then there's no way I could get myself to just give up on 250k/y short of me physically/mentally not being able to do the job anymore. And while I do have very noticeable signs of burnout by now, I keep telling myself that it only takes another 10 years until I can retire and that it will hopefully get better with the next project.

So this brings me to the reason for this post, me seeking advice. I was contemplating all kinds of options regarding how I could escape my golden cage and my ideal solution would be some kind of business ""on the side"" (I work at least 40h/week and hardly have any energy left outside of work, so my involvement would be rather limited, although I could imagine spending at least 5-10h/week on it if I really enjoy it.) where I would make up for my limited time outside of work with money. I thought about maybe buying an already established business in an industry I like and that I have some limited knowledge of (e.g. renewables) where the income potential would probably not be too far above my current income, but at least I would enjoy my job, or start something completely new from scratch. In both cases I would obviously need to have someone else at least representing myself taking care of operations while I could only do the strategic part, as I don't really see a business that I can only spend a few hours of my precious and dearly needed weekends on to take off before I could retire just grinding away for another 10 years.

And since the question of ""So how much are you planning to spend?!"" is probably going to come up: \~500k in more or less liquid assets, that I would prefer not to liquidate for it, and about 10k/month that I'm saving for my ""early retirement"" currently, which I could use for any venture with the same goal instead, if needed able to increase to 12-13k/month tops.

So, what's your take ... Is this hope generally realistic or just a really bad idea, bound to burn money with nothing to show for? Is there really just the option of taking huge risks by committing 100%? My main advantage also seems to be my main issue: Huge opportunity costs. So while I do have the resources in terms of capital I do not have them in terms of time and acquiring both means huge opportunity costs of unearned income, which makes every business started this way a lot riskier. How would you go about this? I do have a friend that bought a very small company about a year ago that has tons of company ""exposé's"" that I asked her for to have a look at to get a feeling for what it would take and what I could expect if I were to buy a company. But buying one also means a lot of additional risk and investment, so maybe trying to start something cheaper from scratch would be the way to go?

Cheers!",finally having the resources but no clue what to do with it so i have quite an extensive history when it comes to entrepreneurship with a background in engineering business administration and finance ive tried all kinds of things from early beginnings with an online shop in my midlate teens through trying to live off of trading poker all the way to wholesale and even a manufacturing business in my s but always ran into one main issue money back in my s i had very little resources and i feel like some of my businesses mightve had a better chance if i wouldve had more resources to pour into machines marketing etc i was just always very constrained and had to try making something out of almost nothing and it usually stalled when the first big investments wouldve had to be made then in my late s i stumbled into a different industry and started working as a consultant selling my time over the years this has turned into a quite lucrative gig raking in k usd after taxes a year but theres one big issue over the years am in my mid s now i started to really hate it i absolutely dread every monday and spend a considerable amount of time every week thinking about how to break out of this golden cage it is really wearing me down but then theres no way i could get myself to just give up on ky short of me physicallymentally not being able to do the job anymore and while i do have very noticeable signs of burnout by now i keep telling myself that it only takes another years until i can retire and that it will hopefully get better with the next project so this brings me to the reason for this post me seeking advice i was contemplating all kinds of options regarding how i could escape my golden cage and my ideal solution would be some kind of business on the side i work at least hweek and hardly have any energy left outside of work so my involvement would be rather limited although i could imagine spending at least hweek on it if i really enjoy it where i would make up for my limited time outside of work with money i thought about maybe buying an already established business in an industry i like and that i have some limited knowledge of eg renewables where the income potential would probably not be too far above my current income but at least i would enjoy my job or start something completely new from scratch in both cases i would obviously need to have someone else at least representing myself taking care of operations while i could only do the strategic part as i dont really see a business that i can only spend a few hours of my precious and dearly needed weekends on to take off before i could retire just grinding away for another years and since the question of so how much are you planning to spend is probably going to come up k in more or less liquid assets that i would prefer not to liquidate for it and about kmonth that im saving for my early retirement currently which i could use for any venture with the same goal instead if needed able to increase to kmonth tops so whats your take is this hope generally realistic or just a really bad idea bound to burn money with nothing to show for is there really just the option of taking huge risks by committing my main advantage also seems to be my main issue huge opportunity costs so while i do have the resources in terms of capital i do not have them in terms of time and acquiring both means huge opportunity costs of unearned income which makes every business started this way a lot riskier how would you go about this i do have a friend that bought a very small company about a year ago that has tons of company exposés that i asked her for to have a look at to get a feeling for what it would take and what i could expect if i were to buy a company but buying one also means a lot of additional risk and investment so maybe trying to start something cheaper from scratch would be the way to go eager to hear your takes cheers,"would, business, could, year, really",2025-04-26 14:19:21
1k8djtk,When is the right time?,"So, I started my business not long ago. My goodness I jumped in to the deep end with it. I have a product that meets the needs of a problem. But now I feel like I am stuck. Because I created a product, got a patent, started a business, now working on growing it. 

The part I am stuck on is do I reach out to investors to get funding to mass produce my product? I struggle with this in a couple ways. 

1) this is my idea that I worked so hard on, it’s hard to want to bring others in on this because of how much time and effort I put in to make my product. I am not sure if this is me being scared of someone else trying to come in and control things. I struggle with wanting to give up equity (I know, I know what equity) I don’t know if it’s normal for people to feel that way or it’s just me? 

2) yeah I have brought things along this far. But I haven’t sold anything yet. So, how do I approach someone and say hey invest in me? When I don’t have sales am I trying to get someone to invest in the product or the potential market? 

Can anyone relate to this or point me in the right direction? I am not sure if I should seek angle investors, partners or do people look for loans and grants? It’s difficult because without sales I assume people are assuming you are trying to sell them bottles of hope and potential for the future without knowing what it will turn out to be. 

What advice, or thoughts forward do you have? 
Also, I am in the running for a SBIR grant through NSF. Although with current economics who knows if that will actually happen.

1k8df3o,Anyone on here built Photography greenhouse/ sets?

Fast forward to today, and we're a team of 11 based in Coimbatore, India   
developers, designers, marketers, all working hard to create top-notch mobile apps.

Coming from a tech background, the development side comes naturally. But when it comes to sales and scaling, that's where I'm stuck.

We’ve primarily relied on Meta ads for leads, but to be honest, the results haven’t been as strong as expected. I know the power of digital marketing, but I’m struggling to make the most of it. The cost of ads seems to outweigh the returns, and I’m looking for more sustainable ways to generate quality leads.  
  
I’m open to investing more into marketing, but I want to focus on strategies that can bring in steady, long-term results.

  
If you've been in this situation, how did you transition from struggling with sales to getting more consistent leads?  
  
What strategies worked for you to scale your client base without relying so heavily on paid ads?

1k6oyy7,"Business Idea: Premium AI Data Labeling with Retired Domain Experts (Legal, Medical, Finance)","I'm exploring a niche B2B services business in the AI data labeling space.

The core idea: Instead of using low-cost, generic crowdworkers, I want to build a **high-quality, human-in-the-loop labeling service** that leverages **retired professionals** (e.g., ex-lawyers, doctors, bankers) to annotate sensitive, high-context data in regulated industries like **legal, medical, and finance**.

**Why it matters:**

* As AI becomes more specialized, the need for *contextually accurate*, *compliant*, and *trustworthy* training data is exploding.
* Generic annotators can't reliably label legal contracts, medical records, or financial disclosures.
* Most data labeling providers today focus on volume, not quality.
* Retired experts are a massively underutilized, motivated, and credible workforce.

**The wedge:**

* Start with one vertical (e.g. legal).
* Recruit 5–10 verified retired legal professionals.
* Deliver premium labeling services to a pilot client (e.g. contract clause classification, document triage for LLM training, etc.).
* Emphasize trust, compliance (GDPR/HIPAA), and subject-matter accuracy as key differentiators.

1k6o7e5,Validating an idea for a lean sales support service—curious what founders think,"Hey all,

I’ve been working in B2C/B2B sales for 15+ years and I'm playing with the idea of going solo, offering a lightweight, freelance-style sales support service—designed for small business owners or solo founders who are too busy to do consistent outreach themselves.

The concept is: I’d help businesses generate new conversations with qualified prospects, without them needing to hire a full-time sales rep or agency. Outbound prospecting, lead warming, and handover to the founder for closing. No over-engineered funnels, just consistent pipeline movement/reporting, with a couple of USP's from my experience, knowing what works. 

It’s still early stage, but before I go all in, It'd be great to get honest feedback from founders on a few things:

Does this kind of offer appeal to small teams / solo operators?

Is retainer + commission a reasonable pricing model?

Would you want someone to stay “top of funnel” only, or keep support going post-conversion?

Any horror stories or wins with freelancers doing this kind of work?

Not pitching anything—just curious if this has legs or if I’m missing something obvious. Happy to return feedback if you're testing something too.

Appreciate any thoughts, feel free to dm. Thanks all!

I buy a certain used item from privates all over my country and sell to export to different countries all to proffesionals b2b (i'm in Europe). Last year i did 1,2m EUR in sales with a take home (before taxes and my salary) of 400k eur. As i'm all by my self this is all good for me, but i see the possibility to grow this business, but then i can not do it all by my self. 

My biggest issue: I sell to several professionals in different countries, i always try to get their best offer, but most of them always wants my selling price, which i understand, because they dont want to pay more than neccesary of course, but i want the best offer, also when selling to different countries the market prices also varies a lot of course, and the same item can have totally different prices depending on the country and type of dealer. 

I have long been thinking of starting an auction, but this requires a whole different setup and a lot of money. 

I right now have to options.

1.

I ""know"" a guy who build and sold a very large online car auction (sold it for +130m eur). He could start this in pretty much 1 day. Have all the knowledge, but they also have a seperate ""buying"" company who buys vehicles for the auction, which is pretty much what i do, just in another niche. So am afraid he could just copy my setup.

2.

I used to work at one of the worlds biggest car auctions my self, 2 of my former co-workers just started their own car auction, with backing from a multi millionaire (from a complete different line of business, he just thought it would be fun to make an auction). They are in the start up face, and are interested in selling my items on their auction, but they dont have any buyers as they are pretty new and their focus is on cars. I could ""easily"" pull my buyers to their platform where i could list my own items, also they would of course offer them to other potential buyers but also private people, the main reason i don't sell to privates my self is because i dont want to deal with them and guarantees. Selling through the auction takes all theese issues away when selling to privates. 

I am thinking about pushing my idea to the ""money-man"" of nr 2, but what would you do? To not have to worry about them ""stealing"" my business, i think i have to be a part owner, but not sure if this is possible if its just part owner for my niche of items, and not cars as they both normally deal with?

1k8yuyq,Startup Marketing Case Study: Coupa (Got acquired for $8 Billion in 2022),"Sharing something I dug up for my '**Startup Marketing**' newsletter this week. In my quest to understand how enterprise products did early stage marketing, I ended up studying Coupa’s early growth and it is a gem if you're trying to crack into a mature market without a big budget.

**First, a little about Coupa:**

* Coupa is a **business spend management platform** — basically, they help big companies manage procurement, expenses, and suppliers.
* They started in 2006, IPO'd in 2016, and were acquired for **$8 Billion** in 2022.
* Coupa entered a market ruled by *giants* like SAP, Oracle, and Ariba... and still won.

Their early stage marketing is worth studying because they broke into a **mature, dominated market** — without raising huge funding rounds or burning millions on ads.

**Their Marketing Strategy**

Coupa’s growth strategy wasn’t to fight incumbents head-on — it was to expand the market. Their goal was to make procurement software accessible to companies of all sizes, especially those that couldn’t afford Oracle or SAP. Procurement software back then was **only** for massive enterprises with big IT budgets.

So they had a simple goal: Get in front of finance and procurement teams who wanted to streamline their purchasing process but lacked the budget or IT capacity for heavyweight solutions.

**Here’s how Coupa pulled it off:**

1. **Launched an open-source version** — almost unheard of in procurement tech at the time.
2. **Built it fast** using Ruby on Rails (lean team, limited resources).
3. **Distributed through SourceForge** — the #1 open-source project platform (500K+ visits/month back then).
4. **Leveraged founder’s reputation** — Dave Stephens (ex-Oracle) ran a popular blog and had deep connections in procurement circles.
5. **Created organic buzz** — early coverage from procurement bloggers (like Spend Matters) and trade publications.

**The impact?**

* 460+ downloads in Month 1.
* 10,000+ downloads in Year 1.
* Built a strong early adopter base before launching their SaaS (paid) version.

Even a modest 10% free-to-paid conversion would have given them \~$1M ARR, as their early ACV was north of $15K.

**Why it worked:**

* Open source killed friction — no huge sales cycles, no approvals needed to try it.
* They expanded the market — making procurement software accessible to smaller companies, not just enterprises.
* And when the paid version dropped, they already had trust and familiarity.

**Fast forward: Coupa went public and eventually got acquired for $8B.**

1k7bxig,I had my wife committed and I am afraid she will leave me,"
My wife (33) and I (34) have been together for 15 years and married for 10 of them. 7 years ago, after our first child, she experienced high anxiety and depression. She was then put on Lexapro by her doctor and seemed to get a lot better.
 3 years ago, she decided she wanted to go back to college. She was nervous because she said she struggled in High School with focusing and such. She went to the doctor and took a ADHD test. She did so badly that she fell in the “learning disability” category. Once medicated, her whole personality changed. The shy, quiet, timid woman I knew was now full of energy, happy, busy, and began what she called “a journey to find who she truly was”. I supported her through all of this. Trying new things, funding her next hyper-fixation project, and so on. 
She killed it in college for 2 years and graduated. She immediately found a job for her field. A month in, I could see it weighing on her. I’ve worked blue collar full time since I was 18 and I wasn’t very sympathetic. However, I still told her that if she needed to quit or do part time, then she absolutely could. She made the decision to push on.
3 weeks ago, her doc switched her from Adderall to Vyvanse for a more even ramp throughout the day. She was speeding. Her hyper-fixations became extremely intense. But I dismissed it thinking that it was just her mind adjusting. 2 weeks later she became delusional. Full on paranoia. Was convinced someone had infiltrated her work computer. She sent $600 to “Miley Cyrus” on messenger to get more money in return? It was a scam. So many different things. 
During all of this she was never suicidal. This made it difficult to mandate help. We would go to a facility and we would walk through the door and she would say she wanted to leave. So we would have to. While searching for help she had stopped taking the meds but the symptoms persisted. In fact, they got worse. Options are so limited around here that it took a week before I could finally get her into a facility to figure out what’s going on. 
Now that she’s in a facility it seems she hates me. Right now, she can’t leave until the doctor clears her. This facility allows her to use the phone, so she calls and begs me to come get her and then gets angry and insults me when I say I can’t. She hasn’t even asked about our daughter, who was her everything before.
I know that what I’m hearing and seeing isn’t really my wife right now, but it hurts so bad. I have my own self-worth/image issues. I’m trying to protect our daughter from seeing any of this. I’m so tired. I’m scared of the road ahead. I’m afraid I’m going to lose the love of my life. My life is falling to pieces. 

UPDATE: Thank you all for the kind words, advice, and support. I don’t have it in me to reply to everyone but know that I’ve read them all so far. She has now been diagnosed with Bipolar and they are in the process of getting her properly medicated. I am also in the works of finding her the best psychotherapist and counselor I can afford, along with a therapist for myself. So much makes more sense now, even as far back as when we met, that seemed just like “quirky” personality traits, granted I’ve even loved those parts of her. We have since talked a couple of times over the phone and the conversations went far better. When she is ready, we will attempt an in-person visit. I don’t want to make things harder on her. I am blessed to have a job that has allowed me all the time off I need. Our daughter is holding strong and looks forward to mommy coming home. I’m staying busy learning all I can about her diagnosis, giving our daughter love and attention, and working on misc. projects my wife has talked about before that we never had time to do.

So we would have to. While searching for help she had stopped taking the meds but the symptoms persisted. In fact, they got worse. Options are so limited around here that it took a week before I could finally get her into a facility to figure out what’s going on. 
Now that she’s in a facility it seems she hates me. Right now, she can’t leave until the doctor clears her. This facility allows her to use the phone, so she calls and begs me to come get her and then gets angry and insults me when I say I can’t. She hasn’t even asked about our daughter, who was her everything before.
I know that what I’m hearing and seeing isn’t really my wife right now, but it hurts so bad. I have my own self-worth/image issues. I’m trying to protect our daughter from seeing any of this. I’m so tired. I’m scared of the road ahead. I’m afraid I’m going to lose the love of my life. My life is falling to pieces. 

UPDATE: Thank you all for the kind words, advice, and support. I don’t have it in me to reply to everyone but know that I’ve read them all so far. She has now been diagnosed with Bipolar and they are in the process of getting her properly medicated. I am also in the works of finding her the best psychotherapist and counselor I can afford, along with a therapist for myself. So much makes more sense now, even as far back as when we met, that seemed just like “quirky” personality traits, granted I’ve even loved those parts of her. We have since talked a couple of times over the phone and the conversations went far better. When she is ready, we will attempt an in-person visit. I don’t want to make things harder on her. I am blessed to have a job that has allowed me all the time off I need. Our daughter is holding strong and looks forward to mommy coming home. I’m staying busy learning all I can about her diagnosis, giving our daughter love and attention, and working on misc. projects my wife has talked about before that we never had time to do. ",i had my wife committed and i am afraid she will leave me my wife and i have been together for years and married for of them years ago after our first child she experienced high anxiety and depression she was then put on lexapro by her doctor and seemed to get a lot better years ago she decided she wanted to go back to college she was nervous because she said she struggled in high school with focusing and such she went to the doctor and took a adhd test she did so badly that she fell in the learning disability category once medicated her whole personality changed the shy quiet timid woman i knew was now full of energy happy busy and began what she called a journey to find who she truly was i supported her through all of this trying new things funding her next hyperfixation project and so on she killed it in college for years and graduated she immediately found a job for her field a month in i could see it weighing on her ive worked blue collar full time since i was and i wasnt very sympathetic however i still told her that if she needed to quit or do part time then she absolutely could she made the decision to push on weeks ago her doc switched her from adderall to vyvanse for a more even ramp throughout the day she was speeding her hyperfixations became extremely intense but i dismissed it thinking that it was just her mind adjusting weeks later she became delusional full on paranoia was convinced someone had infiltrated her work computer she sent to miley cyrus on messenger to get more money in return it was a scam so many different things during all of this she was never suicidal this made it difficult to mandate help we would go to a facility and we would walk through the door and she would say she wanted to leave so we would have to while searching for help she had stopped taking the meds but the symptoms persisted in fact they got worse options are so limited around here that it took a week before i could finally get her into a facility to figure out whats going on now that shes in a facility it seems she hates me right now she cant leave until the doctor clears her this facility allows her to use the phone so she calls and begs me to come get her and then gets angry and insults me when i say i cant she hasnt even asked about our daughter who was her everything before i know that what im hearing and seeing isnt really my wife right now but it hurts so bad i have my own selfworthimage issues im trying to protect our daughter from seeing any of this im so tired im scared of the road ahead im afraid im going to lose the love of my life my life is falling to pieces update thank you all for the kind words advice and support i dont have it in me to reply to everyone but know that ive read them all so far she has now been diagnosed with bipolar and they are in the process of getting her properly medicated i am also in the works of finding her the best psychotherapist and counselor i can afford along with a therapist for myself so much makes more sense now even as far back as when we met that seemed just like quirky personality traits granted ive even loved those parts of her we have since talked a couple of times over the phone and the conversations went far better when she is ready we will attempt an inperson visit i dont want to make things harder on her i am blessed to have a job that has allowed me all the time off i need our daughter is holding strong and looks forward to mommy coming home im staying busy learning all i can about her diagnosis giving our daughter love and attention and working on misc projects my wife has talked about before that we never had time to do,"get, time, wife, year, even",2025-04-25 04:04:34

1k8sax8,Has exercise actually helped anyone mentally?,"
TLDR: has anyone actually had any improvements in their mental health/stress from exercising?

22F here.

To keep things short (ish.. sorry in advance lol) and candid I am going through one of what I would consider to be the actual worst times in my life. I have struggled with my mental health severely since I was a child but I was riding a high for awhile - landed an amazing job in my field, finally somewhat financially stable, and more or less stress free and feeling finally able to properly tackle my mental health and things I had been pushing aside for a time when I was more than just surviving. 

In the past few months however both of my parents have fallen ill. Neither of my parents have worked in years and I have been the main provider (aside from her disability money) for my mom and I since I was around 15 (for added context if it makes a difference my parents are not together and do not live together). I’ve been through a lot and I have grown up fast but nothing has shaken me like having both of my parents so sick at once.

I’m currently out of therapy and waitlisted to get back in and aside from breaking down and dumping all my feelings onto my partner I have no healthy coping mechanisms at the moment. I’ve been smoking weed and consuming disgusting amounts of sugar and take out food - I have gained around 40lbs in the past year or so.

I just wanted to give some context to see if anybody has found solace of any sort in exercise whether for going through rough patches or just managing general mental health struggles. I have heard people say it’s been helpful to them but no personal testimonies or anything that really resonated with me.

Obviously being so overwhelmed, depressed, and now out of shape - going out for a run when I am down just seems like the last thing I would want to do. But at the same time I want my sanity and physical health back because I need it now more than ever.

If you hypothetically met me and wanted to build a relationship with me - would you understand me in this situation, would you accept it?",i left my boyfriend because of illness i met a guy on social networks we were in a relationship for about a month when he admitted to me that he had a very serious illness multiple sclerosis and the truth is that because of this i broke up with him although i really liked him and he was a good person as far as i was concerned i was afraid to take on this responsibility i really want a family children and this fact scared me i was afraid to get attached to him to get pregnant but now i consider myself a really bad person my conscience is gnawing at me and i am also very afraid that my next partner will not understand me if i decide to share this experience because he will consider me an unreliable person for himself i really want to love take care of my loved one build a strong and happy family but now i feel like i have a stigma of being unworthy of a relationship and it oppresses me if you hypothetically met me and wanted to build a relationship with me would you understand me in this situation would you accept it,"really, relationship, person, afraid, illness",2025-04-27 15:37:59

1k6kcxr,"I left my coding school after exposing racism. I’m exhausted, but I know I did the right thing.","Hey everyone, I’m a 29-year-old Black student from France, currently enrolled in a tuition-free coding school that presents itself as inclusive and progressive. On paper, it seemed like the perfect opportunity to grow. In reality, I’ve been dealing with experiences that left me drained — and disappointed.

Here’s just some of what I’ve gone through: •	During a discussion about racism and phrenology, a student turned to me and said: “Do you want me to measure your skull?” It was played off as a joke, but with the historical context of phrenology, it was disturbing and deeply offensive. •	I was mocked using a stereotypical “African” accent in shared spaces. •	Students made “tier lists” ranking women based on their ethnicity, and others ranking people by “race” — openly circulating them within the school. •	A staff member dismissed a racist joke made by his relative, calling it a “clumsy moment” instead of taking it seriously. He did one too and called it the same. « Clumsy followed by nervous laughing » •	My French identity was once questioned in a way that implied I wasn’t “really from here.”

I tried raising these issues through internal channels — calmly, respectfully. And yes, discussions happened. But every time, the pattern was the same: minimizing, shifting the blame, or brushing it off. No visible consequences. No clear stand taken.

Eventually, I spoke out on the school’s Discord. I was banned from the server for 7 days — along with other students — for using “provocative” emojis, and literally for making the problem public  Sure, I was frustrated. But that frustration came from enduring months of none to little action… and hearing that racial tier list thing.

Then came a letter. Not a response. Not a resolution. A lawyer. An obvious attempt to intimidate me — a chilling effect, textbook example. They can’t do much, but wanted to scare me so i stfu.

I haven’t officially left the school yet, but I’m seriously considering it. In the meantime, I’ve already: •	Contacted multiple civil rights organizations •	Spoken with a journalist •	Initiated a report with the French Defender of Rights

I’m sharing this not for pity, but because I know I’m not the only one. If you’ve faced racism or discrimination in your school, in tech, or anywhere else — feel free to share it here. Let’s not keep this stuff in the dark.

I manage to live on my own with two dogs in a great house but how I found my house was simply luck and circumstance. I hold jobs that have paid well but they are all deadend and while they pay well for a young person, they aren’t liveable wages in the long-term and in this last job I’ve worked for four years hasn’t even given me any sort of retirement to work off of

What I guess causes this feeling is the fact that I have no college experience. I have some work into an associates degree but I never pursued further because of how lazy I was when I was younger. As I meet new people, they all have degrees and plan to work 6-figure jobs when they get older and I’m so scared that I’m not going to have that. I fear that my worth as a person is slowly dwindling and I have nothing to show or be proud of for my 25 years of life.

I hold jobs that have paid well but they are all deadend and while they pay well for a young person, they aren’t liveable wages in the long-term and in this last job I’ve worked for four years hasn’t even given me any sort of retirement to work off of

What I guess causes this feeling is the fact that I have no college experience. I have some work into an associates degree but I never pursued further because of how lazy I was when I was younger. As I meet new people, they all have degrees and plan to work 6-figure jobs when they get older and I’m so scared that I’m not going to have that. I fear that my worth as a person is slowly dwindling and I have nothing to show or be proud of for my 25 years of life.

There's five siblings in my family, and my oldest sister constantly describes us all as neurodivergent. I've just never identified with this term, nor neurotypical. I think the two terms are overused, not unlike how people tend to overuse the term ""narcissist/narcissism"" now. I think it also verges on self-contradictory and can be regressive with the way I normally see it being used. My understanding is that it originated to move away from using the terms ""normal"" and ""abnormal,"" but in my opinion those aren't bad words. They just mean ""what typically does/doesn't occur."" They are neutral terms that we need to reclaim the connotation of. But it feels like neurodivergent has been overused to a point where it's become the catch-all for things that are pretty standard human quirks. It's like it's literally become the new ""normal.""

Everyone is different, everyone's brain is unique, and if we're ALL ""neurodivergent,"" as the term is typically used, then 1) none of us are divergent, so 2) what's the point of treating any mental illness?

I have mild dyslexia/dyscalculia and severe anxiety that manifests in obsessive-compulsive tendencies, and these actively prevent me from utilizing the strengths that my unique human brain naturally has, which is contrary to what neurodivergent means. My dyslexia and anxiety don't offer me unique strengths, they hinder me from using the unique strengths I actually have. Does that mean I'm somehow bad for having these issues? No. It means I have a disorder and that is abnormal, and IT'S OKAY TO BE ABNORMAL/HAVE ABNORMALITIES. I would much rather be called abnormal and receive the help I need for being such than have my struggles brushed off as simply being ""neurodivergent"" and therefore somehow fine? I'm NOT fine and I don't want my issues sugarcoated. I have abnormalities, and that is not a moral failing. I need help that other people don't and that is OKAY.

Again, I don't mind if other people want to call themselves neurodivergent, but I wish it wasn't assumed that everyone with a mental illness or disorder wants to be referred to with this term. I understand I'm probably in the minority there, though, so I don't expect it to change. Just venting.

I don’t recognize myself anymore, nothing makes sense, and I have absolutely NOBODY to talk to. I’m not in contact with my family. I live alone with my two cats who I no longer have the energy to care for. 

The only humans I talk to are coworkers during the few hours I work at the office. Outside of work, there is no one I speak to. This isolation is making me sicker and sicker but how can I even begin to look for friends when i’m constantly a fucking wreck? 

I’m a single 31f. I can’t afford my apartment anymore. Rent increases every year and my pay has remained the same. Looking for a higher paying job is a job in itself and i’m battling so many fucking mental/physical symptoms every hour every day I don’t have the capacity to do anything about that. It sounds like an excuse but I genuinely am so unwell….I can’t even finish this sentence due to brain fog. I can’t think. I can’t fucking function. 

Every time I try a new psychiatric med i’m either hit with side effects I can’t push through or they just don’t do anything. I give up on psych meds. What options do I have when all of my issues are “treatment resistant?” I’m desperate for relief and losing my grip with reality. I’d do hard drugs if they’d take the edge off. If they’d help me function just enough to get my life together. I know this isn’t rational thinking. I don’t know how to help myself. 

But something is very wrong with me, I don’t know what’s going on but I legitimately cannot stop sobbing. I go to the bathroom every hour at work to cry. I cry at my desk. I cry anywhere/everywhere. I’m losing my job soon (not related to the crying but bc my boss thinks i’m generally incompetent/incapable due to my health issues). 

I wish I had just ONE person to talk to that tries to understand. I’ve had such bad luck with therapists. They tell you to get help but the quality of help out there leaves so much to be desired. I’m tired of going from psychiatrist to psychiatrist, from therapist to therapist just trying to find someone qualified. If I check myself into the psychward they’ll just put me back on the same stupid meds i’ve tried dozens of times before and watch me for a couple days before sending me on my way. 

I’ve even tried Ketamine (the nasal spray not IV) and that didn’t help. I feel fucked. I don’t know where to get mushrooms from, I hear psilocybin helps some. 

I feel so alone, I AM alone, and it is terrifying watching myself decline this fast. My suicidal ideation has gotten absolutely out of control, I drive over to the same bridge every day but can’t bite.

1k8jqip,Healing from Emotional Manipulation,"Hi everyone,
I’m struggling lately with healing from a relationship where I was manipulated, lied to, and emotionally played with.
Even though I know logically that the person was toxic for me, emotionally it’s been really hard to process everything.
Small things, like him deleting usernames and accounts that once symbolized our relationship, have triggered a lot of unexpected sadness.

I’m struggling lately with healing from a relationship where I was manipulated, lied to, and emotionally played with.
Even though I know logically that the person was toxic for me, emotionally it’s been really hard to process everything.

1k7wou0,Why did I lose my intelligence and potential after taking meds?,"My grandpa was very intelligent—he finished multiple higher schools, some at the top of his class, and was selected for police pyrotechnics (bomb disposal). He was also in the army, worked with cars, and did many jobs. His dad, born around 1917–1918, didn’t go to higher school but was great with tools and cars, doing all kinds of work through the years.

My dad was also top of his class and competed with the best students in the country. He’s very intelligent, good with logic, problem-solving, and social skills—just like my grandpa.

Then there’s me. My family called me a great student when I was younger. I learned English almost fully before age 11–12. But around grade 4, after my parents divorced, I changed and became lazy. At 15–16, I tried to end my life after a breakup and was prescribed risperidone, olanzapine, and some antidepressants.

Years later, I noticed changes. I looked at my old English messages—they were well-written and intelligent. I used to sound like a smart young man. Now I feel much worse. I forget simple things like where I left my keys, and I get blocked trying to do basic math I could easily solve before. I feel like I had a lot of potential but now it’s gone.

What could be the cause? The meds? Life changes? Something else? What happened to me?

TL;DR:
My grandpa and dad were both very smart and successful. I used to be too, until around grade 4. After a breakup at 15–16, I was put on meds like risperidone and olanzapine. Since then, I feel like I’ve lost my intelligence and mental sharpness. What could’ve caused this?

1k55kum,I’m upset with myself for being 25F and letting my teeth get so bad that I’ll need dentures,"This is a whole rant and story behind my teeth (see previous post for pics, but viewer discretion is advised)

I’ve had issues with dental stuff as a kid, but not to this extent. It would be something like multiple cavities filled for too much sugar and improper brushing, even had a tooth break when I was 16 and panicked, but again, my teeth were just yellow but looked beautiful. But now? It didn’t start getting bad until I was 18, since I have been on a pure liquid diet from boost plus drinks alone due to swallowing issues. I drink 4 of them a day to get the nutrients I need to live. I guess all the drinks caused acid in the mouth and it’s been horrible to my teeth the past few years. I’m ashamed of myself since I didn’t think it was that until about a year or 2 ago, and didn’t take better care of my mouth, even tho I’ve always had issues with brushing properly to begin with. 

I would have at least try washing my mouth with water every boost drink to help with the acid level. I’m especially ashamed when my own family thinks my swallowing issues are in my head when I had a pill get stuck in my throat and severely burn my throat. I also have acid reflux since I was about 18 too, which also probably caused this. It just feels like life threw a curve ball at me. I don’t even drink soda all the time, like I did as a kid, and even still, my teeth looked good back then.

For a whole year or two it felt like that pill was still in my throat, and it hurts to swallow foods. The first few days was so bad after I swallowed the pill wrong that I stopped eating entirely, I received nothing but backlash from family about it. I always get triggered when they ask me if I’m “eating anything”, because I know it’s not possible for me, and I hide my teeth from them too cause I know they’d just point out it’s cause of my drinks. Drinking the boost drinks was my last resort since I wasn’t eating and lost 40 lbs from it (160-120), but I’m still alive to this day. 

Even years later, when I tried eating more solid foods, I still feel like something is wrong with my throat, it’s not fair. I know it’s destroying my teeth to be drinking boost, and I’m sure my digestive system too, but my anxiety and physical pain in my throat prevents me from eating. Now even if I wanted to eat, my teeth would just hurt badly and break if I tried. No one understands what it’s like to be in my shoes, to not eat food like everyone else, then be treated like an alien when I enjoy stuff like ranch sauce or cheese sauce, or liquified foods, guacamole with no tomato if I’m feeling brave enough.

1k6lisy,"I was sexually coerced as a young boy and it led me down a dark road, but I always told myself, I gotta keep living to tell my story and HELP THE OTHERS","Hi there 👋

This is my first post. I'll do my best - thanks for taking the time to share this safe space with me.

I was groomed by a male at the church I was at, and ended up with many years of sexual abuse from him.

I'm now male, 36, married to my wife and have 3 children. (My eldest daughter is to another woman, but we see her biweekly)

I think I was 11 when it started, and managed to finally cut ties when I was 16. I never told anyone until I was 34 years old.

This meant I was in a constant state of fight-or-flight, and had a very disturbed and despondent world view, throughout all of my formative years.

I'm lucky that I come from a loving family background - chaos and the Rollercoaster of life, of course, but the foundation was solid.

I did go off the rails and become the black sheep for a while.

At 22 I went through a period of gender dysphoria. The only logical correlation I could make at the time, was that if the younger me had accepted and put up with all of those years of being used as a sex toy, I must be a female in the wrong body. I came out, and spent 6 months in transition, before the bullying and ostracization sent me into a long and dark period of depression.

The dark periods occured across many facets of my life, and still occur to this day.

I was also diagnosed with various MH labels in my early 20s, anxiety, depression, BPD. I went through a period of psychosis, and when I finally started reaching out for help 2 years ago, I was diagnosed with CPTSD. 

These labels were all true in regards to the symptoms, but I rejected them. I didn't want to be defined by a diagnosis label, so I didn't take any of the medications they prescribed. 
I now know that I was subconsciously practicing self sabotage, because I wasn't accepting the diagnosis knowing that I wasn't talking about the abuse I had been through and experienced.

My story is super long and complicated.
I went through drugs, selling my body, hanging with the wrong people. I also went to NA meetings and had a really good ""mask"" when faced with the light of day. I fooled everyone into thinking I was a fun loving, kind guy.

I am, true.

But the amount of trauma and pain I carry, have seen, and continue to work through is insane.

I have an innate need to help people. I like to talk about loving kindness with strangers. Why? Because what we put out we get back. And all I want to see in the universe is loving kindness. So that is my fundamental compass throughout all of this.

I managed to clean up off the drugs and sex scene, and got a career in construction at 23, and just kept my head down for 10 years. This ingrained a lot of disassociative coping mechanisms to keep my mask on straight while my insides boil and sizzle through every moment of the day. The anxiety is insane, and so are the flashbacks. It's very visceral, and I won't bear anyone here the burden of hearing the details.

My need to help people continued to thrive, and I finally met a woman who wanted to carry my child and settle down. The relationship didn't work out, but I was there throughout the pregnancy in best support I could be, and maintain shared parenting arrangements to this day.

Family is very important to me.

I met my wife in Papua New Guinea, and she's back in NZ with me, and we have 2 beautiful children together.

I had a severe TBI 5 months ago, and as I go through rehab, this foundation of pain and trauma are very raw. 

And so I will continue to tell my story.",1745476313.0,7,2,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1k6lisy/i_was_sexually_coerced_as_a_young_boy_and_it_led/,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1k6lisy/i_was_sexually_coerced_as_a_young_boy_and_it_led/,killaak1109,mentalhealth,1.0,True,True,False,False,0,1745839703.621711,Health & Psychology,33,664,682,Thursday,2,April,2025,False,0.9648,0.16,0.139,0.701,positive,"I was sexually coerced as a young boy and it led me down a dark road, but I always told myself, I gotta keep living to tell my story and HELP THE OTHERS","Hi there 👋

I came out, and spent 6 months in transition, before the bullying and ostracization sent me into a long and dark period of depression.

The dark periods occured across many facets of my life, and still occur to this day.

I was also diagnosed with various MH labels in my early 20s, anxiety, depression, BPD. I went through a period of psychosis, and when I finally started reaching out for help 2 years ago, I was diagnosed with CPTSD. 

These labels were all true in regards to the symptoms, but I rejected them. I didn't want to be defined by a diagnosis label, so I didn't take any of the medications they prescribed. 
I now know that I was subconsciously practicing self sabotage, because I wasn't accepting the diagnosis knowing that I wasn't talking about the abuse I had been through and experienced.

My story is super long and complicated.
I went through drugs, selling my body, hanging with the wrong people. I also went to NA meetings and had a really good ""mask"" when faced with the light of day. I fooled everyone into thinking I was a fun loving, kind guy.

I am, true.

But the amount of trauma and pain I carry, have seen, and continue to work through is insane.

I have an innate need to help people. I like to talk about loving kindness with strangers. Why? Because what we put out we get back. And all I want to see in the universe is loving kindness. So that is my fundamental compass throughout all of this.

I managed to clean up off the drugs and sex scene, and got a career in construction at 23, and just kept my head down for 10 years. This ingrained a lot of disassociative coping mechanisms to keep my mask on straight while my insides boil and sizzle through every moment of the day. The anxiety is insane, and so are the flashbacks. It's very visceral, and I won't bear anyone here the burden of hearing the details.

My need to help people continued to thrive, and I finally met a woman who wanted to carry my child and settle down. The relationship didn't work out, but I was there throughout the pregnancy in best support I could be, and maintain shared parenting arrangements to this day.

Family is very important to me.

I met my wife in Papua New Guinea, and she's back in NZ with me, and we have 2 beautiful children together.

I had a severe TBI 5 months ago, and as I go through rehab, this foundation of pain and trauma are very raw. 

And so I will continue to tell my story.",i was sexually coerced as a young boy and it led me down a dark road but i always told myself i gotta keep living to tell my story and help the others hi there this is my first post ill do my best thanks for taking the time to share this safe space with me i was groomed by a male at the church i was at and ended up with many years of sexual abuse from him im now male married to my wife and have children my eldest daughter is to another woman but we see her biweekly i think i was when it started and managed to finally cut ties when i was i never told anyone until i was years old this meant i was in a constant state of fightorflight and had a very disturbed and despondent world view throughout all of my formative years im lucky that i come from a loving family background chaos and the rollercoaster of life of course but the foundation was solid i did go off the rails and become the black sheep for a while at i went through a period of gender dysphoria the only logical correlation i could make at the time was that if the younger me had accepted and put up with all of those years of being used as a sex toy i must be a female in the wrong body i came out and spent months in transition before the bullying and ostracization sent me into a long and dark period of depression the dark periods occured across many facets of my life and still occur to this day i was also diagnosed with various mh labels in my early s anxiety depression bpd i went through a period of psychosis and when i finally started reaching out for help years ago i was diagnosed with cptsd these labels were all true in regards to the symptoms but i rejected them i didnt want to be defined by a diagnosis label so i didnt take any of the medications they prescribed i now know that i was subconsciously practicing self sabotage because i wasnt accepting the diagnosis knowing that i wasnt talking about the abuse i had been through and experienced my story is super long and complicated i went through drugs selling my body hanging with the wrong people i also went to na meetings and had a really good mask when faced with the light of day i fooled everyone into thinking i was a fun loving kind guy i am true but the amount of trauma and pain i carry have seen and continue to work through is insane i have an innate need to help people i like to talk about loving kindness with strangers why because what we put out we get back and all i want to see in the universe is loving kindness so that is my fundamental compass throughout all of this i managed to clean up off the drugs and sex scene and got a career in construction at and just kept my head down for years this ingrained a lot of disassociative coping mechanisms to keep my mask on straight while my insides boil and sizzle through every moment of the day the anxiety is insane and so are the flashbacks its very visceral and i wont bear anyone here the burden of hearing the details my need to help people continued to thrive and i finally met a woman who wanted to carry my child and settle down the relationship didnt work out but i was there throughout the pregnancy in best support i could be and maintain shared parenting arrangements to this day family is very important to me i met my wife in papua new guinea and shes back in nz with me and we have beautiful children together i had a severe tbi months ago and as i go through rehab this foundation of pain and trauma are very raw and so i will continue to tell my story,"year, help, loving, went, period",2025-04-24 06:31:53
1k6j507,I’m constantly bullied every workplace I go,"So I’ll preface by saying my childhood was pretty bad. Suffer cptsd, and was abused in pretty much each way. Over the course of 10-12 years. 

Picked on a bit in high school, but never so badly that I avoided school. I’d usually avoid school for other reasons if possible but anywho. 

I’m now an adult and I get bullied pretty badly, there’s specific things people call me. But it’s done in a weird way. They’ll say it to my face “about this guy who has x,y,z and does this” basically proceeding to describe all my flaws, and then say some realllyyy hurtful shit about “that guy”. Basically puts me in a defenseless position. If I stand up to them I’m essentially A. Taking full ownership of the fucked up things they say, and also they’ve left themselves an out to say “stop acting paranoid I was talking about someone else” 

Irdk what to do, it’s gotten bad, and the theme of bullying seems to be prettyyy consistently the same. As if these these bullies are finding my next place of employment and passing it to them (unrealistic I know) but what they say is way too specific and almost impossible to be a coincidence. This is job #6 that this has happened now. 

I have immense social anxiety from my shit childhood and it’s only getting worse and worse making me an easier target. The more socially I isolate myself, the worse it gets. I just want to be able to work, make money, feed my small family, and have some sort of success.

1k6di9z,I opened up to my my boyfriend and I’m fucking terrified,"Okay just some context to start
So me and my boyfriend have been together just shy of a year and a half. And I’ve been very open with him about my past attempts, and I had (to a point) moved past them and had started to get finally better mentally. Then I dropped out of college, and can’t find a job, and lost all of my friends + some other stuff in the family and it’s honestly getting too much and I’ve been slipping into that mindset again. 

And so I told him, more for transparency than the need for him to know. I won’t do it, I have too much to live for and too many people who would be devastated if anything happened to me. But I value honesty above everything else in all types of relationships and so I told him. He was so sweet about it. He just held me and let me cry it out then told me he’ll always be there when I need him, and to call him if it ever gets too bad. 

But he’s had friends in the past do that vent to him for hours about their own suicidal thoughts with no regard for what he might have been going through, and it really affects him even today. And my fear is he’ll go back into his mindset he had during those time with those people and it’ll get too much for him. 
I need his support but I know he can’t pour from an empty cup and I’m so so scared that this will cause problems for him/us.

1k93f2j,I feel that my wife disrespects and doesn't appreciate me,"First of all, let me just say that I love my wife so much, it's just that most of the time I feel like I am getting disrespected and unappreciated,  and that is leading me to think twice about our marriage.

My wife (48 F) and I (41 M) are mostly ok and do what normal couples do (go on dates, be sweet to each other, be each other's confidants, etc). But there are times that i feel so unappreciated or disrespected. Here are some examples:
- I talk about my day and I don't see any genuine interest in her. She just stays quiet and then suddenly talks about something about herself or her day or her issues, like she wasn't even listening to a thing i just said.
- There are times she just gets angry for just about anything. Like how the other day, I was cleaning our car and she tells me to clean the electric fan as well, and I tell her ""yeah, I'll just finish this one."" After that she ignores me the whole morning. And when i ask her about it, she tells me how I am not doing enough at home, when I just literally prepared our lunch, cleaned the car, cleaned the house, did a little gardening, and yeah, cleaned the electric fan. And I was doing this despite me having a backache due to my Lumbar Lordosis. 
- When I talk to her and ask her about something or say something she doesn't like, she just goes all sarcastic or worse, just outright berates me.
- And when we fight, she tells me to leave her alone. Now when I do this, she gets more angry and tells me that I don't care anymore. I mean, WTH.

I think this is because she is too comfortable with me that she thinks I'm ok with just about everything, but the truth is I just want to scream at the top of my lungs and just tell her enough is enough, but I know if I do that It'll lead to another fight and even if I try to explain my side, it'll just end up with her blaming me for everything.

Whether I was hyped, angry, sad, chill, didn’t matter. I could always rely on them. Chester Bennington and Mike Shinoda had this insane energy that somehow matched whatever I was feeling at the time.

Songs like In the End, Crawling, Numb, Somewhere I Belong, Breaking the Habit, and Bleed It Out were basically the soundtrack to everything:

Workouts? Linkin Park.

Parties? Linkin Park.

School days? Linkin Park.

Late night drives? Definitely Linkin Park.

Bad days? Especially Linkin Park.


It was like they built a world where you could just exist in your emotions without apology.

But after Chester’s death, everything changed for me. Now when I hear his voice, it's like all the battles I've fought, or am still fighting, come roaring back to the surface. His voice isn't just music anymore. It's a reminder of pain. Of struggles that don’t always show on the outside.

It's happened 4 times in the last 2 years. The most recent one being today I've been sent to because the other 3 aren't Specialist enough has done fuck all.

1k6qq02,Feeling mentally drunk and foggy for 2 months.,"Hey folks,  
I'm a 20-year-old man. For the past 2 months I've been feeling like my brain is running on fumes. It's hard to describe, but it's like I'm constantly in a weird mental fog, almost like I had two beers. Just slightly off, sluggish, and disconnected.

My focus is shot. I can read something and forget what it said immediately. Driving feels unreal sometimes. My vision feels slightly worse, like I have to really focus to make my eyes ""work right"". Not blurry, just... slow to respond?

Sleep doesn't seem to matter much. I can sleep 9 hours or 5, and I wake up feeling the same – groggy, unmotivated, and slow. My diet is okay-ish, normal home-cooked meals, nothing crazy. I rarely drink coffee. It doesn't really matter if I drink it - I'll just be sitting ""high on caffeine"" and not do anything productive.

I’ve also noticed it’s getting harder to motivate myself to do anything, even fun stuff I used to enjoy.  
I can't even think about anything that could put me in any kind of stress. 

I’m starting to wonder if it’s something deeper, low vitamins, thyroid issues, something neurological? I’ll probably go for some bloodwork soon, but in the meantime I’d love to hear from anyone who went through something similar.  
What should I be looking into?

1k66pp9,Talking out loud helped me more than I ever expected,"I’ve tried therapy (couldn’t afford to keep going), journaling (felt like a chore), meditation (never really clicked). What finally helped? Just… talking. Out loud. Into my phone.

I started recording voice notes when I felt anxious, overwhelmed, angry whatever I was feeling in the moment. No structure, no script. Just venting into the void. Weird thing is it works.  
It’s like my brain starts making sense of itself once I say things out loud. I don’t spiral as hard. I notice patterns. I feel heard, even if no one’s listening.

I found an app that lets me do this daily it even sorts by emotion and saves my “sessions.” Honestly, it’s done more for my mental clarity than anything else I’ve tried in years.

Just wanted to share in case someone else out there is stuck and needs something that feels doable. No pressure, no audience, no cost per session.

I started recording voice notes when I felt anxious, overwhelmed, angry whatever I was feeling in the moment. No structure, no script. Just venting into the void. Weird thing is it works.  
It’s like my brain starts making sense of itself once I say things out loud. I don’t spiral as hard. I notice patterns. I feel heard, even if no one’s listening.

I found an app that lets me do this daily it even sorts by emotion and saves my “sessions.” Honestly, it’s done more for my mental clarity than anything else I’ve tried in years.

Just wanted to share in case someone else out there is stuck and needs something that feels doable. No pressure, no audience, no cost per session.

1k76nen,my parents are kicking my sister out and even if it's justified i'm sad.,"before i start, it is justified. they're not even kicking her out, they're going to give her until october to find a new job and a place. she doesn't know it yet.

she's been mentally abusing them and our family for years and years. she's sick, not the depressed sick, she was diagnosed with bipolarity at some point but then said doctors were wrong and she wasn't, so she stopped her meds. but to me it's probably something more like personality disorder, we won't know because she refuses to see anyone.

one day she threw away 100$ worth of food even though we struggle financially, because she didn't want us to eat things she wasn't allowing herself to eat. she was on a diet to loose weight and because of that we couldn't eat anything that wasn't vegetables. we had to put locks on the fridge. locks.  

our father had a cancer scare last year because he lost so much weight doctors were in alerts, turns out it's depression that wore him down. he's nearing 70 and sometimes i'm so scared for their health. 

my mom keeps crying because she can't deal with my sister's outbursts anymore. she's mostly the target, every-time there is something wrong it's because of our mom she says, ""a bad mom"" ""a toxic mom"" ""selfish"" ""manipulator"" and it keeps going, yelling, yelling, yelling. she's so great with words that she will hurt anyone deeply with them. 

our parents were never perfect but who can say they have perfect parents? our dad is ex military so he was not extra feelings with us as a kid but he's always been a great dad. our mom had so much problems with her family she didnt grow up to be a huggey mother either, neither was her mom, so yes we're 4 daughters but maybe she needed more attention than they could provide. but it doesn't justify the hell she's put them through for years. 

i could list the tons of things they did for her. but she forgets them, when you mentions it she doesn't remember them. only the bad, she extrapolate reality too, lies, distort, assume things are happening when they're not, she gets paranoid. 

once told me she wanted to hurt people the way they hurt her. i will always remember how dark her eyes were that day. that's the first time i felt uneasy.  

i'm sad because i don't know if she'll live long, she said she attempted s**cide once or twice before and she came back home a decade ago because she was living alone in her apartment and was ""this close to hanging herself"" she said. i know she can't live alone, that's why she's here with us at 38. i know. and our uncle was like her before he died at 40-50 ish. despite it all i don't want her to die, not like that. not so young.

she's been mentally abusing them and our family for years and years. she's sick, not the depressed sick, she was diagnosed with bipolarity at some point but then said doctors were wrong and she wasn't, so she stopped her meds. but to me it's probably something more like personality disorder, we won't know because she refuses to see anyone.

one day she threw away 100$ worth of food even though we struggle financially, because she didn't want us to eat things she wasn't allowing herself to eat. she was on a diet to loose weight and because of that we couldn't eat anything that wasn't vegetables. we had to put locks on the fridge. locks.  

our father had a cancer scare last year because he lost so much weight doctors were in alerts, turns out it's depression that wore him down. he's nearing 70 and sometimes i'm so scared for their health. 

my mom keeps crying because she can't deal with my sister's outbursts anymore. she's mostly the target, every-time there is something wrong it's because of our mom she says, ""a bad mom"" ""a toxic mom"" ""selfish"" ""manipulator"" and it keeps going, yelling, yelling, yelling. she's so great with words that she will hurt anyone deeply with them. 

our parents were never perfect but who can say they have perfect parents? our dad is ex military so he was not extra feelings with us as a kid but he's always been a great dad. our mom had so much problems with her family she didnt grow up to be a huggey mother either, neither was her mom, so yes we're 4 daughters but maybe she needed more attention than they could provide. but it doesn't justify the hell she's put them through for years. 

i could list the tons of things they did for her. but she forgets them, when you mentions it she doesn't remember them. only the bad, she extrapolate reality too, lies, distort, assume things are happening when they're not, she gets paranoid. 

once told me she wanted to hurt people the way they hurt her. i will always remember how dark her eyes were that day. that's the first time i felt uneasy.  

i'm sad because i don't know if she'll live long, she said she attempted s**cide once or twice before and she came back home a decade ago because she was living alone in her apartment and was ""this close to hanging herself"" she said. i know she can't live alone, that's why she's here with us at 38. i know. and our uncle was like her before he died at 40-50 ish. despite it all i don't want her to die, not like that. not so young.  

i also know we'll never see her again. the only reason we can reach her right now is because she lives with us, she cut contact with everyone. she barely use her phone. she'll be so mad at them for this decision that she'll pack her things and go and never look back. i know her.

CHEECH & CHONG’S LAST MOVIE – Exclusively in Theaters Friday 4/25 🥦

In the 1970s, Cheech & Chong redefined stand-up comedy, blending drugs, sex, rock’n’roll, and improvisation into a genre-shaping act.

Join them for one last ride to find out... and bring a bud!

1k7kl56,I rewatched all of Tom Cruise’s films from Endless Love (1981) to Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning (2023) and ranked the 295 running moments in his filmography.,"Earlier this year, in anticipation of the release of [*Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning*](https://youtu.be/fsQgc9pCyDU), I decided to rank all of Tom Cruise’s running scenes in the *M:I* franchise. I’d worked on several *M:*I data pieces for various companies and figured it would be easy to rank the 100ish running moments. When the list was completed - it felt incomplete, so I decided to rank all of the running scenes in his filmography. Starting with 1981’s *Endless Love*, and finishing with 2023's *Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning*. Cruise had gone to extreme lengths for his films, so I decided to honor his hard work by putting together this absurd list.

**Quick note** \- His X handle always makes me laugh

https://preview.redd.it/nipy05v8czwe1.png?width=762&format=png&auto=webp&s=98ad8d85fd8050287ab4770953933c0844f559f1

Here’s what you need to know about the list:

* I found and ranked 295 moments 
* I counted running, sprinting and jogging. The amount of time doesn’t matter either. In *Top Gun* there’s a one-second shot of [him running to hit a volleyball](https://youtu.be/okyLAKclleo). It was included. 
* A short blurb was included for list items 295 - 26
* Timestamps have been included for the top 25. Some of the timestamps may be a little off for you. It depends on where/how you watch the movies. For me, it was a mixture of DVDs, Blu-rays, Vudu and streaming channels. 
* I researched the top 10 scenes and wrote more about them (and included YouTube links)
* This list is obviously subjective, but after going through Cruise’s filmography for the fourth time since 2018, I am very happy with the top 10
* There is zero chance that our lists will match up, so don’t be surprised if the 295 moments don’t line up with your list. 
* For some of the scenes, I split them up into moments. I just went with the flow of the scene and if he stops for a moment or the scene cuts to someone else - I split up the running moment into parts. 
* If you’re interested in learning more about the top 10 and this list, I recorded a podcast episode about the  data collection and ranking process. It’s fun. You should listen to it. The podcast is called [*Movies, Films and Flix*](https://www.spreaker.com/episode/bonus-episode-the-tom-cruise-running-special--65723787) \- you can find it wherever you listen to podcasts. I also have a show called *Deep Blue Sea - The Podcast* that you should listen to as well.

**Top 25!**



25. *Collateral* \- Subway running followed by a beautiful jump - Dude is pissed. - 01:46:10

24. *The Mummy* \- “Slip in, slip out. Just like we always do.” Then it cuts to them being shot at whilst running away. - 00:10:15

23. *Mission: Impossible - Fallout* \- Keep going straight? - He runs into an office building and smashes a window. 01:34:53

22. *Mission: Impossible - Fallout* \- Why is he running in a circle? Great overhead shot of cruise sprinting up stairs, losing the goons, and running around the upper floors of the cathedral. - 01:32:59

21. *Mission: Impossible - Fallout* \- Roof running and two amazing jumps. - 01:33:48

20. *Mission: Impossible - Fallout* \- During the bathroom fight Hunt runs at a guy and slams him through a wall. Great stuff. I love how he really doesn’t want to do it. - 00:32:38

19. *Minority Repor*t - Runs up to the house and has to stop a potential murder. - 00:15:28:00

18. *Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol* \- Runs away from the Burj Khalifa - Looks awesome. Brad Bird shoots it from every angle. I love how the camera looks up at him.

17. *Mission: Impossible - Fallout* \- “Ethan he’s getting away from you, you’re going to have to go faster! - Cruise absolutely books it during a roof run that ends with the jump that broke his foot. Epic. - 01:34:20

16. *Jerry Maguire* \- Airport running. - 02:06:05

15. *Mission: Impossible II* \- He runs in slow motion so he can jump out of a building - Wonderful - 01:25:58 - He also runs while holding two guns (and shooting them at the same time). Awesome hair work

14. *Risky Business* \- He takes a drunk guy out of a train and runs back into it. - 01:20:45 

13. *Days of Thunder* \- He races Robert Duvall - It’s a good time. 01:42:54

12. *War of the Worlds* \- Cruise runs away from the aliens. Amazing scene. - The aliens are silly for thinking they can blow Cruise up. Dude has ash all over his face. - 00:26:29

11. *Collateral* \- Runs out of a hospital and across an overpass. When he starts running I don’t think he'll ever look faster on screen. - 00:52:25

  


**10.** ***Edge of Tomorrow*** \- “Arrest this man.” - In an all-timer Cruise moment, he tries to escape arrest and It ends badly - 00:07:58 - [YouTube Clip](https://youtu.be/EO4Mt9DDV-Q) 

Moments before Brendan Gleeson’s character yells “Arrest this man,” Tom Cruise delivers an all-timer Cruise moment in which this dialogue is delivered:

“I just inspired millions of people to join your army. And when the body bags come home and they’re looking for someone to blame, how hard do you think it would be for me to convince people to blame you? I’d imagine the general would prefer to avoid that.”

Cruise enters Gleeson’s office with total confidence and he quickly becomes a slimy rat whose escape attempt ends quickly. It’s perfect and it makes his heroic transformation more interesting. Director Doug Liman did a great job weaponizing Cruise’s charm in this scene, and It’s fun watching a guy who can’t escape an office building becoming a world-saving soldier.



**9.** ***The Firm*** \- The final chase scene. He runs, jumps, goes up steps and this is when we get to see his true breakaway speed AND he’s holding a briefcase. 02:12:23 - [YouTube Clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0vCzkK_AJ0&pp=ygUUVGhlIGZpcm0gY2hhc2Ugc2NlbmU%3D) 

*The Firm* is Cruise’s first film to fully showcase his soon-to-be-famous running form (elbows and knees). We get a glimpse of it at the 68-minute mark when he’s chasing down Jeannie Tripplehorn. But, it’s not until the climactic chase that we see his breakaway speed for several minutes as he’s running away from Tobin “Jigsaw” Bell. 



**8.** ***Far and Away*** \- In a neat transition,  Cruise starts running so fast that the next shot is of an explosion. Talk about explosive running.  01:40:13 - [YouTube Clip](https://youtu.be/NajSnF9AspA) 

I love how Ron Howard cuts from a sprinting Tom Cruise to an explosion. It’s silly and it always puts a smile on my face. I also love that the movie ends with the Land Run of 1893. 



**7.** ***Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation*** \- Cruise wipes out while trying to jump over a car. It is very funny and the MI score helps make it better - 01:12:58 - [YouTube Clip](https://youtu.be/WK8X6m_wEbg) 

“This is *Mission: Impossible*, I can’t just cross a street and get in a car.” - McQuarrie talking about a conversation he had with Cruise on the *Rogue Nation* commentary. 

When putting together the top 10 I always knew that this three-second moment would be included. It’s a silly moment punctuated by cheeky musical accompaniment and it proves that Cruise doesn’t take himself seriously. It’s made even better by the knowledge that Cruise came up with this bit on the day and he surprised the crew with his ill-fated car jump. Also, the ensuing dialogue (What are you talking about?) is delightful. At this point in his career, Cruise was on a hot streak and it’s fun knowing that he was still totally down to make himself look like a dork.  



**6.** ***Mission: Impossible - Fallout*** \- Iconic run across the building punctuated by a beautiful tracking shot - Dude looks amazing and he almost catches Cavill - 01:36:25 - [YouTube Clip](https://youtu.be/Sjn3ELLcy2U)

“I loved doing this, but it hurt.” - Tom Cruise - *Fallout* Blu-ray commentary. 

Watching Cruise run across The Blackfriars Railway bridge is an all-timer Cruise moment for multiple reasons. 

* It looks great and is a perfect trailer moment
* “I’m jumping out of a window.” - Great line - I love the reaction he gets from the people in the office. They 
* Tom was still recovering from the ankle break he suffered during a jump gone awry
* Director Christopher McQuarrie said - “He was going for it.”
* The score rules
* It’s a bit gratuitous but the running makes sense in regards to the story.



**5**. ***Mission: Impossible*** \- Cruise runs from an exploding restaurant and does his first “I look awesome while running in an action film” work. - 31:59 - Lots of fish die….. [YouTube Clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8HHeT4Eo6A&pp=ygUiTWlzc2lvbiBpbXBvc3NpYmxlIGZpc2ggcmVzdGF1cmFudNIHCQl-CQGHKiGM7w%3D%3D)

That one was particularly very crazy - Talking about the scene on The Graham Norton Show

Tom Cruise was already a big star in 1996, but this moment made him a gigantic “action movie” star. He had been in *Top Gun* (sitting in a plane), *Legend* (lots of rolling and crouch running), Days of Thunder (*more sitting*), Far and Away (*boxing*), and *The Outsiders* (fisticuffs), but *Mission: Impossible* saw him entering a new phase of his career. This moment was everywhere in 1996 and it’s one of the most iconic images of the *Mission: Impossible* franchise. It gets added points because the stunt looks legitimately dangerous and features some solid arm work from Tom. 



**4.** ***Risky Business*** \- A cigarette-smoking Cruise (wearing sunglasses at night) runs up to some teenagers while the song “Mannish Boy” plays on the soundtrack This is the moment when Cruise became Tom Cruise - 01:07:26 - [YouTube Clip](https://youtu.be/adZvM19Qnb0) (starts at 53 seconds)

Wearing a suit coat, black shirt, black sunglasses and puffing on a cigarette, Cruise is strutting down the street and runs up to a group of classmates. The moment lasts only seven seconds,  but it’s a turning point for Cruise. Also, the song selection is perfect. 



**3.** ***Vanilla Sky*** \- Cruise runs through an empty Times Square - 00:03:37 - [YouTube Clip](https://youtu.be/-kNdNC-2wPU)

The groundwork for the Times Square running in *Vanilla Sky* was set up in the 1996 film *Jerry Maguire*. In the Cameron Crowe-directed movie, Cruise dramatically runs through an airport -  and it looks great. Years later, while filming *Vanilla Sky*, Crowe and Cruise pulled some strings with the city of New York and were able to close down Times Square for three hours on a Sunday morning in November. The idea was that Cruise’s character hates being alone, and he dreams that he’s alone in one of the busiest places in the world. It’s total vanity, but I love that Cruise has a running scene in an empty Times Square. 



**2.** ***Collateral*** \- He throws a chair through a glass window, then WIPES out on the chair and just keeps running. It’s his most aggressive running ever. - 01:44:50 -[ YouTube Clip (starts at 2:37)](https://youtu.be/_pTzb4rl5Y8)

*Collatera*l not only features the best sitting performance of Tom Cruise’s career, it also features his most aggressive running. Tom’s character Vincent is a straight-up killer and it’s fun watching Cruise as he fully commits to being a coyote who chases down his prey with lightning-fast footwork. There’s a moment towards the end when Vincent is chasing down Max and Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith - running in heels), and he takes a chair to smash a window so he can run through it. However, Cruise mistimed/misjudged the chair’s trajectory and he WIPED out on the chair and fell to the ground. The neat thing is that he springs up immediately and keeps running. It’s a perfect showcase for Cruise’s tenacity and toughness and I love that the unplanned moment made its way into the film - and so does Mann who felt like it added to the realism of *Collateral*. It’s a seconds-long moment, but I love that nothing can stop Cruise from running. 



**1.** ***Mission: Impossible III*** \- Cruise runs across some rooftops and then he SPRINTS through a Shanghai fishing village - 01:44:10 - [YouTube Clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOqV-jDl0h8&pp=ygUhbWlzc2lvbiBpbXBvc3NpYmxlIDMgc2hhbmdoYWkgcnVu0gcJCX4JAYcqIYzv)

In 2006, Cruise had been running in movies for 20+ years and had some memorable sprints in *War of the Worlds, The Firm, Minority Report, Collatera*l, and *Far and Away*. However, his sprinting in *M:I 3* (which took 6-7 takes to get perfect) made people sit up and realize they were witnessing cinematic running history. It’s the fastest Cruise has ever looked, and the spidercam rig that was built for the scene works perfectly as it tracks alongside Cruise as he damn near goes plaid on the Shanghai sidewalks. During the Blu-ray commentary, director J.J. Abrams says “I loved watching you run” to Cruise, and I totally agree. It’s apex Tom Cruise running.

I’d worked on several *M:*I data pieces for various companies and figured it would be easy to rank the 100ish running moments. When the list was completed - it felt incomplete, so I decided to rank all of the running scenes in his filmography. Starting with 1981’s *Endless Love*, and finishing with 2023's *Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning*. Cruise had gone to extreme lengths for his films, so I decided to honor his hard work by putting together this absurd list.

**Quick note** \- His X handle always makes me laugh

https://preview.redd.it/nipy05v8czwe1.png?width=762&format=png&auto=webp&s=98ad8d85fd8050287ab4770953933c0844f559f1

Here’s what you need to know about the list:

* I found and ranked 295 moments 
* I counted running, sprinting and jogging. The amount of time doesn’t matter either. In *Top Gun* there’s a one-second shot of [him running to hit a volleyball](https://youtu.be/okyLAKclleo). It was included. 
* A short blurb was included for list items 295 - 26
* Timestamps have been included for the top 25. Some of the timestamps may be a little off for you. It depends on where/how you watch the movies. For me, it was a mixture of DVDs, Blu-rays, Vudu and streaming channels. 
* I researched the top 10 scenes and wrote more about them (and included YouTube links)
* This list is obviously subjective, but after going through Cruise’s filmography for the fourth time since 2018, I am very happy with the top 10
* There is zero chance that our lists will match up, so don’t be surprised if the 295 moments don’t line up with your list. 
* For some of the scenes, I split them up into moments. I just went with the flow of the scene and if he stops for a moment or the scene cuts to someone else - I split up the running moment into parts. 
* If you’re interested in learning more about the top 10 and this list, I recorded a podcast episode about the  data collection and ranking process. It’s fun. You should listen to it. The podcast is called [*Movies, Films and Flix*](https://www.spreaker.com/episode/bonus-episode-the-tom-cruise-running-special--65723787) \- you can find it wherever you listen to podcasts. I also have a show called *Deep Blue Sea - The Podcast* that you should listen to as well.

**Top 25!**



25. *Collateral* \- Subway running followed by a beautiful jump - Dude is pissed. - 01:46:10

24. *The Mummy* \- “Slip in, slip out. Just like we always do.” Then it cuts to them being shot at whilst running away. - 00:10:15

23. *Mission: Impossible - Fallout* \- Keep going straight? - He runs into an office building and smashes a window. 01:34:53

22. *Mission: Impossible - Fallout* \- Why is he running in a circle? Great overhead shot of cruise sprinting up stairs, losing the goons, and running around the upper floors of the cathedral. - 01:32:59

21. *Mission: Impossible - Fallout* \- Roof running and two amazing jumps. - 01:33:48

20. *Mission: Impossible - Fallout* \- During the bathroom fight Hunt runs at a guy and slams him through a wall. Great stuff. I love how he really doesn’t want to do it. - 00:32:38

19. *Minority Repor*t - Runs up to the house and has to stop a potential murder. - 00:15:28:00

18. *Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol* \- Runs away from the Burj Khalifa - Looks awesome. Brad Bird shoots it from every angle. I love how the camera looks up at him.

17. *Mission: Impossible - Fallout* \- “Ethan he’s getting away from you, you’re going to have to go faster! - Cruise absolutely books it during a roof run that ends with the jump that broke his foot. Epic. - 01:34:20

16. *Jerry Maguire* \- Airport running. - 02:06:05

15. *Mission: Impossible II* \- He runs in slow motion so he can jump out of a building - Wonderful - 01:25:58 - He also runs while holding two guns (and shooting them at the same time). Awesome hair work

14. *Risky Business* \- He takes a drunk guy out of a train and runs back into it. - 01:20:45 

13. *Days of Thunder* \- He races Robert Duvall - It’s a good time. 01:42:54

12. *War of the Worlds* \- Cruise runs away from the aliens. Amazing scene. - The aliens are silly for thinking they can blow Cruise up. Dude has ash all over his face. - 00:26:29

11. *Collateral* \- Runs out of a hospital and across an overpass. When he starts running I don’t think he'll ever look faster on screen. - 00:52:25

  


**10.** ***Edge of Tomorrow*** \- “Arrest this man.” - In an all-timer Cruise moment, he tries to escape arrest and It ends badly - 00:07:58 - [YouTube Clip](https://youtu.be/EO4Mt9DDV-Q) 

Moments before Brendan Gleeson’s character yells “Arrest this man,” Tom Cruise delivers an all-timer Cruise moment in which this dialogue is delivered:

“I just inspired millions of people to join your army. And when the body bags come home and they’re looking for someone to blame, how hard do you think it would be for me to convince people to blame you? I’d imagine the general would prefer to avoid that.”

Cruise enters Gleeson’s office with total confidence and he quickly becomes a slimy rat whose escape attempt ends quickly. It’s perfect and it makes his heroic transformation more interesting. Director Doug Liman did a great job weaponizing Cruise’s charm in this scene, and It’s fun watching a guy who can’t escape an office building becoming a world-saving soldier.



**9.** ***The Firm*** \- The final chase scene. He runs, jumps, goes up steps and this is when we get to see his true breakaway speed AND he’s holding a briefcase. 02:12:23 - [YouTube Clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0vCzkK_AJ0&pp=ygUUVGhlIGZpcm0gY2hhc2Ugc2NlbmU%3D) 

*The Firm* is Cruise’s first film to fully showcase his soon-to-be-famous running form (elbows and knees). We get a glimpse of it at the 68-minute mark when he’s chasing down Jeannie Tripplehorn. But, it’s not until the climactic chase that we see his breakaway speed for several minutes as he’s running away from Tobin “Jigsaw” Bell. 



**8.** ***Far and Away*** \- In a neat transition,  Cruise starts running so fast that the next shot is of an explosion. Talk about explosive running.  01:40:13 - [YouTube Clip](https://youtu.be/NajSnF9AspA) 

I love how Ron Howard cuts from a sprinting Tom Cruise to an explosion. It’s silly and it always puts a smile on my face. I also love that the movie ends with the Land Run of 1893. 



**7.** ***Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation*** \- Cruise wipes out while trying to jump over a car. It is very funny and the MI score helps make it better - 01:12:58 - [YouTube Clip](https://youtu.be/WK8X6m_wEbg) 

“This is *Mission: Impossible*, I can’t just cross a street and get in a car.” - McQuarrie talking about a conversation he had with Cruise on the *Rogue Nation* commentary. 

When putting together the top 10 I always knew that this three-second moment would be included. It’s a silly moment punctuated by cheeky musical accompaniment and it proves that Cruise doesn’t take himself seriously. It’s made even better by the knowledge that Cruise came up with this bit on the day and he surprised the crew with his ill-fated car jump. Also, the ensuing dialogue (What are you talking about?) is delightful. At this point in his career, Cruise was on a hot streak and it’s fun knowing that he was still totally down to make himself look like a dork.  



**6.** ***Mission: Impossible - Fallout*** \- Iconic run across the building punctuated by a beautiful tracking shot - Dude looks amazing and he almost catches Cavill - 01:36:25 - [YouTube Clip](https://youtu.be/Sjn3ELLcy2U)

“I loved doing this, but it hurt.” - Tom Cruise - *Fallout* Blu-ray commentary. 

Watching Cruise run across The Blackfriars Railway bridge is an all-timer Cruise moment for multiple reasons. 

* It looks great and is a perfect trailer moment
* “I’m jumping out of a window.” - Great line - I love the reaction he gets from the people in the office. They 
* Tom was still recovering from the ankle break he suffered during a jump gone awry
* Director Christopher McQuarrie said - “He was going for it.”
* The score rules
* It’s a bit gratuitous but the running makes sense in regards to the story.



**5**. ***Mission: Impossible*** \- Cruise runs from an exploding restaurant and does his first “I look awesome while running in an action film” work. - 31:59 - Lots of fish die….. [YouTube Clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8HHeT4Eo6A&pp=ygUiTWlzc2lvbiBpbXBvc3NpYmxlIGZpc2ggcmVzdGF1cmFudNIHCQl-CQGHKiGM7w%3D%3D)

That one was particularly very crazy - Talking about the scene on The Graham Norton Show

Tom Cruise was already a big star in 1996, but this moment made him a gigantic “action movie” star. He had been in *Top Gun* (sitting in a plane), *Legend* (lots of rolling and crouch running), Days of Thunder (*more sitting*), Far and Away (*boxing*), and *The Outsiders* (fisticuffs), but *Mission: Impossible* saw him entering a new phase of his career. This moment was everywhere in 1996 and it’s one of the most iconic images of the *Mission: Impossible* franchise. It gets added points because the stunt looks legitimately dangerous and features some solid arm work from Tom. 



**4.** ***Risky Business*** \- A cigarette-smoking Cruise (wearing sunglasses at night) runs up to some teenagers while the song “Mannish Boy” plays on the soundtrack This is the moment when Cruise became Tom Cruise - 01:07:26 - [YouTube Clip](https://youtu.be/adZvM19Qnb0) (starts at 53 seconds)

Wearing a suit coat, black shirt, black sunglasses and puffing on a cigarette, Cruise is strutting down the street and runs up to a group of classmates. The moment lasts only seven seconds,  but it’s a turning point for Cruise. Also, the song selection is perfect. 



**3.** ***Vanilla Sky*** \- Cruise runs through an empty Times Square - 00:03:37 - [YouTube Clip](https://youtu.be/-kNdNC-2wPU)

The groundwork for the Times Square running in *Vanilla Sky* was set up in the 1996 film *Jerry Maguire*. In the Cameron Crowe-directed movie, Cruise dramatically runs through an airport -  and it looks great. Years later, while filming *Vanilla Sky*, Crowe and Cruise pulled some strings with the city of New York and were able to close down Times Square for three hours on a Sunday morning in November. The idea was that Cruise’s character hates being alone, and he dreams that he’s alone in one of the busiest places in the world. It’s total vanity, but I love that Cruise has a running scene in an empty Times Square. 



**2.** ***Collateral*** \- He throws a chair through a glass window, then WIPES out on the chair and just keeps running. It’s his most aggressive running ever. - 01:44:50 -[ YouTube Clip (starts at 2:37)](https://youtu.be/_pTzb4rl5Y8)

*Collatera*l not only features the best sitting performance of Tom Cruise’s career, it also features his most aggressive running. Tom’s character Vincent is a straight-up killer and it’s fun watching Cruise as he fully commits to being a coyote who chases down his prey with lightning-fast footwork. There’s a moment towards the end when Vincent is chasing down Max and Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith - running in heels), and he takes a chair to smash a window so he can run through it. However, Cruise mistimed/misjudged the chair’s trajectory and he WIPED out on the chair and fell to the ground. The neat thing is that he springs up immediately and keeps running. It’s a perfect showcase for Cruise’s tenacity and toughness and I love that the unplanned moment made its way into the film - and so does Mann who felt like it added to the realism of *Collateral*. It’s a seconds-long moment, but I love that nothing can stop Cruise from running. 



**1.** ***Mission: Impossible III*** \- Cruise runs across some rooftops and then he SPRINTS through a Shanghai fishing village - 01:44:10 - [YouTube Clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOqV-jDl0h8&pp=ygUhbWlzc2lvbiBpbXBvc3NpYmxlIDMgc2hhbmdoYWkgcnVu0gcJCX4JAYcqIYzv)

In 2006, Cruise had been running in movies for 20+ years and had some memorable sprints in *War of the Worlds, The Firm, Minority Report, Collatera*l, and *Far and Away*. However, his sprinting in *M:I 3* (which took 6-7 takes to get perfect) made people sit up and realize they were witnessing cinematic running history. It’s the fastest Cruise has ever looked, and the spidercam rig that was built for the scene works perfectly as it tracks alongside Cruise as he damn near goes plaid on the Shanghai sidewalks. During the Blu-ray commentary, director J.J. Abrams says “I loved watching you run” to Cruise, and I totally agree. It’s apex Tom Cruise running.

",i rewatched all of tom cruises films from endless love to mission impossible dead reckoning and ranked the running moments in his filmography earlier this year in anticipation of the release of mission impossible the final reckoning i decided to rank all of tom cruises running scenes in the mi franchise id worked on several mi data pieces for various companies and figured it would be easy to rank the ish running moments when the list was completed it felt incomplete so i decided to rank all of the running scenes in his filmography starting with s endless love and finishing with s mission impossible dead reckoning cruise had gone to extreme lengths for his films so i decided to honor his hard work by putting together this absurd list quick note his x handle always makes me laugh heres what you need to know about the list i found and ranked moments i counted running sprinting and jogging the amount of time doesnt matter either in top gun theres a onesecond shot of him running to hit a volleyball it was included a short blurb was included for list items timestamps have been included for the top some of the timestamps may be a little off for you it depends on wherehow you watch the movies for me it was a mixture of dvds blurays vudu and streaming channels i researched the top scenes and wrote more about them and included youtube links this list is obviously subjective but after

for thinking they can blow cruise up dude has ash all over his face collateral runs out of a hospital and across an overpass when he starts running i dont think hell ever look faster on screen edge of tomorrow arrest this man in an alltimer cruise moment he tries to escape arrest and it ends badly youtube clip moments before brendan gleesons character yells arrest this man tom cruise delivers an alltimer cruise moment in which this dialogue is delivered i just inspired millions of people to join your army and when the body bags come home and theyre looking for someone to blame how hard do you think it would be for me to convince people to blame you id imagine the general would prefer to avoid that cruise enters gleesons office with total confidence and he quickly becomes a slimy rat whose escape attempt ends quickly its perfect and it makes his heroic transformation more interesting director doug liman did a great job weaponizing cruises charm in this scene and its fun watching a guy who cant escape an office building becoming a worldsaving soldier the firm the final chase scene he runs jumps goes up steps and this is when we get to see his true breakaway speed and hes holding a briefcase youtube clip the firm is cruises first film to fully showcase his soontobefamous running form elbows and knees we get a glimpse of it at the minute mark when hes chasing down jeannie tripplehorn but its not until the climactic chase that we see his breakaway speed for several minutes as hes running away from tobin jigsaw bell far and away in a neat transition cruise starts running so fast that the next shot is of an explosion talk about explosive running youtube clip i love how ron howard cuts from a sprinting tom cruise to an explosion its silly and it always puts a smile on my face i also love that the movie ends with the land run of mission impossible rogue nation cruise wipes out while trying to jump over a car it is very funny and the mi score helps make it better youtube clip this is mission impossible i cant just cross a street and get in a car mcquarrie talking about a conversation he had with cruise on the rogue nation commentary when putting together the top i always knew that this threesecond moment would be included its a silly moment punctuated by cheeky musical accompaniment and it proves that cruise doesnt take himself seriously its made even better by the knowledge that cruise came up with this bit on the day and he surprised the crew with his illfated car jump also the ensuing dialogue what are you talking about is delightful at this point in his career cruise was on a hot streak and its fun knowing that he was still totally down to make himself look like a dork mission impossible fallout iconic run across the building punctuated by a beautiful tracking shot dude looks amazing and he almost catches cavill youtube clip i loved doing this but it hurt tom cruise fallout bluray commentary watching cruise run across the blackfriars railway bridge is an alltimer cruise moment for multiple reasons it looks great and is a perfect trailer moment im jumping out of a window great line i love the reaction he gets from the people in the office they tom was still recovering from the ankle break he suffered during a jump gone awry director christopher mcquarrie said he was going for it the score rules its a bit gratuitous but the running makes sense in regards to the story mission impossible cruise runs from an exploding restaurant and does his first i look awesome while running in an action film work lots of fish die youtube clip that one was particularly very crazy talking about the scene on the graham norton show tom cruise was already a big star in but this moment made him a gigantic action movie star he had been in top gun sitting in a plane legend lots of rolling and crouch running days of thunder more sitting far and away boxing and the outsiders fisticuffs but mission impossible saw him entering a new phase of his career this moment was everywhere in and its one of the most iconic images of the mission impossible franchise it gets added points because the stunt looks legitimately dangerous and features some solid arm work from tom risky business a cigarettesmoking cruise wearing sunglasses at night runs up to some teenagers while the song mannish boy plays on the soundtrack this is the moment when cruise became tom cruise youtube clip starts at seconds wearing a suit coat black shirt black sunglasses and puffing on a cigarette cruise is strutting down the street and runs up to a group of classmates the moment lasts only seven seconds but its a turning point for cruise also the song selection is perfect vanilla sky cruise runs through an empty times square youtube clip the groundwork for the times square running in vanilla sky was set up in the film jerry maguire in the cameron crowedirected movie cruise dramatically runs through an airport and it looks great years later while filming vanilla sky crowe and cruise pulled some strings with the city of new york and were able to close down times square for three hours on a sunday morning in november the idea was that cruises character hates being alone and he dreams that hes alone in one of the busiest places in the world its total vanity but i love that cruise has a running scene in an empty times square collateral he throws a chair through a glass window then wipes out on the chair and just keeps running its his most aggressive running ever youtube clip starts at collateral not only features the best sitting performance of tom cruises career it also features his most aggressive running toms character vincent is a straightup killer and its fun watching cruise as he fully commits to being a coyote who chases down his prey with lightningfast footwork theres a moment towards the end when vincent is chasing down max and annie jada pinkett smith running in heels and he takes a chair to smash a window so he can run through it however cruise mistimedmisjudged the chairs trajectory and he wiped out on the chair and fell to the ground the neat thing is that he springs up immediately and keeps running its a perfect showcase for cruises tenacity and toughness and i love that the unplanned moment made its way into the film and so does mann who felt like it added to the realism of collateral its a secondslong moment but i love that nothing can stop cruise from running mission impossible iii cruise runs across some rooftops and then he sprints through a shanghai fishing village youtube clip in cruise had been running in movies for years and had some memorable sprints in war of the worlds the firm minority report collateral and far and away however his sprinting in mi which took takes to get perfect made people sit up and realize they were witnessing cinematic running history its the fastest cruise has ever looked and the spidercam rig that was built for the scene works perfectly as it tracks alongside cruise as he damn near goes plaid on the shanghai sidewalks during the bluray commentary director jj abrams says i loved watching you run to cruise and i totally agree its apex tom

1k8kptn,"What movie did you think people would talk about forever, but fell off?","Now there's those movies that just seem to be timeless that no matter how old they get, they always seem to come up in topics of discussion or get referenced or come up in to top Ten lists. Good examples of this are Back to the future, wizard of oz, and even a movie like office space. But what's a movie that you thought was gonna get talked about for a long time, but now nobody seems to talk about it at all.

Just finished my A24 weekend marathon (wrapped up with Everything Everywhere All At Once, Talk to Me, and Civil War) and I'm struck again by how consistently this studio has managed to dominate cultural conversations around film for the past decade.

What started as an indie darling has become a full-on cultural phenomenon - to the point where ""it's an A24 film"" has become shorthand for a certain aesthetic and quality expectation. They've somehow managed to bridge the gap between critical acclaim and cult following in a way that feels unique in today's fragmented media landscape.

Their formula seems deceptively simple: find distinctive directorial voices, give them creative freedom, market the films with striking visuals and minimal exposition, and let word-of-mouth do the rest. But the consistency is remarkable.

What I find most interesting is how they've become a trusted brand for younger audiences who might otherwise be disengaged from non-franchise cinema. The way their films spread through TikTok and social media feels different from traditional film marketing.

1k6433k,First Image from Netflix's THE OLD GUARD 2 - Starring Charlize Theron,"Andy (Charlize Theron) and her team of immortal warriors are back, with a renewed sense of purpose in their mission to protect the world.

With Booker (Matthias Schoenaerts) still in exile after his betrayal, and Quynh (Veronica Ngô) out for revenge after escaping her underwater prison, Andy grapples with her newfound mortality as a mysterious threat emerges that could jeopardize everything she’s worked towards for thousands of years.

1k4o61c,"April 18-20 Box Office Recap: 'Sinners' opens with a fantastic $48 million domestically, making it the best opening for a live-action original film in years. Meanwhile, 'A Minecraft Movie' crosses $700 million worldwide.","https://preview.redd.it/ve54b1yp29we1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=d66d93333fd7c823d8b731a79eebfac3bfbba7ad

On Easter weekend, audiences decided to go watch ***Sinners***. The result? A #1 debut, and the biggest debut for an original film in the post-COVID era. While ***A Minecraft Movie*** had to cede the top spot, it's already over $700 million worldwide.

The Top 10 earned a combined $127.9 million this weekend. That's up a massive 109.7% from last year, when ***Civil War*** held the top spot from disappointing newcomers like ***Abigail*** and ***The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare***.

Debuting atop, Ryan Coogler's ***Sinners*** earned a fantastic $48 million in 3,308 theaters. This is the best debut for Coogler's career outside the ***Black Panther*** films. In fact, it's the biggest debut for a live-action original film in the post-COVID climate, opening above ***Nope*** ($44.3 million).

Simply put, it's a fantastic start. Take into account, getting an original film to open this high is a miracle, given that audiences are pivoting to focusing on franchises. It's a testament to the strength of Ryan Coogler and Michael B. Jordan. So how they did succeed where other original films failed?

For the past decade, Coogler has earned some great good will, thanks to his works in films like ***Creed*** and ***Black Panther***. The films have earned fantastic reception, allowing him to finally get an original title like ***Sinners*** to get greenlit. It wasn't easy, obviously; a big reason why some studios turned it down was Coogler's request to have the film rights revert to him after 25 years. So Warner Bros. took the bullet and agreed to his terms, [a decision that apparently scared a lot of Hollywood executives.](https://www.vulture.com/article/to-hollywood-the-scariest-part-of-sinners-is-ryan-coogler.html)

The film's clear selling point was Coogler and Jordan, but the premise was also very important: a 1930s horror film, with Jordan playing twins. 2025 has been very weak for horror; the biggest horror film is ***The Monkey***, which hasn't even topped $70 million worldwide. The audience was starving for a horror film and ***Sinners*** arrived at the right time to offer just that. The film's fantastic reviews cannot be ignored either; it's sitting at a marvelous 98% on Rotten Tomatoes and 84/100 on Metacritic. That makes it one of the best films of the year, so even non-horror fans wanted to see if the film would live up to the hype.

According to Warner Bros., the biggest demos were black (49%), Caucasians (27%), Hispanic and Latino (14%), and Asian (6%). They gave it an incredible ""A"" on CinemaScore. This makes it one of the few horror films to get an ""A"" on the site (***Poltergeist*** and ***Aliens*** are the other two) in its 46-year-old history. Yes, it's insanely hard for a horror film to get this grade.

What does this mean? That the film is gonna have some damn great legs. It's already seen in the weekend; horror films can drop over 40% on Sunday, yet ***Sinners*** dropped just 25%. With no horror competition till ***Final Destination: Bloodlines***, ***Sinners*** can have a lot of space. For now, we're predicting a $170 million domestic total for the film, which is simply fantastic all around.

***A Minecraft Movie*** dropped 48% this weekend, grossing $40.4 million. That's not a bad drop, but it's still rough just like last week's. The film is not collapsing, but it's not showing great legs either. The film has amassed $343.8 million so far, and it should still hit over $450 million domestically. 

Unsurprisingly, ***The King of Kings*** benefitted from the Easter weekend. It dipped just 9%, earning $17.5 million this weekend. That's one of the best holds for a film playing at over 3,000 theaters. Through 10 days, the film has earned $45.6 million, although with the holiday over, maybe it will have a steep drop next weekend.

20th Century Studios' ***The Amateur*** was hit by the arrival of ***Sinners***. It dropped a rough 53%, earning $7 million this weekend. While the film was aiming an old audience that doesn't go to opening weekend, it looks like the film is struggling to leg out. Through 10 days, the film has earned a weak $27.1 million, and it remains a question mark if it will hit $40 million domestically.

In fifth place, A24's ***Warfare*** dipped 42%, adding $4.8 million this weekend. Through 10 days, the film has earned $17.1 million, and it will probably end its run with around $25 million domestically.

Universal/Blumhouse's ***Drop*** added $3.2 million this weekend, which is a poor 55% drop after its already low start. Despite positive reviews and word of mouth, the audience doesn't appear to be interested in the film. Through 10 days, it has earned just $13.4 million, and it's now guaranteed to miss $20 million domestically, making it one of Blumhouse's lowest grossing titles.

***COLORFUL STAGE! The Movie: A Miku Who Can’t Sing*** managed to sneak into the seventh spot, despite playing in just 800 theaters, earning $2.8 million this weekend.

Focus Features' re-release of ***Pride & Prejudice*** earned $2.8 million in 1,393 theaters. That takes its lifetime total to $41.3 million.

***The Chosen: Last Supper — Part 3*** collapsed 75% this weekend, earning just $1.5 million this weekend. Through all 3 installments, the show has made $42.9 million so far.

Rounding up the Top 10 was Disney's ***Snow White***, which is nearing the end of its run. It had another brutal 58% drop, earning just $1.2 million this weekend. The film's domestic total stands at a poor $84.6 million so far.

Bleecker Street released ***The Wedding Banquet*** in 1,142 theaters, although the film earned just $922,906. That means that the film is gonna make less than what Ang Lee's original made back in 1993 ($6.9 million).

But the real worst performer of the week was Briarcliff's animated film ***Sneaks***. Despite playing in 1,500 theaters, the film earned an abysmal $530,786 this weekend. That's one of the worst debuts for a film playing in over 1,000 theaters. Expect this to fade quickly.

Ahead of its wide release this week, A24's ***The Legend of Ochi*** debuted in 4 theaters, earning $52,514. That's a $13,129 per-theater average, which is quite low (usually buzzy titles like this make $25K or more). Let's just hope it can do better when it hits wide release.

Janus Films also released David Cronenberg's ***The Shrouds*** in 3 theaters, where the film earned $49,361. Alos a low $16,454 per-theater average. It will continue expanding in the coming weeks.

#**OVERSEAS**

***A Minecraft Movie*** earned $59 million overseas, taking its worldwide total to $720 million. The best markets are the UK ($59.2M), Germany ($27.8M), Australia ($27.4M), Mexico ($24.8M) and China ($24M). The billion mark is becoming more and more likely, pals.

***Sinners*** earned $15.4 million in 71 markets, taking its worldwide numbers to $63.5 million. The best debuts were in the UK ($3.2M), France ($2M), Mexico ($1.1M), Germany ($898K) and Australia ($842K). An okay start, but it's pretty clear it's gonna lean heavily on the domestic side.

***The Amateur*** added a further $11.6 million this weekend, for a $63.8 million worldwide total. The best markets are the UK ($4.1M), France ($3.3M), Mexico ($3.2M), Japan ($2.3M) and Spain ($2M). At the very least, it should hit $100 million worldwide. That'd be great if it didn't cost $60 million.

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*Dog Man* | Jan/31 | Universal | $36,001,940 | $97,970,355 | $140,534,355 | $40M

- DreamWorks' ***Dog Man*** has ended its run with $97 million domestically and $140 million worldwide. Definitely a success, given it cost just $40 million. But something weird about the film are its legs. Normally, animated films leg out to a 3x multiplier. But ***Dog Man*** finished with just a 2.72x multiplier, making it one of the most front-loaded animated films. While the Super Bowl impacted its second weekend, not hitting the $100 million milestone after its debut is kinda disappointing. But then again, this should be enough if DreamWorks wants a new franchise.

#**THIS WEEKEND**

We've got three wide releases, though it's unlikely any of them can take the top spot.

The closest that could challenge the top spot is Amazon MGM's ***The Accountant 2***, which brings back Ben Affleck, Jon Bernthal, Cynthia Addai-Robinson, and J. K. Simmons in their roles. The original film earned $155 million worldwide, and has been a huge success in streaming and home media, so a sequel was pretty much imminent. Although the 9-year gap raises concerns that they might have waited too long.

Another release is Sony's ***Until Dawn***, an adaptation of the video game. Director David F. Sandberg has had success in the horror field, and in fairness, the movie tries to change things up from the game. Nevertheless, the film's premise (a time loop involving different killers) suggests it pretty much abandoned the game's original plot. It remains to be seen if the fans will be willing to buy a ticket.

Meanwhile, 'A Minecraft Movie' crosses $700 million worldwide.","https://preview.redd.it/ve54b1yp29we1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=d66d93333fd7c823d8b731a79eebfac3bfbba7ad

On Easter weekend, audiences decided to go watch ***Sinners***. The result? A #1 debut, and the biggest debut for an original film in the post-COVID era. While ***A Minecraft Movie*** had to cede the top spot, it's already over $700 million worldwide.

The Top 10 earned a combined $127.9 million this weekend. That's up a massive 109.7% from last year, when ***Civil War*** held the top spot from disappointing newcomers like ***Abigail*** and ***The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare***.

Debuting atop, Ryan Coogler's ***Sinners*** earned a fantastic $48 million in 3,308 theaters. This is the best debut for Coogler's career outside the ***Black Panther*** films. In fact, it's the biggest debut for a live-action original film in the post-COVID climate, opening above ***Nope*** ($44.3 million).

Simply put, it's a fantastic start. Take into account, getting an original film to open this high is a miracle, given that audiences are pivoting to focusing on franchises. It's a testament to the strength of Ryan Coogler and Michael B. Jordan. So how they did succeed where other original films failed?

For the past decade, Coogler has earned some great good will, thanks to his works in films like ***Creed*** and ***Black Panther***. The films have earned fantastic reception, allowing him to finally get an original title like ***Sinners*** to get greenlit. It wasn't easy, obviously; a big reason why some studios turned it down was Coogler's request to have the film rights revert to him after 25 years. So Warner Bros. took the bullet and agreed to his terms, [a decision that apparently scared a lot of Hollywood executives.](https://www.vulture.com/article/to-hollywood-the-scariest-part-of-sinners-is-ryan-coogler.html)

The film's clear selling point was Coogler and Jordan, but the premise was also very important: a 1930s horror film, with Jordan playing twins. 2025 has been very weak for horror; the biggest horror film is ***The Monkey***, which hasn't even topped $70 million worldwide. The audience was starving for a horror film and ***Sinners*** arrived at the right time to offer just that. The film's fantastic reviews cannot be ignored either; it's sitting at a marvelous 98% on Rotten Tomatoes and 84/100 on Metacritic. That makes it one of the best films of the year, so even non-horror fans wanted to see if the film would live up to the hype.

According to Warner Bros., the biggest demos were black (49%), Caucasians (27%), Hispanic and Latino (14%), and Asian (6%). They gave it an incredible ""A"" on CinemaScore. This makes it one of the few horror films to get an ""A"" on the site (***Poltergeist*** and ***Aliens*** are the other two) in its 46-year-old history. Yes, it's insanely hard for a horror film to get this grade.

What does this mean? That the film is gonna have some damn great legs. It's already seen in the weekend; horror films can drop over 40% on Sunday, yet ***Sinners*** dropped just 25%. With no horror competition till ***Final Destination: Bloodlines***, ***Sinners*** can have a lot of space. For now, we're predicting a $170 million domestic total for the film, which is simply fantastic all around.

***A Minecraft Movie*** dropped 48% this weekend, grossing $40.4 million. That's not a bad drop, but it's still rough just like last week's. The film is not collapsing, but it's not showing great legs either. The film has amassed $343.8 million so far, and it should still hit over $450 million domestically. 

Unsurprisingly, ***The King of Kings*** benefitted from the Easter weekend. It dipped just 9%, earning $17.5 million this weekend. That's one of the best holds for a film playing at over 3,000 theaters. Through 10 days, the film has earned $45.6 million, although with the holiday over, maybe it will have a steep drop next weekend.

20th Century Studios' ***The Amateur*** was hit by the arrival of ***Sinners***. It dropped a rough 53%, earning $7 million this weekend. While the film was aiming an old audience that doesn't go to opening weekend, it looks like the film is struggling to leg out. Through 10 days, the film has earned a weak $27.1 million, and it remains a question mark if it will hit $40 million domestically.

In fifth place, A24's ***Warfare*** dipped 42%, adding $4.8 million this weekend. Through 10 days, the film has earned $17.1 million, and it will probably end its run with around $25 million domestically.

Universal/Blumhouse's ***Drop*** added $3.2 million this weekend, which is a poor 55% drop after its already low start. Despite positive reviews and word of mouth, the audience doesn't appear to be interested in the film. Through 10 days, it has earned just $13.4 million, and it's now guaranteed to miss $20 million domestically, making it one of Blumhouse's lowest grossing titles.

***COLORFUL STAGE! The Movie: A Miku Who Can’t Sing*** managed to sneak into the seventh spot, despite playing in just 800 theaters, earning $2.8 million this weekend.

Focus Features' re-release of ***Pride & Prejudice*** earned $2.8 million in 1,393 theaters. That takes its lifetime total to $41.3 million.

***The Chosen: Last Supper — Part 3*** collapsed 75% this weekend, earning just $1.5 million this weekend. Through all 3 installments, the show has made $42.9 million so far.

Rounding up the Top 10 was Disney's ***Snow White***, which is nearing the end of its run. It had another brutal 58% drop, earning just $1.2 million this weekend. The film's domestic total stands at a poor $84.6 million so far.

Bleecker Street released ***The Wedding Banquet*** in 1,142 theaters, although the film earned just $922,906. That means that the film is gonna make less than what Ang Lee's original made back in 1993 ($6.9 million).

But the real worst performer of the week was Briarcliff's animated film ***Sneaks***. Despite playing in 1,500 theaters, the film earned an abysmal $530,786 this weekend. That's one of the worst debuts for a film playing in over 1,000 theaters. Expect this to fade quickly.

Ahead of its wide release this week, A24's ***The Legend of Ochi*** debuted in 4 theaters, earning $52,514. That's a $13,129 per-theater average, which is quite low (usually buzzy titles like this make $25K or more). Let's just hope it can do better when it hits wide release.

Janus Films also released David Cronenberg's ***The Shrouds*** in 3 theaters, where the film earned $49,361. Alos a low $16,454 per-theater average. It will continue expanding in the coming weeks.

#**OVERSEAS**

***A Minecraft Movie*** earned $59 million overseas, taking its worldwide total to $720 million. The best markets are the UK ($59.2M), Germany ($27.8M), Australia ($27.4M), Mexico ($24.8M) and China ($24M). The billion mark is becoming more and more likely, pals.

***Sinners*** earned $15.4 million in 71 markets, taking its worldwide numbers to $63.5 million. The best debuts were in the UK ($3.2M), France ($2M), Mexico ($1.1M), Germany ($898K) and Australia ($842K). An okay start, but it's pretty clear it's gonna lean heavily on the domestic side.

***The Amateur*** added a further $11.6 million this weekend, for a $63.8 million worldwide total. The best markets are the UK ($4.1M), France ($3.3M), Mexico ($3.2M), Japan ($2.3M) and Spain ($2M). At the very least, it should hit $100 million worldwide. That'd be great if it didn't cost $60 million.

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*Dog Man* | Jan/31 | Universal | $36,001,940 | $97,970,355 | $140,534,355 | $40M

- DreamWorks' ***Dog Man*** has ended its run with $97 million domestically and $140 million worldwide. Definitely a success, given it cost just $40 million. But something weird about the film are its legs. Normally, animated films leg out to a 3x multiplier. But ***Dog Man*** finished with just a 2.72x multiplier, making it one of the most front-loaded animated films. While the Super Bowl impacted its second weekend, not hitting the $100 million milestone after its debut is kinda disappointing. But then again, this should be enough if DreamWorks wants a new franchise.

#**THIS WEEKEND**

We've got three wide releases, though it's unlikely any of them can take the top spot.

The closest that could challenge the top spot is Amazon MGM's ***The Accountant 2***, which brings back Ben Affleck, Jon Bernthal, Cynthia Addai-Robinson, and J. K. Simmons in their roles. The original film earned $155 million worldwide, and has been a huge success in streaming and home media, so a sequel was pretty much imminent. Although the 9-year gap raises concerns that they might have waited too long.

Another release is Sony's ***Until Dawn***, an adaptation of the video game. Director David F. Sandberg has had success in the horror field, and in fairness, the movie tries to change things up from the game. Nevertheless, the film's premise (a time loop involving different killers) suggests it pretty much abandoned the game's original plot. It remains to be seen if the fans will be willing to buy a ticket.

And as mentioned, A24's ***The Legend of Ochi*** is hitting wide release. The limited release numbers were quite underwhelming, but perhaps it could surprise when it hits wide release.

1k6yvw7,'Havoc' - Review Thread,"Director: Gareth Evans

Cast: Tom Hardy,  Jessie Mei Li, Timothy Olyphant, Forest Whitaker, Justin Cornwell

Logline: *After a drug deal gone wrong, a bruised detective must fight his way through the criminal underworld to rescue a politician's estranged son, unravelling a deep web of corruption and conspiracy that ensnares his entire city.*

**Rotten Tomatoes:** [67/100](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/havoc_2025)

**Metacritic:** [59/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/havoc/)

Some Reviews:

[The Hollywood Reporter - David Rooney](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/havoc-review-tom-hardy-gareth-evans-netflix-1236198216/)

>With Hardy in fine form at the wheel, *Havoc* knows what its audience wants. It also looks great, with regular Evans DP Matt Flannery’s dynamic cameras zipping in and out of the bloody fray and textured visuals slashed with throbbing colors. The setting is a city so grim and seedy it seems to exist only at night. The fact that the environments were mostly constructed at a studio in Cardiff suggests there’s lots of ace craftspeople hiding out in Wales.

[SlashFilm - Chris Evangelista](https://www.slashfilm.com/1842207/havoc-movie-review-tom-hardy-gareth-evans/)

>To be clear: I love a good, violent action movie as much as the next dude, but you have to give me something more than just one extreme shootout followed by another. Perhaps if the hyperviolence was a little more stylized it would play better. Instead, it's just ugly stuff repeated in numbing fashion. By the time ""Havoc"" ended, I felt as exhausted as Hardy's beaten and bruised character. I suppose Evans and company deserve some credit for making an action movie that really leans into the brutality, but there's only so much of that you can put up with before it starts to grow tedious.

[Variety - Peter Debruge](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/havoc-review-tom-hardy-gareth-evans-1236375320/)

>There’s a reason big-studio producers looked to Sundance darlings like Colin Trevorrow, Rian Johnson and Jon Watts to handle their tentpoles: not because those guys are great at action, but because they keep the interpersonal dynamics interesting. That’s precisely where Evans wreaks the most havoc, ignoring (or simply not understanding) what connects us to such characters in the first place — and therefore ensuring that his unwieldy Netflix vehicle is dead on arrival.

[NextBestPicture - Giovanni Lago](https://nextbestpicture.com/havoc/) \- 6/10

>After years of waiting, it feels like “Havoc” was never going to reach the pre-conceived levels of hype that it was supposed to live up to. It’s clear that whenever certain moments were filmed years later than the original period of principal photography (mainly due to Hardy’s more than apparent changes in beard thickness), there’s doubt it made any real difference in the final cut that Evans envisioned. Still, when “Havoc” hits, it only reminds us how awesome it feels when Evans gets to do his own thing. Even a flawed Gareth Evans film satisfies more than most action flicks today.

[Empire - Beth Webb](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/havoc/) \- 4/5

>There’s also something refreshingly egoless to it; Hardy may have top billing but takes not only many sucker punches to the face but an entire roof to the head. Around him Evans utilities his full cast, throwing greener actors like Quelin Sepulveda, who plays Charlie’s partner Mia, into the eye of the storm, armed with a meat cleaver and a mission to survive. The result is a throbbing, bone-crunching diorama of violence with the occasional horrifying, glorious flourish (you’ll never want to see a fishing harpoon again).

[Slant Magazine - Jake Cole](https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/havoc-review-tom-hardy-gareth-evans/)

>Instead of elaborate exchanges of close-quarters strikes and counters, the characters here tend to get the upper hand based on who has the quickest reflexes in tackling an assailant or getting a block up at the last possible second. Despite the advanced choreography that Evans and Flannery capture with a generally superior sense of visual fluidity than they displayed in the *Raid* movies, there’s an overwhelming sense of chaos here that feels realistic.

[Nick Schager - The Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/tom-hardys-havoc-review-the-action-extravaganza-of-the-year/)

>*Havoc* is such relentless, hardhearted business that the squeamish need not enlist. Nonetheless, those with a hankering for escalating insanity will be well satiated by this saga, whose narrative convolutions are untangled in a second half that puts a premium on combat. Disappointingly, Evans (who wrote the script) shortchanges Olyphant in a role that’s barely one-dimensional and receives no stand-out moments—to a large extent because he shares only scant screen time with Hardy. The director makes up for it, however, with a barrage of broken bones and mutilated corpses—and set pieces drenched in slow motion and decorated with flying glass, splinter, and bodily debris—that tips the material into sensory-overload territory.

[Collider - Tania Hussain](https://collider.com/havoc-movie-review-netflix-tom-hardy/)

>*Havoc* might deliver on its promise of blood, guts, and glory, but it’s these committed performances that keep it from completely collapsing under its self-induced chaos. While the vision by Evans swings hard as a stylishly savage brawler, it rarely lands with meaning, which also feels like an injustice to the filmmaker’s incredible past work. Despite a top-tier cast and bone-rattling action to keep you engaged, the Netflix flick buckles under a cluttered story with chaotic execution. It’s watchable, even entertaining in bursts — but beneath all the bruises and broken bones, there’s not much else to hold onto.

>Rote as Evans’ plot might be, and wasteful as its treatment of certain characters *definitely* is (pour one out for Jessie Mei Li, whose screen time as Walker’s new partner greatly outweighs her purpose to the story), he has a well-developed ear for ice-cold gangster speak, and he isn’t afraid to make people pay a steep price for their penance.

1k95szv,Perfect Days hit me harder than I expected...pure life lessons hidden in silence.,"So today I watched *Perfect Days* (Japanese movie) and honestly...I didn't expect it to leave such a strong impact.

At first, it feels so simple... just a guy living his everyday life, cleaning toilets, listening to old cassettes, taking pictures of trees. But the more you watch, the more you realize how much peace and depth there is behind his routine.

One thing that stood out to me was how he smiles at the sky every morning. Like he’s genuinely grateful for another day. No rush, no complaints, just...existing with full heart.

He doesn’t talk much unless necessary, but when he does interact (like with his niece or that random guy he plays shadow games with), you can feel how much he enjoys human connection too. He’s not *avoiding* people...he just doesn't *need* noise to be happy.

There’s this beautiful bittersweetness. He’s not ""choosing loneliness"" in a sad way...it's more like, life took him down this path, and instead of fighting it, he embraced it with full acceptance. That’s powerful in today’s world where everyone feels pressure to chase something constantly.

The scene where his niece leaves... and he quietly cries...man, that hit different.  
Not because he's weak or regretting, but because even the strongest hearts carry a little sadness somewhere deep.

And that final drive...the way he smiles and then tears up while listening to music, that was pure *life itself*. Happiness, sadness, memories, gratitude...all flowing through him at once.

Honestly gave me the same vibe I felt after watching Shawshank Redemption...the idea that freedom and peace are an inside job. No matter what life gives or takes away.

One of the most beautiful movies I’ve ever watched without trying to be ""loud"" about it. I liked the whole silent treatment vibe

Also, I’m surprised how not many people talk about this movie.

Revenge of the Sith was the first Star Wars movie I ever saw in theaters, and I still carry some memories with me from that experience. I still remember reacting to the opening aerial battle over Coruscant, and I was so loud that my then-best friend who was sitting beside me had to lean over to me and tell me, “Dude, be quiet.”  I also remember after the car ride home, my grandmother, who has since passed away, called my cousin, my friend and I all “little Skywalker’s.”

He's the one I showed scenes to from all the Star Wars movies as a kid over and over and over, and he was the main one I had lightsaber fights with as a kid. He gave me new memories that I can carry with me from this theater experience. He always mimics Windu's face when he is lightsaber locked with Palpatine about mid-fight, he mouthed, “Darth….Vader” as Palpatine names him, and I noticed he side-eyed me when Anakin ignites his lightsaber in front of the Younglings.

1k7x2zr,Didn’t think 2001: A space odyssey was such a horror,"I thought I watched the movie long ago but couldn’t remember so I watched it again. What a mind mover it is. Creepy as hell at times. By the end I thought this movie was a psychological horror. Even in the beginning, with the monkeys and their faces, oddly eerie. Then with the robot and that slow realization that 9000 series computer is a fucking killer to his slow mercy pleading death. No jumpscares or anything, just empty shots and crazy good cinema. Didn’t think it was possible to convey such fear, eeriness, nothingness in such shots. Incredible and creepy. Then it just started getting even worse. Hallucination like extraterrestrial shots with colors and sound that make you feel like you’ve gone insane. The occasional look of horror from the crew member as he is experiencing this is also DEEPLY unsettling. Then finally, the room. Was expecting a jumpscare but nothing. Just weird play with time and age. Extremely unsettling. 

Was expecting something like Interstellar. Mind bending storyline that makes you go “wow the universe is a crazy place.” Odessey makes you go “Wow the universe is scary, empty, nothing. torture. Evil. Cinical. Relative. Unending. Lonely.”

You know those movie scenes that just get stuck in your brain and you can't shake them? Not necessarily the best scene ever, or from your favorite movie, but just a single, specific moment that pops up in your head out of nowhere, even years after you've seen it.

What's that one scene for you? What movie is it from, and what's so unforgettable about it? Was it something shocking, something beautiful, something weird, or just a really powerful moment?

For me, it's definitely a few moments from Annihilation. But one that really messed with me was when they get deeper into the Shimmer and you start seeing how the mutations are blending everything together. Like those flowers that had human-like features, or even the way the crew members started to get mixed up with the environment and each other. That whole visual of nature and people merging in this bizarre, unnatural way was so creepy and unsettling. It really made you think about what was happening in that zone. That whole idea of things losing their boundaries and becoming something else… yeah, that sticks with you. Coming from a person with plant biology background may be a reason.

1k6tg5g,'Until Dawn' - Review Thread,"*One year after her sister disappeared, Clover and her friends head to the remote valley where she vanished to search for answers. Exploring an abandoned visitor center, they soon encounter a masked killer who murders them one by one. However, when they mysteriously wake up at the beginning of the same night, they're forced to relive the terror over and over again.*

**Rotten Tomatoes:** [61%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/until_dawn_2025)

**Metacritic:** [53/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/until-dawn/)

Some Reviews:

[AV Club - Jacob Oller](https://www.avclub.com/until-dawn-review) \- D+

>Horror, whether in games or in movies, is about setups and payoffs. *Until Dawn* is a film almost exclusively of setups, with the payoffs either mismatched or permanently deferred. In its indecision around what kind of film it wanted to turn a decision-driven game into, firing its shotgun approach haphazardly into the air, it incoherently spins itself in circles.

[Inverse - Lyvie Scott](https://www.inverse.com/entertainment/until-dawn-review-horror-video-games)

>Throws plot out the window in favor of gore and schlock. \[Using\] a time-loop conceit to replicate the feeling of respawning in a video game, it gives director David F. Sandberg an excuse to blitz through as many teen horror tropes as can fit in two hours.

[Screen Rant](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/1647) \- [Mary Kassel](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/mary-kassel) \- 8/10

>Until Dawn takes the trope of the time loop & raises the stakes, immersing us in a thrilling & dynamic world of characters we can't stop rooting for. The movie is at its best when it's not taking itself too seriously. ***Until Dawn***\*\*'s weakest moments are when the action slows down and the writing attempts to psychoanalyze Clover\*\* and her issues. While it's necessary for her to have a fraught emotional backstory and for there to be hints of development, these transitions are far from seamless. Like all scary movies, *Until Dawn* sprinkles in commentary about the nature of grief and fear. However, it doesn't waste too much time trying to have a message, as it knows that isn't what the story is for.

[Slashfilm](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/1996) \- [Bill Bria](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/bill-bria) \- 8/10

>Although the film is deliberately not a repetition of the video game's plot, it absolutely adapts the game's implicit concept of asking the player whether they could actually survive a horror movie or not. ""Until Dawn"" the movie subtextually asks those questions of its viewers throughout, and with so many various beasties to encounter, the answers will vary for each person alone, never mind for multiple people. The movie's variety is the peanut butter to that idea's chocolate, never allowing the film to feel stuck in one mode even as it establishes its own structure. To borrow a phrase from Bobby, ""Until Dawn"" really does feel like the platonic ideal of a graveyard smash.

[FandomWire](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/100009878) \- [Manuel São Bento](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/manuel-sao-bento) \- B+

>Ella Rubin stands out in a cast that meets the bare minimum, and David F. Sandberg proves yet again that he's a filmmaker with vision, talent, and the creativity to craft visually captivating horror sequences.

[IGN Movies](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/811) \- [Chase Hutchinson](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/chase-hutchinson) \- 5/10

>Until Dawn shares a title and some key details with the game that inspired it, though it mostly tries to do its own thing – to mixed results. While Annabelle: Creation director David F. Sandberg is able to find moments of bloody fun and tension – particularly in the way he shoots darkness – the lackluster script he’s working with isn’t doing him or the movie any favors. It isn’t a total disaster, but as it pushed its one-dimensional characters through a cycle of horror cinema’s greatest hits, I wished that the morning could come as quickly as possible.

Some Reviews:

[AV Club - Jacob Oller](https://www.avclub.com/until-dawn-review) \- D+

>Horror, whether in games or in movies, is about setups and payoffs. *Until Dawn* is a film almost exclusively of setups, with the payoffs either mismatched or permanently deferred. In its indecision around what kind of film it wanted to turn a decision-driven game into, firing its shotgun approach haphazardly into the air, it incoherently spins itself in circles.

[Inverse - Lyvie Scott](https://www.inverse.com/entertainment/until-dawn-review-horror-video-games)

>Throws plot out the window in favor of gore and schlock. \[Using\] a time-loop conceit to replicate the feeling of respawning in a video game, it gives director David F. Sandberg an excuse to blitz through as many teen horror tropes as can fit in two hours.

[Screen Rant](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/1647) \- [Mary Kassel](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/mary-kassel) \- 8/10

>Until Dawn takes the trope of the time loop & raises the stakes, immersing us in a thrilling & dynamic world of characters we can't stop rooting for. The movie is at its best when it's not taking itself too seriously. ***Until Dawn***\*\*'s weakest moments are when the action slows down and the writing attempts to psychoanalyze Clover\*\* and her issues. While it's necessary for her to have a fraught emotional backstory and for there to be hints of development, these transitions are far from seamless. Like all scary movies, *Until Dawn* sprinkles in commentary about the nature of grief and fear. However, it doesn't waste too much time trying to have a message, as it knows that isn't what the story is for.

[Slashfilm](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/1996) \- [Bill Bria](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/bill-bria) \- 8/10

>Although the film is deliberately not a repetition of the video game's plot, it absolutely adapts the game's implicit concept of asking the player whether they could actually survive a horror movie or not. ""Until Dawn"" the movie subtextually asks those questions of its viewers throughout, and with so many various beasties to encounter, the answers will vary for each person alone, never mind for multiple people. The movie's variety is the peanut butter to that idea's chocolate, never allowing the film to feel stuck in one mode even as it establishes its own structure. To borrow a phrase from Bobby, ""Until Dawn"" really does feel like the platonic ideal of a graveyard smash.

[FandomWire](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/100009878) \- [Manuel São Bento](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/manuel-sao-bento) \- B+

>Ella Rubin stands out in a cast that meets the bare minimum, and David F. Sandberg proves yet again that he's a filmmaker with vision, talent, and the creativity to craft visually captivating horror sequences.

[IGN Movies](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/811) \- [Chase Hutchinson](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/chase-hutchinson) \- 5/10

>Until Dawn shares a title and some key details with the game that inspired it, though it mostly tries to do its own thing – to mixed results. While Annabelle: Creation director David F. Sandberg is able to find moments of bloody fun and tension – particularly in the way he shoots darkness – the lackluster script he’s working with isn’t doing him or the movie any favors. It isn’t a total disaster, but as it pushed its one-dimensional characters through a cycle of horror cinema’s greatest hits, I wished that the morning could come as quickly as possible.

A stranded young woman joins a group of hunters at a remote cabin, threatening the group's balance. Ask us anything!","More information:

Nina, a young, tempestuous woman, finds herself stranded in the far North. She convinces five men on a bachelor hunting trip, to put her up for a few days. In this masculine microsociety, by turns hilarious and philosophical, Nina starts to feel a sense of belonging she never has before. But a mysterious stranger’s arrival changes the course of this improvised holiday forever. Both raw and dreamlike, Hunting Daze offers up a unique universe where humour, horror, the uncanny, and the sensual combine.

Our film played at SXSW, Fantasia, Sydney FF, KVFF, and more in 2024. It's out now in the US and Canada on Digital.

1k7zxfw,"I just finished the first Rambo movie for the umpteenth time, casually found while channel surfing... and I genuinely feel the desire to share my opinion as a non-expert","I don't have the knowledge for a real review but, to me, **this film is a truly jewel**

Ironically, in my country, Rambo may be used as meme. It's a joking for those person who throw themself headlong into a problem, thinking he can solve all by themself

What Rambo represents, however, is the exact opposite: he is a symbol of **humanity fragility**

Probably Rambo is not a committed movie... but how many other action movies deal with such important themes?

The amazing thing is how these themes are not exploited for political propaganda by those who, perhaps, are sharply aligned; they are told for what they are in themselves and the impact they have on people, how we are all victims

Because, let's be honest, whatever your opinion of Vietnam War, the pain, the loneliness... the contradictions suffered by veterans were tremendous. And it's something that can flood into broader contexts, precious to show the damage of war... **not just during, even after**

Then we have even more: how health is not only physical, but also mental. Denunciation of police abuses. The weak picking on the even weaker. Hatred of the unknown in favor of maintaining an illusory status quo

One of the very few action films that does not overdo with... exaggerations. A film that, within limits, tries to keep itself realistic, plausible. The action is there, but it's secondary to the telling of the story, of the protagonist and his message we talked about above

You're not watching explosions, jumps, missiles, fast vehicles... you're watching the vicissitudes of a **man**; you're feeling his emotions. You can empathise

Last but not least, I try to delve a little bit into the more technical part. The **shots, the cinematography**... I love them. They manage to make you feel the vibes of those places; the cloudy, muggy Northwest, the thick coniferous forests, mountains, the smell of rain and wet earth

For me, a hiking lover, it's simply something magical. It feels like being there, walking through the trees, vibing and living a new adventure

Ironically, in my country, Rambo may be used as meme. It's a joking for those person who throw themself headlong into a problem, thinking he can solve all by themself

What Rambo represents, however, is the exact opposite: he is a symbol of **humanity fragility**

Probably Rambo is not a committed movie... but how many other action movies deal with such important themes?

The amazing thing is how these themes are not exploited for political propaganda by those who, perhaps, are sharply aligned; they are told for what they are in themselves and the impact they have on people, how we are all victims

Because, let's be honest, whatever your opinion of Vietnam War, the pain, the loneliness... the contradictions suffered by veterans were tremendous. And it's something that can flood into broader contexts, precious to show the damage of war... **not just during, even after**

Then we have even more: how health is not only physical, but also mental. Denunciation of police abuses. The weak picking on the even weaker. Hatred of the unknown in favor of maintaining an illusory status quo

One of the very few action films that does not overdo with... exaggerations. A film that, within limits, tries to keep itself realistic, plausible. The action is there, but it's secondary to the telling of the story, of the protagonist and his message we talked about above

You're not watching explosions, jumps, missiles, fast vehicles... you're watching the vicissitudes of a **man**; you're feeling his emotions. You can empathise

Last but not least, I try to delve a little bit into the more technical part. The **shots, the cinematography**... I love them. They manage to make you feel the vibes of those places; the cloudy, muggy Northwest, the thick coniferous forests, mountains, the smell of rain and wet earth

For me, a hiking lover, it's simply something magical. It feels like being there, walking through the trees, vibing and living a new adventure

And finally, this time for real, how an ending is important to hold this boring wall of text together... there is one thing that holds all these points of the film together: the **music**. There is little to say, except that takes me back in time. Sweet nostalgia. Thanks, Rambo

**Summary**  
*Havoc* follows Detective Walker, a bruised and morally ambiguous cop forced to navigate a city’s violent criminal underworld after a drug deal goes wrong. When he's tasked with rescuing a politician’s estranged son, Walker uncovers a far-reaching web of corruption involving crime syndicates and dirty cops. As he fights to survive, he must also confront his own demons in a relentless, high-stakes battle for justice. The film blends brutal, kinetic action with noir-style atmosphere and a stripped-down narrative.

1k8tlyh,Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is absolutely worth your time,"I know there are already a lot of posts and hype around this game already that a post like this seems pointless.

Reason I’m making this post is often when a new game gets hyped, a lot of it is so vague. It’s just kind of like “gameplay fun, writing good” etc and I just never know if to grab the game. I saw this a lot for this game and I watched some gameplay but just wasn’t sold. In the end I decided to buy it as 90% of the time I play the patient gamer and wait for sale so decided to go for it for once.

So I wanted to talk about specific things in the game that have just had me hooked and super glad I bought it and didn’t wait for sale.

The story within the first hour had me hooked. It’s just so unique and gripping. Normally stories take a while to engross me but I very quickly found myself looking forward to the next cutscene or story progression. I realised even if I disliked the gameplay I would be happy to stick on story mode and just play for the story. It really makes you constantly want to know what happens next.

The combat especially when it gets tricky is addictive. I wasn’t sure how I felt with reaction based combat in a turn based game but it’s done so well. Working out when to parry or when the dodge is a better option feels great, a lot of it is very rhythmic. Fighting a boss and losing but coming up with a better game plan and then beating the boss and taking 0 damage feels amazing. Like a boss might do a triple attack where each attack is like 1,2,hit 1,2,hit 1,2,hit and as simple as it is it feels great to dodge. Parrying is more optimal as you counter attack but dodging has a much more forgiving window so when your learning a fight some of it also comes down to working out what’s actually personally doable for you.

Outside of that stuff the turn based combat is great. Lots of fun moves and lots of tactical thinking needed and it’s fun making the most of status effects and using each party members strengths.

The party customisation is amazing. Lots of synergies to create with your team and the talent trees are really well done and it’s fun trying to just get good synergy going on your team. 

Overall this game is just an absolute treat.

Edit: At one point I decided to play for like 5 mins before sleeping. I got stuck on a mini boss and it felt amazing to finally beat. Then my wife said weren’t you going to sleep ages ago? and I was so confused until I realised it had been an hour and not 5 mins.

Well, today the gaming industry finally managed to break me. After many years from its release, last week I finally decided to buy Red Dead Redemption 2. Love open world games, love Rockstar (solely for single player stuff) and love a good far west themed game.

Every cutscene had me hoping not to hear him cough, yet he did.

And then came the end. Arthur saying goodbye to Abigail and Sadie and riding towards the camp. The music, the scene, him recalling that bit of good he did.

I couldn't handle it. I activated the cinematic camera and had to wipe tears off my eyes.

Arrived at the camp, ready for the final showdown. I blast my way out and ride away with John only to get shot off my horse. And it kicked again.

We went up the hill, shooting some Pinkerton and Arthur stops, coughing blood. ""I've pushed all I can""... He gave John his hat and his bag, saying goodbye one last time.

The fight with the Pinkertons, the brawl with Micah and the final face-to-face with Dutch. Then, Arthur crawled to the side of the mountain, watching his last sunset as he fades away.

1k5tbh8,Oblivion Remaster WARNING! Steam Cloud might not have your savedata backed up!,"Hello good folks.

I have been enjoying the first couple of hours of the Remaster

BUT

I couldn’t see my Oblivion saves from my PC when I booted up the game on my SteamDeck. Which was weird, cuz Steam says it’s synced with the cloud.

I did some digging.

It seems Oblivion Remaster uses C/Users/Your\_User\_Here/Documents/My Games for its savedata, regardless of what location you have set for the system folder “Documents”

For most people the system folder “Documents” is probably the aforementioned folder in C/Users. However the default “documents” path can be changed (in properties of the “Documents Folder in This PC). My “Documents” is in D/Documents, and all my games uses that folder correctly, as they look for the “Documents” system folder.

But not Oblivion Remaster. The game has created the C/Users/ documents folder again (that I previously deleted), and the only thing in that folder is the SaveData.

Steam however seems to look for the system folder “Documents” in which there aren’t any savedata from Oblivion Remaster and my saves (and yours maybe) may therefore not be backed up.

Hopefully Bethesda can patch this, so the game uses the user defined “Documents” path instead of the default path it has when Windows is installed. Alternatively, tell Steam to cloud sync the correct folder, where the actually saves are.

I’m not at all the target demographic for this song, and I only heard it because it jumped to the top of the Spotify charts a couple weeks ago. 

This is a perfect pop song. Her vocals are immaculate. The musical production is baller. 

And it’s a song with not just a chorus, but a legit pre-chorus. All three parts of the song are distinctive and sound great. There’s a melancholy to the story. Chappell tells the story in an amazingly open and grounded way, embracing the complicated-ness of the themes. 

I think it’s the best pop song of the last decade. I think it’s a legit great, impressive, catchy-as-all-hell song.

I’m not at all the target demographic for this song, and I only heard it because it jumped to the top of the Spotify charts a couple weeks ago. 

This is a perfect pop song. Her vocals are immaculate. The musical production is baller. 

And it’s a song with not just a chorus, but a legit pre-chorus. All three parts of the song are distinctive and sound great. There’s a melancholy to the story. Chappell tells the story in an amazingly open and grounded way, embracing the complicated-ness of the themes. 

I think it’s the best pop song of the last decade. I think it’s a legit great, impressive, catchy-as-all-hell song.

1k9azuq,Place-name dropping is like a magic trick in song writing,"I've thought about how impactful songs that mention the name of a place can be. Adding a place-name to a song's lyrics is like adding a whole story in one word.

By mentioning New Orleans they trigger an explosion of association in anyone who knows anything about New Orleans. I think of bayous, Louisiana creole and voodoo. To me, the location gives the song a mysterious and magical connotation. 

""Cotton fields"" by Creedence Clearwater Revival is similar. ""It was down in Louisiana just about a mile from Texarkana"" that puts you in the Deep South immediately and all the cultural associations that come with that. He even specifies almost the exact location within the state, which most people won't know about, but he's telling us like it's something we should know, making us curious about the place. 

In Dèrniere Danse, Indila sings ""Dans tout Paris, je m'abandonne"", ""In all of Paris, I abandon myself"". I don't speak French but I can understand some and when she anchors the song in Paris, and most people have some kind of connection to Paris. It expands the scope of the song. 

It's also obviously extremely prevalent in hip hop and rap. Mentioning the city you're from establishes a basis for everything else that is said.

",placename dropping is like a magic trick in song writing ive thought about how impactful songs that mention the name of a place can be adding a placename to a songs lyrics is like adding a whole story in one word i was thinking about house of the rising sun by the animals what if they had sung there is a house just down the street instead of there is a house in new orleans by mentioning new orleans they trigger an explosion of association in anyone who knows anything about new orleans i think of bayous louisiana creole and voodoo to me the location gives the song a mysterious and magical connotation cotton fields by creedence clearwater revival is similar it was down in louisiana just about a mile from texarkana that puts you in the deep south immediately and all the cultural associations that come with that he even specifies almost the exact location within the state which most people wont know about but hes telling us like its something we should know making us curious about the place in dèrniere danse indila sings dans tout paris je mabandonne in all of paris i abandon myself i dont speak french but i can understand some and when she anchors the song in paris and most people have some kind of connection to paris it expands the scope of the song its also obviously extremely prevalent in hip hop and rap mentioning the city youre from establishes a basis for everything else that is said those are some examples i could come up with are there any songs where they mention a place which makes the song more impactful and deeper in your eyes,"song, paris, like, place, house",2025-04-27 18:34:57

1k6bvew,"How a 1960s cult led by a former call girl gave us punk, goth aesthetics, and a Utah dog sanctuary","Mary Ann MacLean has a wild biography. Here's just a start:

1. Sugar Ray Robinson’s live-in mistress
2. Became a call girl—got busted
3. Joined Scientology
3. Got kicked out (with Robert de Grimston, who she’d later marry)
4. Co-founded a new cult: The Process Church of the Final Judgment — basically her remix of Scientology with apocalypse, dogs, and Jesus-Satan dualism

And then? She accidentally planted the seeds of punk.

Many of her followers started bands. One was The Voice, who dropped “Train to Disaster”—arguably the most punk-sounding song of the ‘60s.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7udR0EyUtFY

Guess who played in The Voice? Mick Ronson—yes, that Mick Ronson, the guy who later shredded guitar for Bowie on Hunky Dory, Ziggy Stardust, and Aladdin Sane.

But wait—this ride isn’t over.

She relocates her cult to Barbados. Then the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. Finally, they base their HQ in the USA—where police start investigating a possible link with the Manson cult.

In 1974, she ousted her husband and took control. Moved the group to Arizona. Rebranded it: The Foundation.

Then came the wildest pivot:
""We’re not about apocalypse anymore. We’re about animals.""

They moved to Utah and eventually became the Best Friends Animal Society—today, a squeaky-clean and respected animal welfare nonprofit.

But Mary Ann MacLean's influence doesn't end there.

Industrial, goth, and metal bands have been heavily influenced by The Process' aesthetic—to the point that their magazines have become collector's items. Genesis P-Orridge, for example, was a vocal admirer of The Process. Boyd Rice of Death in June openly collects Process memorabilia and references them in his art.

And what's the end effect of The Process? Well, Mary Ann MacLean pivoted the cult from an apocalyptic doom cult to one about kindness to animals.

1k4v86l,Do a lot of people stop listening to new music after high school?,"My inquiring mind wants to know, is this like a thing that a serious number of people do? If so, what are your thoughts on why this happens? 

I didn’t even know who I really was at 18, and had yet to experience most of the “real world” heartbreak and struggles that would shape a lot of the music I was drawn to and embraced throughout my life. 

Don’t get me wrong, I will stand by NIN’s Downward Spiral/Oasis’s What’s the Story Morning Glory/Radiohead’s Ok Computer til I die. But if that had been the peak of my new music discovery and appreciation, I would have lived a much less fulfilling life creatively, for sure. And I would have been exposed to so many less women and non-white and queer artists. This literally pains me to think about as a musician. 

I would have never had learned about Beach House or Janelle Monae or St Vincent or The Knife 🤯

How can music move forward and progress and evolve faster than a crawl if people stop consuming new artists’ music at 18? Where would we be right now if a large percentage of today’s adults’ new music-listening peaked at Blink-182?

My interest in covers was started by listening to Hendrix in the 90s and then Smashing Pumpkins in the noughties.

Fans of older music were probably aware that up until a few years ago there were a few Youtubers (and some others with dedicated websites, like the Swazoo Kulak Jukebox - IYKYK) who made it their business to upload every old 78 etc. they could get their hands on. Some uploaders had done lot of careful restoration work too.

Some of these collections were ludicrously enormous and were essentially archival, with detailed artist information, recording/pressing information, band members (often uncredited on those old recordings), and so on. It was a great way to introduce new people to prewar Ragtime, Jazz, Blues, Swing, etc. by pointing them to, e.g. RagtimeDorianHenry on Youtube or a one of the half-dozen similar accounts.

It seems like, at some point a few years ago, all these accounts and sites (as I said, mainly Youtube accounts) were nuked from orbit. While the majority of content on these accounts were public-domain music, not all of it was, and it's not unreasonable to assume there was maybe a copyright strike or something. But... at the same time, past mass copyright strikes usually were followed by the rights-holders monetizing their archives, and I've not yet seen any company putting up large archives of prewar music on Youtube or any of the main streaming platforms for *any* amount of money.

So... what happened anyway? Is anyone familiar with the details?

And has any archive appeared to at least partially replace what was missing, or are all the magnificent collections of prewar music once again scattered and lost? Just seems like an enormous loss to music historians and fans of early music to have had such an accessible collection for maybe the first time in 80 years only to lose it all again.

1felvyg,mentalhealth,2024-09-11 21:37:04,i survived a genocide but i feel nothing i managed to evacuate from gaza leaving behind the rubble the bodies and the memories of the war zone youd think getting out would bring relief a sense of safetybut all it brought me was emptiness i thought once i escaped id be able to feel again to grieve for the lives lost for the people i knew but i feel nothing im in a place far from the violence now surrounded by people who are living normal lives they go about their day complaining about trivial thingstraffic their jobs relationship problems and i just stare at them how do they not realize how absurd it all is i survived hell saw children torn apart in the streets watched families disappear overnight and now im expected to care about small talk i dont even after i got out people wanted me to share my story to talk about the horrors i escaped but every time i do i feel detached like im telling someone elses story i describe the destruction the bodies the screams but it feels like im reading from a script i cantonnect to it anymore its like i left my emotions back there buried under the rubble ive lost all sense of empathy when i hear about someone dying even someone close it doesnt register i didnt cry when i found out a friend of mine didnt make it out i didnt care when i heard about others losing everything i go through the motions pretending to sympathize but inside its just blank people think escaping the genocide means survival but its not true part of me died there and the part that made me human never made it out now when i see images of whats still happening or hear about others struggles i cant bring myself to feel anything i walk past people begging for help and i feel no urge to stop im broken in ways no one can see on the outside im functioning i smile i work i talk to people but inside im just as destroyed as the streets i left behind its been months
hzcmoq,mentalhealth,2020-07-28 10:58:53,my dad shot himself today i dont know where else to put this but i need to get it out today my dad killed himself he had been battling depression for a long time today he got way too drunk he was a recovering alcoholic and got in to a big argument with my mom they were fighting on the front porch while i was in the kitchen making a bottle for my mo son who was sleeping in his crib on the other side of the house after they were arguing my dad walked in to the house shut his bedroom door and shot himself in the head i was right outside the door when it happened and i cant get the sound out of my head luckily my son slept through the whole thing and was quickly taken out of the house by his father while i called my eyes hurt but i cant sleep or close them with out everything replaying through my head i feel like my life is in pieces and i dont know what to do thats all i can really say if you need help please get it because of a horrible combination of alcohol guns and depression my son no longer has the grandpa that he so much adored and i am now with out a dad edit thank you all so much for all the sentiments i know its strange to post something so personal to random people but hearing from all of you makes me feel less alone i guess i agree about therapy and i am definitely no stranger to it and the help it gives sadly money is tight and my insurance is shit so if anyone has any resources to help me find a cheaper solution when it comes to therapy i would be very grateful

ge1dz0,mentalhealth,2020-05-05 16:51:39,i think that reasons why is a very bad way of spreading awareness as the title suggests i think that rw is a very bad portrayal of mental health suicide depression etc and it shouldnt be promoted as a show that raises awareness when its just harmful it portrays suicide as something beautiful and meaningful and not what it really is and the whole blame it on other people even though they tried to help me thing nope nope nope thats so toxic idk if i just feel that way because of my ptsd an older guy blamed me for his suicide attempt because i didnt help him enough even though i did everything i could and was only but its just not really how suicide should be portrayed in my opinion also the way they show flashbacks of hannah baker from when she was alive makes it seem like shes still alive in some way they reeeeally push this harmful suicide is something you choose as a weapon to hurt other people agenda when in reality suicide is often the exact opposite idk personally i really dont like that show and i think its harmful i once opened up about my suicidal thoughts and depression to a friend and she was all like who made you feel that way like it was other peoples fault like sure trauma and toxic relationships with people can worsen suicidal thoughts and depression but i just dont feel like the show portrayed it in a helpful way
kpvok5,mentalhealth,2021-01-03 23:22:47,i know it sounds cliché but its crazy how much a walk outside can clear your head and get you back to at least a neutral state if not a positive one i know that the starting of something like a walk in the moment seems impossible but i just hope if youre feeling down and you see this that it can be that small nudge you need have a wonderful rest of your day

k7mxc8,mentalhealth,2020-12-06 04:28:29,just had my cousins memorial on zoom and it was atrocious my cousin recently killed herself we were close when we were growing up her parents were extremely strict and had very high expectations of her expectations she obviously felt she couldnt meet im pissed off because in her memorial not once did they mention it was a suicide the closest thing i could find to an acknowledgement of that fact was in an obituary posted elsewhere online where they said she succumbed to the pressures of covid which is the most bullshit way to sugarcoat a suicide they couldve come up with as someone who has been very very close to taking my own life having been hospitalized for that very reason just last year it bothered me to my core that they pretended like it didnt happen just sang songs about god beating around the bush and making it clear that she would be going to heaven and not hell even though everyone knows she did the big bad and committed sin no recognition at all for the pain she had obviously been dealing with silently for her entire life i posted on her memorial site just a quick blurb of some memories i had with her a nice photo of us when we were young and i quick sentence at the end basically saying some of us face our struggles silently and you never know who could be fighting an invisible battle so always be there to lend a shoulder to someone whether they ask for it or not and i linked nami and the suicide hotline they fucking deleted my post and asked me to take all references to suicide or struggles out they reached out to my parents too to try and reign me in im honestly appalled they seem embarrassed and ashamed of her and they want to hide what she did because it makes them look bad in the eyes of god fuck man wouldnt even let a supportive message and a link to nami slip in there had to be clean and without any reference to mental health whatsoever i feel so bad for her if her parents made me feel this invalidated in one fell swoop i cant imagine what her life was like with them just needed to vent thanks for reading

4pl3yc,Fitness,2016-06-24 04:52:45,things i wish i knew years ago ive been seriously lifting weights for eight years now looking back at when i first started i did so many things wrong but it took me a lot of trial and error to get where im at today by no means do i know everything now not even close i finished school with a bs in kinesiology and got my cscs from the national strength and conditioning association and will start my masters program in the fall there have been many times where i was deadset on being right about things only to later find out i was wrong thats the beauty of exercise and strength training continuing to learn and grow you should never be complacent with what you know buy books read articles ask around your gym you can only benefit from this you can add to what you already have in your arsenal and become a complete package here are some things i wish i knew when i started years ago disclaimer this is mainly directed at beginners but some of these things may be new to you even if youve been lifting for some time just because your numbers are going up doesnt mean youre doing the exercise right i remember hitting plenty of milestones in regards to benching squatting and deadlifting however i would later find out little things i was doing wrong that could have led to injury fixing these minor tweaks made the exercises much harder but i felt much stronger and safer because of them mobility work is extremely important after a couple years of lifting i was at the top of the world i was bigger stronger had more confidence etc however i didnt realize how tight i was and how that was restricting much of what i did in the weight room and in my life if you dont know much about mobility do some research thoracic spine mobility shoulder mobility hip mobility ankle mobility the list goes on and on look up people like kelly starrett eric cressey matthew ibraham and others they all have youtube channels and their attention to detail in regards to range of motion stability and mobility are some of the most useful and eyeopening pieces of information you can find never underestimate the power of warming up i see a lot of people walk into the gym do a couple of shoulder circles then jump into their workout i used to do the same thing however once i started adding in dynamic warmups and prehabmobility exercises before lifting i noticed a worlds difference consider the exercises youll be doing that day and work on those areas before you hit the weights compound movements really do trump all this was a hard lesson for me to learn i used to do the typical backbiceps chesttriceps shoulderstraps legs split which depending on your goals isnt necessarily a bad thing however once i switched over to pushpullleg splits i really noticed a change in my body cut down the isolation work focus on exercises that will truly challenge your strength stability and coordination pull ups chin ups bent over rows squats deadlifts rdls overhead presses benchincline bench pushups dips cleans snatches etc those are the exercises that should make up the majority of your workouts find ways to make them harder if youve already mastered them not only will your strength increase but youll look even better the best core work you can do in terms of both safety and results doesnt involve crunches and russian twists just hear me out on this one i used to do the usual ab exercises sit ups crunches leg raises russian twists side bends etc while these will all work your abs they do little to nothing to help your overall core stability start using movements that will help you in your other lifts and they will strengthen and grow your abs as well these movements refer to antiextensionflexion antirotation rotational movements etc ive been doing these exercises for my core and have noticed my other lifts improve because of them in addition to being extremely sore the next day hanging leg raises pallof presses landmine rotations woodchops planks on a stability ball rollouts wheel or stability ball dead bugs bird dogs back extensions dragonflys rotational throws plank slides with gliders side planks farmer carries overhead carries l sits etc a lot of these can be done on one knee or can be made harder by taking away an arm or leg basically any exercise that challenges your bodys ability to stay stable has a profound effect on your overall strength and still give you that ab soreness that so many people desire even though thats not what were afterbut you know what im saying another note on this people tend to think of the core as just your abs but your core is actually all of the structures that support your trunk and limbs this includes your abdominals obliques shoulder joints hip joints lower back muscles etc by strengthening these areas you improve your trunk rigidity when your trunk rigidity increases it allows more freedom of movement from your limbs all proximal tightness will improve distal rom kettlebells are awesome i avoided kettlebells for a very long time up until these past few years talk about a gamechanger kettlebells allow you to do some crazy movements thatll challenge your body in ways that you didnt think possible kettlebell swings are towards the top of my list not only are they great for glute strengthpower but it has a carryover effect for teaching proper hip hinge mechanics and is a great tool to add in for high intensity conditioning turkish get ups windmills clean and presses onearmed presses goblet squats great for beginners and many other exercises challenge you in a unique way if you havent tried training with kettlebells i recommend you start now cardio really really really does not have to be a drag i know a lot of people have recently moved away from the long duration treadmill elliptical stairstepper and biking trend that has dominated the fitness culture for so long but a lot of people still limit themselves to just that circuits and hiit are truly superior if you want to add in cardio work not only is it faster but its way less boring and much more fun and effective some ideas of exercises to use for your conditioning prowler pushes kettlebell swings rower intervals ball slams both front and side to side plyometric work speed ladders tire flips mountain climbers box jumps sprints battle ropes jump ropes sled pulls with a rope working primarily your back etc these will not only leave you gassed but also work your entire body instead of just your legs the possibilities are endless writing out or following a detailed workout program will get you to that next level i cant tell you how many of my workouts in years past consisted of me walking into the gym and meandering from exercise to exercise sure i walked out with a nice pump but how did i know i actually made any progress when i follow a prewritten routine i go into the gym on a mission i know what im going to do how many times and how much weight ill use this really drills discipline into you some days you come in feeling sluggish but if you have a routine set up you know that you must finish what you wrote down otherwise youd probably cut your workout short having a specific goal changes your mindset completely tracking your progress keeps you honest and prepared looking back on your numbers and seeing them increase is an awesome feeling look into programs like starting strength phat just to name a few or if you feel competent enough write up your own take progress pictures track your numbers it is essential for success learn your damn anatomy a lot of things really started clicking for me once i began studying anatomy and physiology although it may be boring once you learn about where each bone is where your muscles originate and insert how the contraction process takes place etc then you will start viewing lifting in a whole new light biomechanics is a big one too these things can change how you lift and help you pay more attention to your technique for instance you know you need to keep your elbows back to target your triceps during dips but do you know why did you know that your pec actually inserts onto your humerus arm bone therefore when you keep your arms close youre essentially taking the pec out of majority of the movement not only will this help you but it will help if someone ever needs advice or has any why questions do your muscles flex well no they dont your joints flex and extend your muscles contract and relax find out the function of each muscle what muscles contribute to elbowshoulderhipknee extension and flexion and youll learn a lot of new things look up websites like getbodysmartcom which have great illustrations of muscle function and placement nutrition and sleep really are as important as people make them out to be i know i know everyone has heard this by now but i had to mention it just google the benefits of sleep if you dont know them but they are substantial nutritionwell i could write an entire essay on that subject alone but you must and i mean must make this a priority over everything else if you have your nutrition on point everything else will come with relative ease dont undermine its importance breathing mechanics are important this is one that ive really had to learn to incorporate lately and im not talking about the typical exhale when exertingusing concentric contractions and inhale during loweringeccentric contractions im talking about proper breathing and rib alignment google or youtube proper breathing mechanics and setup breathing is a great exercise to use most of us here are chest breathers when in reality we need to be using our diaphragms this will change the way you do pretty much every exercise film yourself im adding this one a day late because it totally slipped my mind last night theres a difference between what you feel like youre doing and what youre actually doing the best way to find out the truth is to film yourself from the side this is such a big help especially if youre wondering how your form is try to have a friend film you squat or deadlift in slow motion and watch the video carefully look at how you initiate the movement ifwhen you start rounding your back how your head position looks etc or you can even film yourself doing these exercises in your room with no weight although it may sound weird doing certain exercises with a shirt off will actually show you the muscles themselves moving and if you do an exercise from a rear view you can see your spinal mechanics at work its really an interesting thing to do and will help you spot any errors and correct your form thats all i could think of for now but im sure theres a lot more i figured if it was longer than this id lose your attention unless i already lost you a long time ago like i said earlier by no means do i know everything not even close but in order to be the best you can be in the world of physical fitness you must continue to learn and experiment be proud of where you are but ask yourself what aspects youre ignoring or could improve much love rfitness im constantly amazed at the amount of support and passion you guys have for the subject and each other edit some helpful websites and articles kelly starrett youtube channel eric cressey youtube channel matthew ibrahim youtube channel stack youtube channel alan thrall youtube channel todd durkin youtube channel mark rippetoe youtube channel edit getting a lot of specific questions regarding whats best for warming up and mobility like ive stated the internet is your friend if you want to know how to warm up for a squat or bench press just youtube bench press warm up or squat mobility there is so much information out there google and youtube are goldmines for finding stuff like that edit did not expect this to receive so much attention but im happy that you guys found this to be useful im off to bed but will be more than happy to answer any questions tomorrow feel free to message me with any specific commentsquestionsconcerns as well id love to help

7nrqkz,Fitness,2018-01-03 03:01:21,finally hit lbs lost then got under lbs then square inches of skin was removed months of recovery its a year i wont ever forget m sw lbs weight before skin surgery lbs cw lbs edit im i realized i didnt have that in here this will be my final post on this unless something major happens in the future once again i want to thank rfitness for all the support youve given me this past year i truly appreciate it and hope i can repay it in kind justshowmethephotos beforeafter photos tldwtr aka ive got a minute give me the juicy details so it has been year since i hit my lbs loss months since i got below lbs for the first time in my adult life and just over months since i underwent skin removal surgery where the removed sq inches of skin to make it short it has been one crazy year this post is both an update for all of the above plus an update on my dietexercise plan as per the rules the surgery went well but as you can see from the photos im kind of lopsided my right side did not turn out as well as my left as far as weight i have maintained my lbs weight loss throughout the entire surgery recovery and now as i work to regain what strengthmuscle i lost below is a very abbreviated backstory the original is still available here and the second update is here quick background i wont rehash the whole story again as the original posts from last year are still available links below when i was a kid i was told i would never be fat by the time i graduated from high school i was lbs starting my junior year of college i moved to main campus weighing about and reached by end of the st year on campus second year on campus was when i reached my recorded max of lbs it is likely that i weighed more but the figure is the highest i found logged by a medical office so it is the one i use diet for the years i have stuck to iifym which is in my humble opinion the best out of the options ive personally tried approximately calsday cutting after the surgery i was told i had to eat so i reverse dieted to to aid recovery but this translated into eat all the foods since i didnt really have anything else to do this did put some fat back on me since all i could do was sit and walk short distances but i did maintain the lbs loss for a year now and have never crossed back into that i shoot for g of foodbased protein minimum regardless of diet or supplementation even on cheat days but i usually get more like g a day fat is usually under gday carbs make up the rest typical meals breakfast g oatmeal sweetened w splenda piece of toast from heiners calorie bread preworkout large apple lunch oz chicken breast g sweet potato protein bar rarely but i prefer ones that dont go under a calg protein ratio eg cal bar w g protein dinner oz lean meat veggies and i end the days eating pm with a single serving protein pancake w sf syrup kodiak dark chocolate is hands down the best imo i dont personally believe in supplementation just a personal thing but i will drink some myproteinbrand bcaas after a particularly difficult workout but nothing else i do occasionally use protein powder but it is usually to cook with not drink and when i do get some it is usually myprotein or on brand exercise my approach to fitness given my age is functional with a heavy slant on looking decent i would like to have abs just one time in my life just to look like the classic male however over the last few weeks i have realized that i just wasnt putting my all into it i realize that technically i am still recovering from a massive surgery where the front of my body was split in twain but i never get sore anymore i rarely mix up my exercises i didnt add in new ones i did a strict split and just tried to put up more weight i told myself that insert exercises i was good at exercises is what i could do due to insert bs excuse here and never pushed forward then i met a good friend of mine who is years old years my junior a local soccer star cross country state finalist and still hits the gym everyday he pushes me harder than anyone i have ever met refuses the nonsense of my age until i have actually tried something new it reminds me of my niece who always says i dont like that when you offer something new to eat for me its im too oldweakrecovering for that he doesnt accept that until i have tried if i could give any tip to someone new to this fitnessweight loss world it would be to find someone who doesnt take excuses not because you are paying them but because they honestly know you well enough to see past the excuses to see the person you could be over the last few weeks i have been fine tuning a new program it is still in progress but this is pretty close to the final plan the idea was to move away from a regular split to something that mimicked a daywk split while making it accessible for someone who doesnt have the recovery ability of a year old plus adding in more functional movements and core to each day versus a dedicated day each day is a heavylight split the heavy area being the main focus of the day and the light being a secondary day but no reduction in weight just a reduced number of exercises split i dont have a set repset pattern for any exercise other than reps for the first sets of any exercise then all additional sets are to failure average range of sets is depending on the exercise weight etc monday is heavy chest light back chinups pushups x core exercises tuesday is heavy core light legs pushups chinups x bicep exercises weds is heavy back light chest pushups vacuums x core exercises thursday is deadlifts rackpulls pullovers pushups x core exercises chinups friday is heavy shoulders light arms pushups asst pullups x core exercises sat is heavy legs focused then light full body more or less i workout various things all to failure while i chat and enjoy the day iso bicep exercises sun is rest day breakdown of exercises chest chest press machine landmine press sven press flat bench incline bench back machine rows lat pulldown tbar row iso lowrow cable midrow lat pressdown australian pullups db shrugs ityws db rows lumbar hyperextensions robbery exercise w lb dbs core core twist flutter kicks reverse crunches oblique crunches v holds v ball passes abpullovers hanging leg lift lsit roman chair crunches legs high bar squat goblet squat air squat barbell calf press leg extensions glute kickback machine hamstring curls glute thrusts abdadd press leg press shoulders db scap holds dislocations db ohp bb ohp lateral raises plate raises plate steering use a plate like a steering wheel biceptricep standing db curl preacher curls iso db curls cable curls drag curls hammer curls tricep pushdown tricep cable extension internalexternal rotator cuff cable pulls again these are all the same format reps for sets then everything else to failure with no hard set range average is sets depends on exercise weight etc deadlifts are the odd man out it is reps each set no set limits just until i cant do it anymore or form breaks down usually its sets depending on weight progression the mods asked me to elaborate on the weight progression of my fitness plan given my age im not really chasing the same dreams that the younger people are so my progression is more tailored to overall fitness when i start a new exercise i find a weight that i can do sets with to failure each set and that is where i start however this is not a hard and fast rule some days as i start increasing the weight through the sets i get worn out and dont progress in weight that week my goal is to push to failure each and every time overall i feel this gives a better workout for me and seems to still allow decent recovery as an example i logged my previous deadlift day set lbs x reps set lbs x reps set lbs x reps set lbs x reps set lbs x reps set lbs x reps set lbs x reps i do log my workouts but i dont track of reps i only track that i did a set to failure how many sets i did total and the maximum weight used this is done by putting an x or a dot next to exercise which denotes a completed set then at the end i write down the maximum weight used across the exercise cardio i have slowly added in either sprint cardio sprints on the treadmill usually or some long slow cardio stair climber is still my favorite i do this days a week and i do at least x minute sprints every day but saturday i also do rehabgiven exercises for shoulders knees and back to maintain the health of those areas those are just peppered in throughout the week i wont list these here if you have an injury see a doctorphysio yes it is a lot each day but i tend to thrive on a meticulously laid out plans plus if i overshoot in the plan then ill either overachieve daily or at least hit the mark in execution ive only been lifting heavy again for about months between the surgery and my shoulder so these are my horribly weak post recovery lifts these are for reps of of more not rm flat bench lbs squat lbs deadlift lbs extras i like to hikebackpack swim for distance and i run on the rare occasion but aside from the gym i dont do much in the way of sports whats next you can stamp a big vain on my forehead but i want freaking abs just once also traps my gym mates and i just finished a week addon plan i developed where we did vacuums and pushups every morning i went from barely being able to do pushups to easily being able to bust out in one go everyone whined about the vacuums after the first days but now they are thanking me it really is an undervalued exercise now that is done i am planning to focus on my posture and my shoulders i have some kyphosis in the upper back from years of being a computer geek then later a wow nerd so i want to correct my posture as much as i can which will translate into better stronger shoulders i am also going to have to try and figure out how to get the other or skin removals i will need to look normal my rear flankslovehandle area will absolutely need fixed and my chest will likely need to be fixed until that point i will continue to lose fat and get as functionally strong as i can get faq are you going to lose any more weight my plastic surgeon has recommended i go down to but no lower at that point i should be focused on more of a recomp as you can see from the pictures there is still fat under the skin i need to get rid of as much of that as i can did you have surgery or use any drugsmedicinechemicals no nothing against them i just feel the quick but clearly not painless methods available lack a certain educational value to them sure i can teach someone the techniques to keep off the lbs they lost from weight loss surgery but actually living it for years dealing with failuresobstacles is nearly always the best teacher whats next id still like to climb a mountain maybe mt rainier or mt elbert something with proper snow and requires a bit of technical climbing ive always been a bit of an armchair mountaineer a friend of mine climbed kilimanjaro about a year after a dual cervical fusion plus he is years older than me so what is and isnt possible for me kind of has been thrown out the window did you ever consider suicide i put this on every update i do or anything i post connected with weight loss the answer is yes i have on a few occasions not my finest moments if you are considering suicide please get help there are lots of options for help regardless of where you are in the world you might think suicide will stop what you are currently feeling but it also robs you of everything you could be in the us you can call or go to the nearest emergency room also here is a list of suicide prevention orgs in various countries if anyone has any other questions or comments feel free to ask
4ajtpp,Fitness,2016-03-15 18:48:27,years of lifting never skipping a workout barely drinking alcohol and eating a ton of food i posted my progress pictures on rbrogress yesterday i got so many nice comments that i thought to write about this journey in more detail here initial motivation my starting weight was kg lbs and height cm at years old i didnt grow taller but i grew my physique and the way i live i always wanted to go to the gym i browsed chans fit rfitness and rbodybuilding a lot but never really got around to it there was a gym in my town but it was quite expensive per month for free weight area and a stupid milon circle moving to england almost years ago i moved to the uk swindon and they had a hour gym i thought no more excuses and lets go browsing reddit and other forums i decided to start with stronglifts x stronglifts x this was a great workout to start with i did it for months straight never missing a single workout and gained a lot the beginning is always fast in those months i went from kg lbs to kg lbs i got my bench up to kg deadlift kg row kg and ohp kg i was over the moon i felt stronger shirts started to fit tighter and people started to notice slightly diet my diet at that time consisted of eating a ton of food and whole milk gomad i didnt count calories still dont but i always checked what pasta had the most calories what meat etc that and the additional kcal i got from drinking l whole milk a day had me gaining a lot of weight i stopped doing gomad after my skin started to get bad a lot of pimples and i had to go to the toilet about every hour phul after feeling fairly strong and done with stronglifts i started phul days a week i did this for about months and again saw some nice gains switching up routines has worked really well for me after months i just dont get sore anymore so i change workouts and then i do i did this workout up until like kg lbs diet during these months i again ate as much as possible i was completely done with the milk but started taking weight gainer shakes i bought the optimum nutrition one and took one before bed every night phat after not getting sore anymore from phul i started phat days a week training hard i did this for about months and saw decent results i got up to kg lbs my goal weight you know what happens once you reach your goal you feel great but you want more or at least i do so the current goal then was and still is now kg lbs diet nothing special still kept up the weight gainer shakes every night and just ate a lot moving back to the netherlands my year in england was done i wanted to move back it was as if the god brodin himself wanted me to keep getting gains because in my tiny town there suddenly was a brand new shiny h gym this couldnt be a coincidence day ppl split i started with days a week went up to days a week moved to days a week so now the most logical next step to me was to go days a week so i did with this day ppl split i had been lifting for almost a year now and people told me i looked like i lift achievement unlocked not looking dyel anymore finally so i did this days a week again never skipping a workout and religiously going looking forward to every day diet same old just eat a lot i moved back with my parents so i dont decide whats for dinner anymore i got tired of the weight gainer shakes so i found something even better quark with wallnuts i cant find the direct english word for it but it looks like this its like really thick yoghurt one ml cup with wallnuts contains about kcal and again i took one before bed every night lazar angelovs workout running i started this workout a month ago when i was kg lbs and i am at the time of writing kg lbs this workout is a lot of fun and has muscle group days rather than pull push days which is nice after months doing ppl before starting this workout i took a week off lifting because i had been lifting non stop i hated not lifting and not going to the gym every hour i was thinking about the weights looking at rbodybuilding images of steve cook and calum von moger after that week i started the workout and man i got super sore again running so my new job was on the th floor i take the elevator every day because dom told me cardio kills gainz i took the stairs for fun once and noticed my endurance sucked big time since lazars workout is days a week i got rest days thats too much so i started running just km every sunday diet same as with the ppl split living the quark and wallnuts still ___ supplements i took protein shakes bcaas zma whatever none of them longer than weeks because i just didnt dig the shakes the only supplements i have taken daily and will continue to do so are creatine g multivitamin fish oil i feel like thats all i need pills when i wake up multi fish oil and scoop of creatine before i go to bed sleep hours a night every night i know and feel sleep is important my new job requires me to get up at this is why i am in bed sunday to thursday i religiously sleep hours at least and about in the weekend no alcohol this is an overstatement i sure drank some pints in england with my colleagues but only night a week if i drank friday i didnt drink on saturday and viceversa i barely drink any alcohol nowadays as it just doesnt taste as good anymore i used to love drinking beer with my friends but now i just drink water only water ___ conclusion starting to lift has been the best decision in my life i was always that skinny kid with red hair i was scared of confrontation and i just felt weak now years later people tell me im getting big and starting to look like a closet that probably sounds cooler in dutch someone in that rbrogress thread told me i inspired him or her that was really cool to hear i hope to inspire more people and thats why i wrote this long ass post edit i dont know why my post got locked but i didnt do it thanks for the nice pms everyone and yes i like this manbun for now im not going to cut it off because a few internet strangers tell me to haha edit some of you have asked my instagram snapchat its the same as my reddit username but i dont post a lot just the occasional gym selfie edit so it went kinda viral the lad bible posted it on facebook my reddit friends tell me i look like a cool viking and facebook people call me out on the hair which i wear because i like it and are super mean

cg9c8d,Fitness,2019-07-22 05:53:07,the absolute beginners guide to the gym hello all xb first this is not a post about exercise this is a post about going to a gym i notice that every once in a while someone asks a question about gyms joining them using them etiquette etc i also noticed that there isnt much about using or accessing gyms in the wiki so hopefully this gets added or not if its not useful if youre new to getting in shape and want to use a gym for that i hope this will answer any questions you may have this is based on my personal experience and im sure many of you will have but my gym doesnt do it this way comments so please feel free to comment and ill adjust accordingly without further ado lets talk about gyms xb what and why a gym is a place that makes working out easier its usually a space dedicated to some form of physical activity that allows members to reach their fitness goals gyms vary quite drastically in what they offer how they offer it what they prioritize etc while you dont have to join a gym to get active or hit your fitness goals it usually gives you access to equipment and resources you cant get otherwise like weights cardio equipment pools personal trainers etc unless youre hitting a specific exercise running or swimming for example joining a gym is an easy way to get access to those resources different gyms will prioritize different aspects of fitness and wellbeing most large gyms are allrounders they try to cater to weightlifters bodybuilders yoga enthusiasts swimmers runners etc some gyms are more specialized for example some may have weights only or some might be single function and probably not be called a gym at all wallclimbing yoga studios pilates studios etc what you join should depend on your goals and this guide will cover as much as possible to help you decide and navigate the gyms xb what you would find at the gym the reception almost without fail there will be a desk at the front where someone will greet you and check that youre a member before letting you in the people at the front desk are sometimes also trained as sales people so they might try to sell you stuff but once youre a member theyre there to help you out free weights this will be one of the the most common items youll find in gyms the most basic weight option will probably be a rack of dumbbells but youll also see free weights olympic barbells benches racks and all sorts of muscular individuals hauling these weights around the variety and scale of equipment depends on the clientele with some gyms having a much bigger area dedicated to weightlifting resistance machines these vary greatly in variety and function most will have some sort of weight selection and they will mostly focus on one muscle or muscle group in the workout while not very popular in rfitness they do serve a function and are sometimes necessary for example theyre good for back exercises some of them will have cables some will have complex levers and almost all will have a small guide on how to adjust the machine how to use it and which muscles it targets cardio equipment these are typically treadmills elliptical machines stationary bikes rowing machines and other devices that allow you to perform cardiovascular exercises without changing your location theyll more often than not be seen in rows usually opposite the windows or mirrors as their name suggests they help get your heartrate up theyre probably the easiest to use as you probably can run or cycle bodyweight and suspension area better equipped gyms might also have an area that seems somewhat emptier and allows for more freedom of movement but might have a device like this suspension rack and might have the big bouncy balls or thick ropes attached to racks these areas are designed for bodyweight exercises and will often attract personal trainers or even small group classes in bootcamp format studios a studio is an area that is somewhat separated from the rest of the gym usually by glass walls and doors usually has mirrors on one side and will sometimes have a stage studios are used for things like yoga classes group exercise classes etc you might find yoga mats or exercise balls in there some are specialized they might cycling studios or pilates studios studios are usually open to members if there isnt an active class and theyre good for stretching or warming upcooling down specialized equipment some gyms have climbing walls swimming pools etc its worth asking about these if anything interests you group exercise classes many gyms offer these classes les mills spinning yoga pilates etc these are sometimes part of your membership and are sometimes extra you should check with your gym on if they have them and how you can sign up genderspecific areas other than the obvious ones showers and bathroom some gyms might have femaleonly areas could be a class could be a studio could be a certain time in the week if youre female and would a safer environment you can always ask about these showers sauna most gyms will have lockers changing rooms showers and some will have hair dryers ironing boards saunas steam rooms jacuzzis etc these are not important to everyone but a shower might be worth confirming if youre planning on showering after a workout many gyms will also offer towels a small one to carry around and a big one to dry yourself after showering personal trainers as the name suggests these individuals dedicate their time to just you in the gym pt sessions are usually an hour to minutes each and are designed to help you focus and get better results pts are not for everyone first theyre expensive second they need you to agree on a predefined time and place to exercise third you might not need them if youve been doing this for a while however they can be good if youre an absolute noob and prefer someone to handhold you for the first month or so pt sessions are sold by the of sessions and can used over a specific period check with your gym on what options they may have chillout area some of the nicer gyms will have a lounge area with coffee a juice bar etc available to the members this isnt really related to exercise but having an area like that makes a gym more appealing to some xb cool sound like fun where do i start first find a convenient gym i highly suggest a place that is either near work or near home anything too far will lead to excuses for not going you also need to make sure your gym has the equipmenttimingprice thats good for you google is your friend and i guess yelp once you have one or two options head down before the day you intend to start working out walk up to the reception and ask them for a tour of the facilities and about their pricing options i suggest you go the gym around the time you intend to work out to see how busy it is dont forget to see the showers and lockers before signing up for a longterm contract see if you can get a test run some will give you a day trial some have onemonth options a onemonth option helps you see if a gym is really for you some people will always prefer to runcycleswim outdoors if there are several gyms that are convenient locationwise i suggest you see them all before signing any commitments a small note while in general gyms and gymgoers are welcoming some gym environments could be toxic judgmental showoffy superficial dont be discouraged thats why i suggest trying a gym out for a month to make sure the environment is positive and supportive you need to find a place that youll be happy going to second once youve settled on the gym get ready on the day you want to go wear some comfortable clothes and shoes pack a change of clothes if you need to change a bottle of water and head to the gym i wouldnt initially worry about things like gloves or wraps you wont need those for a while at the reception check in and ask for a towel if the gym provides it and ask for help for whatever youre trying to do if its weights ask them for help with the weight area cardio ask for help with the machines etc the staff should be able to orient you and give you the basics of the gym ask about any special rules use of chalk grunting music etc some have funny rules at this point you should follow whatever program youve researched before remember this is not a working out guide third shower and change and congrats day one is done keep in mind that a gym is not the cleanest of environments so make sure you also wash your bottle etc xb gym etiquette the most important thing you need to keep in mind is that no one in the gym cares about what you look like how much you weight and what exercises you perform having said that a gym is a common area so it pays to be considerate while exercising observe the room see how people wait for machines to be ready how they behave etc look for signs that talk about rules for example some gyms limit cardio machine usage if youre unsure about something ask unless theyre in the middle of their workout most people are more than happy to help the gym staff are there to help so always feel free to ask them as well weights if youre weightlifting youre going to rest between sets if the gym is busy it is good form to share other people can use the machinesdevicesweights while youre resting between sets racks squat bench get busy and sharing helps everyone move more quickly quick note if youre sharing equipmentmachines and youre listening to music male sure you take your headphonesearphones off so you can communicate you need to hear your buddy this is especially important if youre ever spotting someone if youre using a bench or a seat its good form to place a towel where you might sweat on it and wipe it down after youre done before grabbing weights from a machinebar check to see if someone is still using them asking wont harm always return your weights to the weight rack dont be the disruptive asshole grunting loudly dropping weights if youre unsure about something or need help with an exercise ask other people who are not actually working out the big buff guys are probably the nicest as they usually remember what it was like being a beginner some seasoned lifters in here pointed out that dropping weights and grunting are part of the workout thats very true but doesnt mean you get to be an asshole about it is there rubber on the floor is there a deadlift area are you grunting in effort or to show off again its really about being considerate cardio observe the time limit if there are people waiting and wipe your sweat off when youre done studio use return everything you use in there turn off the lights if necessary dont drop weights on the wooden floor body weight area make sure there isnt a class or someone else using the equipment if its an individual ask if sharing is ok if its a class either join insign up or wait for it to finish group classes these usually need you sign up early and your membership needs to include them always put your equipment away after the class is done or wipe your sweat puddle think of people using the gym after you

8ogzss,Fitness,2018-06-04 12:48:47,m how fitness transformed me from an obese narrowminded gamer into a wildly different person m how fitness transformed me from an obese narrowminded gamer into a wildly different person photos before and after photos tldr weight lbs lbs thats kg down to kg time period technically years of weight loss explained in post but the most dramatic changes happened in the past year i started lifting in may of lift progress summary dl lbs x x squat lbs x bench lbs x x ohp lbs x never did rep maxes these are just the highest lifts ive recorded in the gym most of these are from a few months ago when i weighed a few more pounds and my lifting routine was more consistent my lifts are a bit lower now program for the most part i based it on umetallicadpa s ppl program its available in the recommended routines in this subreddits wiki edit a lot of folks in the comments asked for a link to the ppl program here it is disclaimer i didnt truly follow this program as prescribed and to be honest if i had stuck to this program more strictly im sure i wouldve seen a lot better results its very effective but for a variety of lifepersonal reasons combined with some fuckarounditis it wouldnt be fair to the creator to say that i actually followed his program for a full year nonetheless im pretty happy with my progress so far and i owe a lot to this program for giving me my foundation diet as for diet i just tracked my calories with myfitnesspal the specifics of what i ate are not too important but the act of counting calories consistently is the single most important thing i did in this entire journey yes daily calorietracking is tedious yes it sucks but thats exactly why so many people fail at weight loss if you want the results bad enough youll do it anyway a typical day of eating might look like this i skip breakfast most days i guess this means i intermittent fast it works for me because im not hungry in the morning and im always very hungry after work in the evening lunch calories turkey sandwich on thin wheat sliced orangeyellow bell peppers dannon lightfit greek yogurt i like to meal prep this on sundays so its basically on autopilot dinner calories chicken breast oz smallhealthy microwaveable meals usually with chicken think weight watchers healthy choice etc steamed vegetables a few cups of greek yogurt also coffee and water copious amounts of black coffee and water preface first this is probably not the most dramatic transformation youll ever read but this roughly marks year of getting my shit together so it seems like a fitting time for a progress post so much has changed for me in the last year between work life fitness and more and most of it started with discovering the rfitness community a year ago so it felt like the right time to post something second while this post is not about video games some sections will talk about them indetail ill try to mark the sections as skippable for the nongaming audience here but i think there are a lot of folks specifically gamers who might be in a similar situation to the old me so im leaving those details in this story for folks who might be in a similar phase of their fitness journey to where i used to be lastly ill note that i dont believe video games are inherently bad i still enjoy them a lot from time to time its just that in my case my old approach to games reinforced a very problematic and sedentary lifestyle a lifestyle that im now happy to be rid of alright lets begin background how i got fat ive actually been out of shape for most of my life i almost never exercised or thought at all about the consequences of what i was eating i typically ate whatever was either convenient or tasted good without ever thinking about what i was putting into my body growing up i never had any athletic sports that i was passionate about but i definitely did have a competitive drive my main hobby growing up was playing video games a hobby that ive loved since as long as i could remember holding a snes controller in my hands as i got older this drive manifested itself in my gaming experience starting with halo then starcraft hey look at my reddit name then eventually league of legends and more the drive kept me hooked on games i was determined to get better the positive side is that i developed some helpful habits that helped me to get decently good at games i had the discipline to constantly selfcriticize my own play refine my technique and learn from gaming professionals in order to get better than my peers and improve but this drive mindset was a doubleedged sword while the focus was certainly valuable i realize now that i was actually extremely narrowminded i ignored many other critical aspects of my life in favor of competitive improvement it took me a long time to realize this snapping out of it really all began here with rfitness college the weightgain train when i went to college everything got worsewaaaaaaay worse my newfound freedom led to increased consumption of junk food much more heavy drinking i basically realized i could eat pizza and chipotle whenever i wanted so i did just that i was also a chronic procrastinator and had a very unhealthy approach to academics it would not be uncommon to find me in a computer lab procrastinating until am ordering a pizza and then finally doing my assignment despite spending hours constantly procrastinating or gaming i always told myself i didnt have the time to workout because i was constantly behind on schoolwork this led to a significant weight gain i know shocker but i got better at games which was all i really cared about postgraduation when i graduated i weighed about lbs i gained more than pounds while in my years at school now that i had graduated and had a fulltime job i said enough is enough and tried to refine some of my bad habits i cut out major diet offenders no more late night pizza orders no more soda or energy drinks yes id still frequently eat junk food for dinner and didnt track my calories but i forced myself to at least eat a healthier lunch and i began running god this sucked at first i remember i couldnt run a single damn mile not even close i was wheezing and drooping in sweat in less than a halfmile but i just kept going to a local park after work and made running part of my routine gradually the distance increased substantially all these new habits took me a long way i lost quite a bit of weight at least lbs i was feeling good about it eventually even tried on my old suit and my crazy long sleeves made me feel like one of those inflatable arm flailing tube men that you see in front of grand openings success or so i thought but eventually the progress stopped the weight loss halted it happened because it got harder and i wasnt actually pushing myself i wasnt really trying and i also still poured almost every free moment i had into video games from gaming to fitness this section probably wont make any sense to anyone who doesnt play competitive video games so you can skip this section and jump to epiphany if thats not your cupoftea but failing to get promoted into diamond league in league of legends mightve been one the best things that ever happened to me let me attempt to explain i was not just a casual gamer i always strived to be competitive i always wanted to be the best or at least constantly getting better i was addicted to seeing myself improve in order to make that happen i developed a sense of discipline and practice that helped me to climb decently fast i wont pretend i was a league god or anything there are many better players than me but i eventually climbed to top in north america i also colaunched and hosted a weekly podcast related to teaching people how to improve at the game shoutout to anyone from tforcewards who might be reading this and i gave individual coachinglessons and that was all while working a fulltime job with a hour commute often playing half as many ranked games as many of my similarlyranked peers now i attribute my rapid climb to my discipline focus combined with my drive no matter how high i climbed i was a constant student of the game i learned from watching korean pro players who were way better than me id spend hours breaking down what they did to be successful and trying to apply it to my own play i constantly drilled myself in somewhat repetitive tasks and game mechanics until it was almost subconscious to me i regularly reviewed my play or when id make mistakes and was very critical of myself because i wanted to get better and i climbed becausei wanted it i wanted it bad i worked really hard at it i was driven but as anyone who has played the game knows many folks dont truly care about their rank until the season is about to end until theres a deadline that they have to address that was me remember i mentioned i was a procrastinator at the very end of season of league of legends i decided to push myself to get into diamond but i had waited way too long to start as the deadline approached i dropped nearly everything else in my life to focus on climbing i basically sat at my computer all day grinding games practicing technique or reviewing replays eat sleep game repeat i put in a ton of work and saw a tremendous amount of progress in a short period of time butit didnt happen i ran out of time the weekend before the season ended i was a single victory away from winning a promotion series that would have granted me my coveted diamond border multiple times but i didnt make it i was crushed why do i mention this all this gaming nonsense i swear it connects back to fitness here we go when i didnt make it to diamond my first instinct was to get the climb out of the way early in season i was already practically there so i thought this will be a piece of cake with this mindset i became lazy i cut a lot of corners that helped me to climb in the first place and eventually started falling in rank i realized that if i wanted to see the type of progress i needed to climb quickly again i was going to have to invest every ounce of my free time and energy into this game again and then that thought filled me with dread epiphany wait why why should i work so hard for this now knowing how grueling my experience would be to get back to another diamond promotion series with my old approach to the game i asked myself how could i possibly justify it i would have to give up every free moment of my life to get a shiny border on a loading screen for internet bragging rights i decided that id be better off putting my time and efforts into something else i hypothesized that if i put half as much effort into any other aspect of my life as i did trying to climb in video games that i could see tremendous results so i decided to test that theorywith fitness i then quit playing ranked league altogether took a before photo and then read the rfitness wiki foray into fitness year ago many initial struggles i was terrified of attempting compound lifting movements at they gym but i also knew they were important i watched a bunch of youtube videos on proper form and read a bunch of articles on diet most importantly i read through the rfitness wiki multiple times i settled on doing umetallicadpas ppl routine and i started counting my calories strictly a month later wow months and some beginner gains later holy shit this actually works i realized that if you truly work at something with persistence and discipline dayin and dayout then the seemingly impossible suddenly becomes possible and i was never the same again transforming my life with all this extra time i had saved from not grinding video games it quickly became apparent that i should pick up some new hobbies and practices i picked up rock climbing to stay active i got back into playing guitar which i hadnt played in years i pushed myself to be more social and outgoing after years of sitting inside a room playing games until am nearly every evening soon my whole life felt very different over the course of the next year work i got promoted and also joined an awesome new team recently theyre the best social i made new friends rekindled old friendships and hung out with people way more than when i was grinding games i shifted from my narrowminded self that was only concerned with video games who struggled to relate to people to being genuinely interested in other people and their passions its been a massive lifechanger living i gradually transitioned from a recent college grad with studentloan debt living with his parents to an adult who is living debtfree in one of the most incredible cities in the world productivity procrastination stress i realized that a lot of the stress i had and procrastination could be avoided by applying proper discipline and planning by writing things down and properly managing my time with discipline dayin and dayout i often work half as hard as i used to and achieve x times the results in terms of productivity i often think back on how much stress i had during school with procrastination and i now think i could easily get way better grades with half the amount of effort travel last year i went on a twoweek eurotrip with my friends and it was one of the best experiences of my life this photo from norway has one of my best genuine smiles i love doing active outdoor activities now i am planning to travel more in the coming months a brief note regarding fitness girls and confidence a lot of people get into fitness to attract the opposite sex or same sex it was certainly a motivating factor for me initially and yes the gains have helped but really the added confidence i gained from smiling at myself in the mirror in the morning combined with developing a more broad range of hobbies interests did way more for my dating life than just fitness alone if i just replaced my obsession with gaming with an obsession with fitness i doubt i would be as happy as i am now looking forward ive never really bulked before im eager to see where i could be after a full bulkcut cycle but right now fitness has taken a bit of a backseat compared to some other priorities in my life that said im looking to start my first true bulk sometime in the late fall most likely november for now ill continue my weekly ritual of eating at a deficit during the week so that i can enjoy the weekends without as much guilt and still say somewhat lean im probably not going to have a pack at this rate not willing to give up alcohol and other delicious weekend foods right now admittedly that was a pretty hard pill to swallow initially but ive come to terms with it that said i lead a pretty active lifestyle and i dont anticipate ill get too out of shape either and then ill reign it all in and get strict again once i start my bulk so it doesnt get too out of control tips advice that helped me read the wiki i know that this is beaten to death here but seriously do it its probably the most important thing related to fitness that ive ever read consistency is everything fuck motivation this is about consistently about getting your ass in the gym and watching your diet even on days when you really dont want to once you lose some weight remember to buy new clothes that fit you seriously makes a big difference meal prep on sundays eat copious amounts of chicken greek yogurt drink plenty of black coffee special thanks this community especially progress posters you gave me the reinforcement i needed thank you thanks to umetallicadpa for writing the ppl program and special thanks to the mods who keep this place up and running lastly ill just say this if you decide you want it bad enough thats literally all it takes fitness is not complicated theres no magical barrier from preventing you from succeeding ignore any dumb voice or excuse in your head its all bullshit seriously your results are yours and they are there for the taking just start

dl265l,Fitness,2019-10-21 15:28:53,my day dadbod transformation background male yrs started lbs current day transformation before and after photos diet i started by cutting out sugar and sodas i substitute sugar with stevia i stated my macros with a split of carbsproteinfat i choose this macro to ensure i was consuming enough protein in order to minimize muscle loss i made sure to eat approx to gram of protein per lb of lean muscle mass in order to minimize muscle loss while dropping weight when i first started getting serious i was body fat that means i had lbs of lean body muscle lbm and lbs of fat therefore i would consume grams of protein which is approx calories the rest of my calories would go into carbs and fat im a very busy parent and making sure i was consuming enough protein was a challenge so to help out i would drink approx protein shakes daily one for breakfast and another with dinner i usually added bananas or other fruits sometimes i use peanut butter powder i hate water in my shakes and found using silk almond milk sugar free only had calories per oz worked great as a milk substitute lunch usually consisted of oatmeal with cinammon and stevia with some silk almond milk these were my main carbs for the day dinner included a lot of kale salads with veggies i often added tomatoes cucumbers sliced carrots radishes etc sometimes id add tuna or chicken breast if i needed to mix it up or hit my protein target salad dressings were mostly fat free or low calorie approx calories per tablespoons sides included microwaved baby red potatoes with some country crock salt and pepper these were great as i found my hunger would subside by eating potatoes and noticed the calorie to gram weight was a good balance compared to other types of carbs like chips pretzels popcorn or other snacks snacks included nuts plantain chips orveille redenbacher smart pop popcorn celery or an apple calories i made sure to calculate my daily total daily energy expenditure tdee without workouts i then multiplied my tdee by to get my weekly calories so i knew how much i could consume for the week i added to that number to get my maintenance calories subtracted calories so i could lose approx lbs per week and divided by to get my daily calories so at lbs my tdee was weekly that was calories my total weekly workouts added another calories for a total of to calories from there i would subtract calories to get a lb weekly weight loss this meant i could only consume weekly or approx calories daily however it was important that i hit that calorie weekly workout excercise starting around january i was almost lbs barely able to wear size pants and really out of shape i started eating healthier by eating oatmeal veggies salads and less fast food by april i dropped down to i started counting my steps with a tracker and targeted k steps per day by june i was down to where i plateaued for weeks thats when i got fed up at not making any more progress heres what happened next tools garmin vivoactive smartwatch jump rope wahoo heart rate monitor hrm food scale weight scale that calculates fat percentage tape measure the smartwatch helps me track my daily steps and connects to the wahoo hrm when i do activities where i dont want to risk damaging my phone swimming mud races etc jump rope is probably the best tool in my arsenal its cheap and highly effective in burning calories efficiently food scale is a must i needed to know how much i was consuming so i could target how many calories i could eat on a weekly basis the weight scale with fat percentage calculation helped show that i was dropping fat and not just weight tape measure to help calculate body fat using online calculators software myfitnesspal calorie counter garmin connect activity tracker polars polarbeat activity tracker syncmytracks pro android strong android myfitnesspal is amazing i have it connected to my garmin connect account where my workouts and steps are imported from there i can see how im progressing i can track my weight and upload photos as motivation seeing the progress via photos and graphs really motivated me i also use polars polarbeat activity tracker for my workouts primarily because i do heart rate training workouts from there syncmytracks exports my workouts and imports them into garmin connect which uploads them to myfitnesspal workouts ok so ive learned a lot over the last months the biggest takeaway is this long periods of high intensity cardio is not the best for cutting i learned that short hiit sessions are much more efficient and effective heres my routines morning workouts consist of minutes of low intensity cardio this included riding a bike and jump rope i would ride my bike and try to keep my heart rate around bpmfor me that was approx of my max hr in this range approx of the calories i useburn in my workout comes from fat which was my main target not muscle growth after about minutes i would transition to a minute hiit routine where my heart rate is at or more of my max hr afternoon workout consisted of strength training this is where i would weight lift low weights high reps and high sets for about minutes i used the strong android app to track my workouts and see my progress i followed this article as my workout routine for weightliftingstrength training routines very simple to follow thats pretty much it as of now my goal is to hit lbs body fat then start a clean bulk program to build muscle mass i have approx weeks to go hope this helps and if anyone has

around minutes there are great free apps for this type of workout for example hiit interval training timer calorie counting as i wanted to get leaner i cut during these months i was at a calorie deficiency to calculate what my daily macors fatsproteinscarbohydrates and calories should be for good weightloss i used the following formula for my starting weight also taken from the book eat grams of protein per pound of body weight each day eat gram of carbs per body weight each day eat grams of fats per body weight each day for me that became grams of protein per day grams lbs grams of carbohydrates per day gram lbs and grams of fat per day grams lbs you then use these values to count your daily calorie intake carb is calories protein is calories and one fat is calories i calculated about calories per day which i followed exactly during those months and thats all i did simply put my body feels great now and just filled with power when i run i feel springy on my feet when i play with my friends and family i use my body with joy because it feels so strong and that is something i want to convey not only is heavy lifting a great way to get leanlook good if that is your main concern but the changes to the feeling of your body is amazing one of the best decisions i have made in my life the months was an intense workouteffort but once you get there maintaining what you

moderators that i had to remove any mention of the name of the author or his book if i wanted to keep the post up the reasoning behind it is that it could be promotingspamming its extremely unfortunate as all the material i am quoting is his and not mine i thought about it and in the end seeing how the post has been so appreciated by the community i decided it would be the lesser of two evil between deleting the post or deleting the authors name however i dont feel really feel comfortable about it so i dont know if i will leave the post up anyway thank you so much again you can

4aozzf,Fitness,2016-03-16 18:01:55,i recently finished eating and training like dwayne the rock johnson for days mlbs results pics thoughts and the rocks response starting february i began my rocking for days challenge to eat and train like dwayne johnson for days as it ended on a tuesday i finished out the week completing a total of days of the challenge three weeks ago i shared all the details about the eating and workout plan so i wont repeat it here tldr summary after eating calories a day for days more than hours of cardio and almost lbs of cod i gained a total of lb after over hours of weight training i got leaner and gained some muscle in my upper arms most triceps upper legs mostly quads my upper chest you can see it pulled my chest up here are the before and after photos the rocks responses i blogged every day during this month and a few articles got written about the challenge they came to the attention of the rock who had a few things to say on twitter about it he doubted me at first but then came around here are screengrabs of the rocks tweets lifting results i got stronger though i hadnt done much isolated lifting in years so definitely a lot of beginner gains here i probably increased weights around or so just to pick two random exercises for an example in the beginning of the month i started the incline bench at around lbs x and now it starts at lbs i was originally doing the reps of leg press at lbs now its at lbs one change to the workout in week the lack of ab work became quite apparent so i added ab exercises leg raises russian twist and stir the pot more details are shown in the google doc below so no weight gain apparently not i didnt skip a single meal ate every bite and had nothing else besides this food the entire time i thought i would put on a few pounds so getting leaner was a surprise i had never really subscribed to a pure calories in calories out belief and this experience killed it for me its more than how much you eat what you eat makes a huge difference heres a photo gallery showing meal prep how i felt all month terrific even with so much food i never felt overly full every morning i would do mins of cardio then eat oz of cod cups of oatmeal and hard boiled eggs at the gym then weight train i always used to work out on a mostly empty stomach just a shake so i thought this would make me nauseous but it felt good even with all the workouts i never felt sore all the food seemed to be fueling my recovery even the little aches and pains of being in your late s went away i also was serious about stretchingfoamrolling at the end of the workouts so i didnt feel very tight either was it worth it i decided to do this as a challenge to myself to see if i had to discipline to wake up at am everyday do all these workouts prepare all this food in advance eat every meal have no cheating and live my normal life i have no aspirations to get huge like the rock and days wouldnt do it anyway overall it was an extremely positive experience and i highly encourage everyone to push themselves to try something new for a month if i had to do it over the only change would be to take a ton of measurements pictures body scans blood tests etc beforehand would have been nice to quantify it more there seems to have been a nice change in my body fat would have been great to have those numbers anyone want to make estimates would i suggest this plan to others if youre chasing the physical results youre almost certainly better off putting together a routine and meal plan specifically for you its also extremely expensive at day while cod is an excellent source of low calorie low fat protein that benefit doesnt outweigh the cost of say chicken breast what is worth incorporating you could probably eat more as long as its the right foods experiment with increasing your protein and overall calories with good clean food and see what happens this is personal preference but i liked doing cardio first then weights which i had never done its a good warmup and its nice to be done for the day after you lift that last weight mastering efficient food prep is key not having to decide what youre eating at every meal is a pleasure and not having to cook it and with practice you get a ton of return on your time investment i can make meals in about an hour now ill keep prepping food every few days i have eaten mostly keto for years but man oatmeal is delicious starting every day with it moving forward whats next i want to follow a more sustainable version of this program for longer starting with another days so far im doing the same workouts x a week i changed up the diet to have meals no cod and comes in at calcfp so far i have noticed im getting a bit sore now in a way i wasnt before so im going to keep experimenting here to come up with a better version if there is interest in me sharing that diet or putting up an update post after following a tweaked plan for days let me know or if anyone wants more detail on any specific piece of this let me know documents to share in case anyone wants to try any of this here is the full meal plan and workout in a handy google doc i have this saved to my phone and followed it at the gym also here are the food costs nutritional info and a data dump from my fitbit questions thoughts hit me

3hckrc,Fitness,2015-08-17 19:07:21,examinecom breaks down the recent lowcarb vs lowfat study their broad takeaway weight loss does not rely on certain carb levels or manipulation of insulin it relies on eating less their summary as usual dont bother with media headlines this study is not a blow to lowcarb dieting which can be quite effective due to factors such as typically higher protein and more limited junk food options rather this study shows that a lowcarb diet isnt necessary for fat loss and that lowering carbs and insulin doesnt provide a magical metabolic advantage it bears repeating if you even try to apply this study to the real world of dieting choices you will be frowned upon strongly even the lead author writes if you need a broad and simple takeaway from this study here is one weight loss does not rely on certain carb levels or manipulation of insulin it relies on eating less dont be scared that eating carbs will cause insulin to trap fat inside your fat cells
bze0g8,Fitness,2019-06-11 15:38:07,weight loss update lbs to lbs pounds down in year naturally with diet and exercise before and after picture lbs to lbs since a young boy i have always struggled with being overweight and have had countless failed attempts trying to lose it on april rd of last year i decided to finally commit and really push myself to the limit and beyond both physically and mentally i knew this time was different my mindset and determination to succeed were stronger than ever before over this past year i have learned so much about weight loss exercise dieting and myself as a person with the use of ifomad intermittent fastingone meal a day keeping cico in mind and a consistent workout routine i have been able to lose pounds thus far height age years old weight difference in before and after picture lbs to lbs lbs lost exercise i have been doing a bodybuilding routine in order to try to maintain and build as much muscle as possible while i am simultaneously losing all the weight i am so doing a muscle building workout routine has definitely been key for me to help with my physique and not have me looking flat with all the weight i am losing also i workout both lifting and cardio in a fasted state mainly to help burn fat and build muscle more efficiently since i started working out in april of last year i have tried out a variety of routines bro split day ul day ul day ppl day ulppl and have had success with all of them but find the best and most efficient for my current schedule to be the day upper lower push pull legs routine i do this routine while incorporating cardio usually hiit right after i am done lifting on at least of those days typically i also try to stay active on any rest days and get cardio in through sports like basketball soccer boxing or going for a jog whenever i can here is the current routine i am following day upper day bench press sets reps barbell row sets reps db overhead press sets reps widegrip

form of cardio play sports go for a jog etc diet i believe that finding a longterm sustainable diet really is essential not only for losing weight but ensuring you keep the weight off finding the right plan is a person to person basis so i did a lot of experimenting with different dieting techniques if omad keto atkins etc until i was able to find one that i was pleased by and could see myself doing longterm currently i am doing omadif on a high protein low carb diet macros currently i try to keep it roughly protein fats and carbs i am not very strict on these percentages but aim to keep within these ranges as much as possible day of eating most days i am doing omad one meal a day and i have this meal usually right after i workout workout is done fasted a regular day of eating this one meal would be a postworkout protein shakebar chicken usually as my main meat source of protein or turkey beef etc when i can a salad and veggies as well as often as i can to ensure i get my greens in and a good source of fibre then for desert or if i need to get more fibre in i will have a fibre bar kale chips granola bar or protein ice cream which are all high sources of fibre and taste great if i am not doing omad i will be doing intermittent fasting on usually a hour window to eat where i will have the aforementioned foods except more split up i am not really a picky eater so this is what my diet mostly consists of supplements ashwaganda pill form one mg pill before workout when i need an extra energy boost kaizen whey isolate protein scoops gscoop postworkout usually engn shred preworkout scoop minutes before workout conclusion i have really grown mentally and although my weight loss journey isnt done yet roughly pounds to lose i am proud of what i have accomplished thus far through this weight loss not only have i been able to get myself to live a way healthier lifestyle and improve my mental and physical health but i have also found a true purpose and calling for once

2wbm1a,Fitness,2015-02-18 16:07:46,clinically obese to ripped part three hi reddit thanks to everyone for voting me best weight loss transformation of im back for another installment of my journey from fat to fit as requested by many of you this is my third installment of my journey here is the original post from last year clinically obeseclass ii to ripped my goal for this is to offer a simple blueprint that anyone can use when i first began this journey i had no idea where to start im going to highlight all my strategies that have worked in the hopes of helping someone who is in a similar predicament stats sex male age height before lb after lb face gains recap and update back in i was an obese depressed alcoholic smoker after becoming fed up with my sloppyness and lack of dates i started dieting and running on a treadmill i lost lbs quit smoking and drinking and got really skinny having lost so much weight i had accumulated some loose skin luckily i am privileged enough to afford the surgery to remove said skin so i took the dive and got the surgery after the skin had gone i finally felt i could achieve a beach body and decided to enter a physique competition more as a challenge to myself than anything else here i am on stage in october at the iron man natural here is the full album from the event since the competition i have transitioned into my first intentional bulk ever the mental aspect of this is incredibly difficult keep in mind i have been dieting consistently for almost years to reverse that mentality and actually welcome weight gain has proven to be a challenge the beginning of the bulk was awesome i was still lean from my competition but started filling out from the increased calories this gym selfie i took got featured on a fitness motivation instagram account at the beginning of this year my local gym asked me if i would model for them as they needed pics for a new gym website i wasnt expecting this opportunity and was not as lean as i would have liked i agreed to the photo shoot and tried my best to dehydrate and carb load here is the full album diet ive tried almost every diet and had some success with a few of them but the philosophy i choose to follow today is that of iifym or counting macros counting macros is not a diet per se but more a way of eating that makes you aware of what you are ingesting to count macros you use a calorie counter to track all the foods you eat and then look at the macro nutrient breakdowns of those foods and eat in an intentional way that will hit your goal number of carbs fats and proteins in this way you can still subscribe to a more food specific diet but doing so with this strategy makes you conscious of your macros for my show prep i did a classic bodybuilder prep diet consisting of tilapia brown rice and broccoli although i was not iifym dieting i did calculate the macros to be fat carb and protein calories i got incredibly lean doing this but it was unnecessarily difficult after the competition i began increasing my calories slowly by about carbs and fats a week this is called a reverse diet and its purpose is to allow your body to adjust to increased calories without putting on excess fat my current lean bulking macros are fat carb and protein calories ive gained a total of lbs since beginning this increase start and now supplements creatine fish oil multivitamin i have never used steroids or prohormones training towards the end of my show prep when i was reaching low single digit body fat percentages my strength took a steep dive since my show i have been focusing much of my time in the gym on strength i do jim wendlers boring but big strength protocol here is a link to the program and the calculator this program is for intermediate lifters my favorite beginner program is icf x here is a graphic with the specific exercises current one rep maxes ohp lb squat lb bench lb dl lb motivation how do you stay motivated this is the most frequent question ive received from my reddit posts and its difficult to answer originally my motivation was to look better and not be ignored by girls this kept me going for a while but if that were my only motivation i would have fallen off a long time ago today my motivation is intrinsic it comes from within lifting weights is part of who i am its not something i try to get out of the way any more i cherish my time in the gym in the early days to get through times of low motivation i made the gym part of my routine if i didnt think about it i wouldnt think my way out of it after work everyday i went to the gym on my way home instead of being home from work at i was home at because i went to the gym first making myself go was the hardest part things i wish i had known cardioweightsdiet this is the order of importance if an aesthetically appealing physique is the goal diet is the most important part of gaining or losing weight to gain or lose weight in order to achieve an aesthetic figure weight training is paramount cardio is a tool to use in conjunction with diet and weights to help achieve a caloric deficit tracking if your goal is to achieve an aesthetic physique tracking is a must tracking your diet body weight and the weights you lift gives you the ability to view progress and analyze the variables being able to manipulate these variables is essential to break through plateaus myfitnesspal is great for tracking a couple years ago i was sitting on my computer reading posts like this one wondering if it was possible for me to do the same thing it was possible for me and it is possible for you too i am not naturally a fit person the success i have found has come from consistent positive choices if you are thinking about starting your own fitness journey do it youll be glad you did the way i feel is great the way i look is awesome but the biggest difference is the way im treated today i feel a sense of respect from complete strangers and people seem to want to talk to me im still getting used to it but its awesome ill answer any questions you may have im an open book i have no secrets tldr before and after

51foii,Fitness,2016-09-06 15:16:20,clinically obese to shredded transformation continued hi reddit im posting to show my continued progress and provide information to allow others to do what i have done reading transformation posts on rfitness is what got me started on my journey and i hope my own transformation post can inspire others to do the same i owe a debt of gratitude to this community and would like to pay it back by helping others achieve what i have achieved i will answer any question you may have so ask stats sex male age height before lb after lb face gains recap back in i was diagnosed as prediabetic and clinically obese i wanted to lose weight so i started lifting weights and tracking macros i lost lbs and was left with loose skin and got it surgically removed after the skin was gone i decided i could finally get over my fear of taking my shirt off in public so i entered a bodybuilding competition update the bulk after the competition i decided i wanted to add size and get stronger so i started eating in a way that would increase my bodyweight and in turn also increase my strength and size this is called bulking the first bulk got out of hand although my strength had incresed a lot when i cut down i realized that i hadnt gained much size controlled surplus i learned that the amount of muscle i grew during a bulk was not necessarily proportionate to the amount of weight i was gaining our bodies can only create a small amount of muscle at a time so there is no benefit to being in a large surplus of calories versus a smaller surplus of calories the only difference is the amount of fat that is stored in addition to the muscle in a larger surplus the important thing is to be in a surplus this means taking in more calories than you expend in order to allow your body to adapt and get bigger and stronger current condition i have since been bulking and cutting for a couple years i have found a groove where i relax my diet during the winter months and eat how i want while tracking my macros to make sure i am getting sufficient protein as a naturally fat person this results in weight gain i then cut during the spring or summer months here is my most recent winter bulk months and summer cut weeks diet as a formerly obese person i have tried or been prescribed just about every diet out there what i have found to be most effective is the idea of energy balance if your goal is to gain weight you must eat more than your body requires this is a caloric surplus if you want to lose weight you need to eat less than your body requires this is a caloric deficit if you want to maintain your bodyweight you must eat around the amount your body expends in a day this is called maintenance maintenance in order to diet gaining or losing you must first find your maintenance calories you can use a calorie calculator like this one to help estimate this number but this is only an estimate and you will need to use trial and error to find your own personal maintenance tracking weight how i find my maintenance calorie intake is by weighing myself daily and taking my weekly averages if my average weight from consecutive weeks is around the same i have found my maintenance calories it is a moving target and will not be the same at the end of a cut as it was at the beginning of a cut tracking calories once i know my maintenance calories i can gain weight by adding calories to that number or lose weight by subtracting when i begin a gaining or losing phase i always start with increments of calories at a time added onto my daily calorie goals if i was maintaining my weight on calories a day i would begin my diet on i subtract these calories from carbs and fats the tricky part is tracking accurately i use myfitnesspal macros in a caloric surplus as long as i am getting enough protein to gram per lb of bodyweight it does not matter where the rest of the calories come from in a deficit on the other hand it can be important if i am dieting i always make sure to have at least to grams of fat i have gone below and i felt horrible i keep my protein static year round and i eat as many carbs as my goals will allow i like food bulking macros carb protein fat cutting macros carb protein fat supplements creatine fish oil multivitamin whey i have never used steroids training strength training to increase size and strength it is necessary to practice progressive overload this is the idea of handling a higher workload overtime the easiest way to do this is by focusing on strength for this reason i suggest starting out with a strength routine i have done a couple strength routines in the past including and starting strength these are great routines bodybuilding over my lifting career i have gravitated towards bodybuilder style lifting i lift relatively heavy weights with an emphasis on stretching the muscle at one end of the rep and squeezing the muscle at the other end i find that i feel good doing this and do not get injured most importantly i enjoy it by doing this day in and day out i do gain strength progressive overload although not nearly as quickly as i would with a strength routine current maxes ohp lb rm squat lb rm bench lb rm dl lb last tested over a year ago but how how do i motivate myself this is the most frequent question ive received from my reddit posts and its difficult to answer i dont know what motivates anyone else for me i got sick and tired of being sick and tired i read every transformation post on rfitness over and over again until i had an idea of what to do and i finally took action after that i fell in love with this lifestyle i no longer need to stay motivated because this is just what i like to do make it routine when i was obese i worked hours a week and was very tired when i got home the last thing i wanted to do was drive another minutes to the gym what i did instead was brought my gym clothes with me to work i changed in the bathroom at work and stopped at the gym on my way home this way it wasnt a choice i did not need strong willpower every day it was just part of my routine the hardest part is often just getting to the gym lessons learned cardio is not necessary for weightloss in the begining of my journey i ran on an elliptical every day and i hated it what i didnt know at the time was the idea of energy balance cardio worked because it increased my daily energy expenditure and forced me into a deficit what i wish i had known was that those calories i was burning every day on the elliptical could have just as easily come out of my diet one less pop tart would have had the exact same affect on my physique tracking accurately diet is the most important aspect of fitness the way we look feel and perform comes down to diet above all else in order to control this aspect it is important to be able to track it accurately for me this took a lot of practice a behavior of mine that contributed to my obesity and still hinders my diet sometimes is unconscious eating i stand in front of the fridge or a cupboard and shovel food into my mouth without even recognizing it by tracking everything that enters my mouth i am able to recognize unconscious eating and stop myself before i start tracking my diet body weight pictures and the weights i lift also gives me the ability to view progress and analyze variables being able to manipulate these variables is essential to achieving my goals if you are thinking about getting started on your own fitness journey do yourself a favor and begin today my only regret is not starting sooner i have found a new way of life in fitness and it has allowed me to achieve things i didnt think were possible for me thanks again for all the support i am truly grateful for this subreddit ask any questions you may have i will do my best to answer every last one tldr before and after

years passed by when i got my first job and they hosted a weight loss competition and i was like you know what lets try it and finally had the courage to sign up for a gym membership at first it was going good and lost lbs and felt impressed with my self the results came in and i lost and felt devastated and lost motivation my friends still encourage me and said you know even though you lost you still lost lbs which is incredible you should still keep trying and i was like you know what you guys are right so i tried going back but it felt different i didnt feel the same motivation as i did before and i didnt last long and kept on failing over and over and started to slowly gain my weight back and was depressed and went mia because i felt so ashamed years passed by and i moved to saint louis to work at my cousins restaurant to start my life anew to find myself and then one nighti skyped with one of my best friends and when i saw him i was so shocked because he been trying to get fit too and he looked amazing he progressed so much and i was like wowand we talked and he gave me good advice encouraging me and etc all night i was thinking wowim really jealous think i couldve looked

4wgai3,Fitness,2016-08-06 15:25:29,the keto diet is a very low carb high fat diet that has a lot of misconceptions and can be daunting to try so i made this beginners guide explaining what it is why to do it how to go about it and my personal experience with it including progress pics i recently published a comprehensive guide for people who have never heard of the keto diet or want to know more this was very well received on rketo and im sure rfitness would benefit as well from this information because diet is one of the most powerful and effective changes we could make to manage our health i tried to do my best to make sure i portrayed this diet in a responsible wellrounded manner with all the proscons so here goes link all about the keto diet a beginners guide edit the post was removed due to some selfpromotion rules so i must adhere to them by probably summarizing the content of a word article okay so here goes what is the ketogenic keto diet the ketogenic diet is not intended to be a temporary diet for weight loss although it works great for that but it is more of a lifestyle change where you consistently and drastically reduce the amount of carbs you ingest it not only makes you burn fat for energy more on that below but helps you become very aware of how rampant and ubiquitous carbs are in this day and age why is it called ketogenic the word ketogenic is made up of two words keto and genic the prefix keto is short for ketones the suffix genic is the same as genesis which refers to the creation of something so the word ketogenic literally means the creation of ketones ketones are created from the break down of fat for energy when the body doesnt get enough carbs when the body is creating ketones it is said to be in a state of ketosis where fat becomes the main source of fuel for energy rather than sugar glycolysis what the fuck are ketones ketones are like watersoluble fat molecules that can cross the bloodbrainbarrier and provide energy for the brain there is this myth where people say that you must eat carbs because the brain can only survive off carbs or glucose what they dont know or conveniently forget to mention is that the brain operates perfectly on ketones as well think of them as the th macronutrient after carbs protein and fat how is ketosis achieved ketosis is achieved by practicing strict carbohydrate restriction consistently the general limit is about grams of net carbs a day which is far lower than the typical grams most people ingest per day net carbs are carbs minus fiber those carbs must be replaced with healthy fat sources it takes a few days for ketosis to actually occur because you have a glycogen supply to get through initially but one can reach ketosis faster if they exercise note one can also reach ketosis if they starve themselves completely of all foods but that is not ideal or recommended what were after is not starvational ketosis but nutritional ketosis which is achieved in the same fashion by simply restricting carbs what are the benefits of being in ketosis the promises of a ketogenic diet are quite impressive helpful for metabolic syndrome obesity and preventing diabetes increased meal satiety and appetite blunting this diet is more satiating than a lowfat diet and tends to makes it easier to avoid caloric overconsumption greater rate of fat loss due to state of ketosis rather than glycolysis note you literally become a fatburning machine reduction or complete elimination of type diabetes reduction in insulin resistance reduction or complete elimination of hypertension high blood pressure improved lipid fat profile ldl the bad cholesterol particle size increases which is a good thing the smaller ones cause more damage the size of ldl particles may be more important than concentration of ldl cholesterol recent studies have shown independent relationships of levels of ldl size to risk of heart disease prevention of various cancers and reduction of cancer growths the mitochondria of cancer cells are damaged and require x the normal amounts of glucose to replicate at rapid rates they cannot utilize ketones and cannot survive in ketosis without the presence of excess glucose possible treatment for alzheimers another study possible treatment for parkinsons improved memory for older adults reduction or complete elimination of chronic systemic inflammation a ketogenic diet has profoundly antiinflammatory effects improved cardiovascular health very high musclesparing effect muscle loss is mitigated in ketosis even at a caloric deficit proven treatment for epilepsy more effective than current medications without the side effects you can extrapolate that if its helping reverse the diseased conditions of people with type diabetes cancer heart disease epilepsy alzheimers and so forth that it may proactively help those of us who are not afflicted by those conditions and want to avoid them before i continue the ketogenic diet is not a panacea the truth is that there is not a single perfect diet that works for everybody in regards to this diet specifically dom dagostino says that this diet is excellent for of people out there but of the population does not respond well to this diet btw dom dagostino is the expert that originally got me hooked to trying keto he calls ketones the th macronutrient in this podcast with tim ferris weight loss is not guaranteed on keto you still need to be wary of your total intake of calories and counting your caloriesmacros is recommended until you figure out the diet but after a lot of experience many people find the keto diet to be liberating because they are able to maintain the diet without the need for calorie counting by consistently choosing only ketofriendly foods why do you have to restrict the carbs so sharply how does the body transition to burning fats for energy i wrote a ton on that topic and im just summarizing here so heres a tldr infographic so what are carbohydrates carbs are sugar sugars are carbs there are simple carbs monosaccharides and complex carbs polysaccharides there are also sugars found naturally in foods and extra sugars added artificially to foods in the context of a ketogenic diet theyre all pretty much the same because the body eventually breaks them down into their simplest forms regardless the carbs that you will eat will come almost entirely from veggies or nuts on this diet dont we need carbs for energy despite your body needing to break down carbs first and foremost when they are ingested carbs are not an essential nutrient an essential nutrient is one your body needs to survive because it wont be able to make it on its own but your body readily creates sugar from fat and protein to regulate blood sugar levels many people think they need carbs to perform at their very best performancewise but thats not true either it takes a few weeks but after someone becomes completely adapted to the ketogenic diet they become very very efficient at burning fats for fuel and the bandwidth or throughput within which your body can do this at is great its been ingrained in us that we need carbs to survive or perform at our peak as athletes we see sugar as energy we see athletes drink gatorade so we think we cant perform at our best without it we almost rely on it as a crutch but when youre ketoadapted you are not chained to the hypoglycemic rollercoaster im only a quarter way through the article and its only summarized the key points but the rest of the article talks about whats wrong with carbs which foods are high in carbs all grainsbread rice pasta cereal starchy veggies potato chips vegetable chips pita chips cookies crackers ice cream pudding cakes donuts soft drinks none of it and fruitsfruit juices except berries and avocados a rebuttal to people who say i like food too much how to calculate how many net carbs a food has total carbs minus fiber what to eat if you dont eat carbs how sustainable is such a relatively restrictive diet how do you eat out can you get all the proper nutrients off of it how does one create a well formulated keto diet isnt this diet expensive what are all the proscons of this diet progress pics calories inout only eating at a simple deficit in i lost fat and muscle keto only but on the keto diet because it is muscle sparing i lost fat and retained muscle again this was only an abridged version of the whole thing if you want to read the full article with photos and full text go here all about the keto diet a beginners guide and please remember that diets are an extremely complex subject there is no perfect diet and its not all about just doing something for weight loss diet is influenced by culture religion social influence family ethics for some its as simply as drinking soylent and nothing more for some they view it through a lens of biochemistry and physiology and geek out over metabolically hacking their body its all about finding out what works for you on the keto diet i was able to sleep well and have good recovery between strengthskill training sessions and felt a constant state of mental focus i still do ive been keto for like months straight now with months total experience so its nice to be able to share what its all about in case it jives with anyone
cdvug3,Fitness,2019-07-16 11:34:30,lifting is not a video game edit if it isnt clear from the source at the top and the tag at the bottom i did not write this i just thought it was powerful and worth sharing wise words from purple spengler there was a time in my life when i was the biggest world of warcraft nerd that you can imagine it was around the middle of the second expansion that i got exposed to the concept of theorycrafting or minmaxing and it revolutionized how i played not just that game but all games instead of simply playing the game i also played a metagame of spreadsheets equations simulators math numbers and i was able to achieve character power and success i never had before i lay this groundwork so that what i am about to say can land more strongly because i am a nerd and not just a dummy meathead or whatever who is shouting and drooling nerds ruin everything its been a long time since my wow minmaxing obsession days but i still remember how to think that way and its because i do that when i read questions like this whats better for functional strength powerlifting bodybuilding or strongman should i do or gzcl how can i optimize my ppl routine when do you become an intermediate all i see is this should i play a warlock or a mage or a shadow priest should i be arms or fury whats the best in slot gear at tier for my ret paladin fuckin rerolling thats what is my gearscore high enough to do heroic icc to put it in the vernacular hi my name is john and i hate every single one of you if youre not familiar with the term minmaxing its shorthand for minimizing weaknesses maximizing strengths the concept is to build the most powerful possible character with what youve got often also determining the best things to get in practice what this boils down to is little more than doing a bunch of math which works out pretty well because thats what many games especially rpgs are based on and for the most part this strategy is incredibly successful across many different games there are parts of it that can even be applied to aspects of real life with success so people get into a habit of thinking this way and then they get into lifting and try to think the same way but theres a problem lifting is not a fucking video game and you people need to stop because you are driving the rest of us insane minmaxing is touted as being a strategy for making strong characters but in my opinion what its really about is removing as much effort from gameplay as possible this does not just apply to the dudes who make twinks not that kind to steamroll the game even for people who try to build the most powerful characters so that they can tackle the hardest possible content are still ultimately trying to reduce their effort level fundamentally minmaxing is about trying to frontload effort through thinking doing math planning and acquiring the right gear to reduce the impact that their gameplay can have on their success it is about determining the perfect way to create a character that can be as successful as possible as quickly as possible just by virtue of knowing all the pieces where they come from and exactly how you will acquire them and in what order in advance before you even truly do anything in the game itself does this sound familiar to anyone this is reason number one that lifting cannot be treated like a video game the rule is out in force and for my money one of the top three of what gets you the its really more like imo alongside consistency and time is effort minmaxing is about transmuting future effort in execution into present effort in planning so that by the latter you have reduced how much is required in the former but this is backwards and wrong success in lifting is heavily tied to effort in execution and only tenuously at best to effort in planning focusing on having a perfect training and diet plan while leaving the execution of that plan as a given is flawed at best and selfsabotage at worst ive said this so many different ways that i feel like a broken record but i truly believe it needs to be hammered on again and again effort trumps intelligence the time to focus on your effort and execution is not after you have created a great plan and it fails as you would when minmaxing it is from day it sounds stupid to have to say that video games are nothing like real life but apparently on some level people dont understand this and it is reason number two to please for everyones sanity stop treating lifting like an mmo the entire practice of minmaxing hinges completely and on all inner workings of the game being both completely knowable and infinitely replicable if dicksocks puts the same gear on his character as warlockmasterxxx the math and equations that determine their characters potential damage will always be exactly the same and both of them can always know exactly what those equations are how any of the potential random factors average out on a certain timescale and even what the most optimal rotation or priority list of spellcasting is but human beings are not rpg characters that are built on math equations you cannot take jim and bill and put them on identical training and dietary plans and have their results be exactly the same ever there is simply too much variance at every possible level and too many factors that are unknowable this should be obvious but every single day people behave as though they dont understand that they are not an orc warlock finally there is an inherent attitude of minmaxing that is incompatible with the pursuit of lifting as always the context of this is having actual goals the attitude i mean has many facets and can be described in a many ways but one i feel that captures a lot of them is when can i stop part of the strategy of minmaxing is about minimizing the grind from character creation to the highest levels and acquiring the best gear as rapidly as possible because it is not until this point that the real game actually starts minmaxing treats the process of a character growing as a waste of your time a barrier that must be torn down if you think of leveling up or iteratively improving the power of your gear as a parallel for training it becomes about trying to skip as much training as possible but this again is completely backwards and ties back in to the first point about effort avoidance skipping training is wrong you want to train more not less in a game you can come up with character builds that manipulate numbers and allow you to walk into a level lay waste to it and rapidly advance through the game but there is no such thing as a secret training and diet plan that is so well planned out so firmly based in science that it removes so much effort while giving you such rapid results because effort and time are primary drivers in results you cant through the magic of perfect exercise and food selection skip the years of consistency and effort it takes most people to achieve their true goals in the way you can blast from level to by dumping a bunch of experience gain gear onto your character i see this way of thinking fuck with people constantly everyone ive ever tried to help with any fitness goal who was a nerd first they have this exact same problem and i say all this because i have been there too and for me it was only because i figured out how to break myself that i ever got down to the brass tacks of actually busting my balls in training and accomplished anything real the challenge is not simply to understand that this way of thinking is not compatible with every pursuit and why but it is more importantly about learning how to find the switch in your head so you can turn it off sometimes i dont have any advice to offer there other than to say that i know theres a switch because i found it but ive only got a map for my own head upurplespengler
2ny75f,Fitness,2014-12-01 16:12:01,this week i turn as a personal celebration heres my two year transformation from pounds progress height body fat face progress full two years full yeard since people keep mentioning it for the first eighteen months of this i was kind of winging it at the gym and just trying to eat right to the best of my ability i plateaued at lbs and couldnt seem to make much more progress it was then that i began seriously reading these forums and discovered all types of things involving nutrition and fitness most importantly counting calories i decided i wanted my abs to be visible i learned that for this to be possible a body fat of or less was required so in june i downloaded myfitnesspal and began counting my calories it was also then that i adopted a vegan diet at first for nutritional benefits and now for all sorts of reasons my average caloric intake over this period ranged from to per day i was experimenting for the first three months or so now it seems as though allows me to lose the amount of fat that im comfortable with here are my most current dietary goals diet calories per day protein g carbs g fat g calories per day was my goal with cardio included i am realizing the macros dont add up frequent foods breakfast lunch dinner and snacks werent planned whatsoever i would pretty much just eat throughout the day whenever i was hungry the key was sticking to reasonably low calorie foods and keeping the cheat meals at a minimum cereal bananas baked beans boca burgers gardein products tofurkey products nugo protein bars white or brown rice lightlife smart dogs steaminbag vegetables soy almond coconut and flax milk cheating whiskey craft beer taco bell i know diet soda not really a cheat but kept my sanity supplements creatine beta alanine various types of soy rice pea and hemp protein powders exercise ive been doing ppl pushpulllegs for the last seven weeks with this last one consisting of a deloading phase here are my daily routines for the first six weeks monday push chest shoulders triceps bench lbs x shoulder press lbs x tricep pulldown lbs x mile run abs ab roller planks tuesday cardio mile run wednesday pull back biceps deadlift lbs x chin ups body weight x cable row lbs x dumbbell alternate curls lbs x mile run abs ab roller planks thursday cardio mile run friday legs quads hams calves squat lbs x calf raise lbs x dumbbell lunges lbs x abs ab roller planks saturday off sunday cardio mile run reflections lessons learned advice to be brief there are two very specific things that influenced my change and neither of them involve fitness if you care to know they are the films of terrence malick and the music of tool specifically lateralus i mention those unrelated influences to highlight the fact that a desire for a nice body isnt necessarily a prerequisite to significant physical mental or emotional health i wanted my life to improve those two things were my conduit but i soon did realize that my health would eventually need to improve at least somewhat for me to be comfortable hell my original goal weight was when i reached that i kept going i felt a hunger and addiction because the results were tangible and i could feel myself changing in every single way all for the better in reading these forums the one thing ive taken away is this do not believe everything you read here or anywhere else there are absolutely wonderful things here especially in the faq and certainly from various posts ive read over the last six months but do not believe or adhere to any one thing experiment with your own body do not be discouraged if something is working wonderfully for someone but doesnt seem right for you its incredibly discouraging to strive so hard at something and fail miserably i will tell you that ive tried countless different exercises and routines both dietary and physical and am just now starting to figure my body out a long time ago i read someone say anyone who has exercised for less than five years is a beginner and i called complete bullshit on that statement now though two years into this myself i am starting to see his point your body is so complex that its utterly mindboggling so many people want such a quick fix it simply doesnt work that way it takes effort it takes time it takes dedication if you allow these three things to work in conjunction with one another you will see and feel results moving forward this week i have started a clean slow bulk that is to say im eating cals above maintenance upping my protein and following phul powerhypertrophyupperlower my plan is to do this for three months cut back down for three more and see what ive managed to accomplish i have never been more excited about any aspect of my life than i am for these next six months although it was not the original spark fitness has absolutely changed my life thanks for reading valuable tools myfitnesspal set your dietary goals track your calories and see results over time mapmyrun track your running stats set goals participate in challenges you can sync this with myfitnesspal and it will automatically deduct your calories accordingly jefit find andor create your own lifting routines allows for graphs and charts to track your progress frequently asked questions comments do you have trouble getting protein being a vegan no juice no your lifts look like shit and insert broism here my lifts were for maintenance purposes only and were set at very moderate weights accordingly most of my focus was on diet and cardio did you drink alcohol yes but put limits on myself one craft beer per night tops with one or two small glasses of whiskey tops i plan on cutting it down to the weekends during this bulk do you have loose skin yes but pretty minimal it is visible when i sit down how much could you run when you first started out for the first month or so i was unable to even run for straight minutes consistency is key i can do a k without being remotely winded now should i do cardio before or after weights in my experience absolutely after weights this does not apply to leg day though dont do that
cgh8tk,Fitness,2019-07-22 18:48:27,my month transformation first off i am so proud of the hard work and dedication everyone in this sub shows you have all inspired me and because of that id like to pass on my thoughts routine and results tldr months lbs lbs bf bf current goal bf longterm goal bf up to lbs pics stats progress pictures sex male age years old height before i started cutting lbs current weight last weigh in lbs goal weight not necessarily a goal but i would think i need to lose another lbs to get to my bf goal of percent longterm goal body fat at lbs wouldnt that be a dream background ive been going to the gym regularly for most of my adult life but it wasnt until march that i decided to seriously take a look and dedicate time to understanding my body and seek assistance for diet macro counting and splits i thought i could do this work on my own but when my macro counting has been terrible i didnt know how to do this it was overwhelming and quite honestly not very intuitive to macro count i was putting waaaay too much into my body and when the scale kept going up i truly wondered why my body wasnt changing the way i wanted frankly needed it to do my lifestyle was fairly sedentary id go hiking occasionally but outside of the gym times a week i didnt do much but sit even when i got home from my days have been twice a day at the gym early morning target cardio plan below and what that means and then heavy lifting in the afternoon depending on how i feel this is usually six days a week current lifestyle im a software consultant sitting behind a desk days a week my life outside of working out two times a day six days a week is pretty sedentary even today so i have to be hyper aware of my nutrition and ensure that my food intake is as clean as possible actual workout at the beginning from march through june i was hitting every major muscle group around once a week my splits would look something like day legs day delts target cardio day back day chest target cardio day arms day delts because theyre stubborn target cardio day high intensity interval training hiit cardio present tracking the photos i knew what areas were weakest my trainer put a plan in place to help adjust to focus more on my weaker areas so my splits changed also note i added targeted cardio daily to the workout routine to help cut more cardio consists of at least mins targeting heart rate at bpm my bodys fat burn zone side note targeted cardio can be done walking on a treadmill its boring so find some music tv anything to get through it the other thing is what works for me may not work for you know your body its limits and what you can accomplish and what areas you need to focus on my trainer has been a huge asset in helping me understanding my own body and what areas i need to work on day legs midback target cardio day chest target cardio day backbiceps lat dominant target cardio day deltscore target cardio day legstriceps target cardio day chestlight delts target cardio day high intensity interval training hiit cardio abs my delts and lats continue to be pretty stubborn and im slowly realizing ill always have to go after them in the gym multiple times a week overall diet i am a creature of habit my diet is pretty boring especially when i find something good i usually keep it in my week for that reason im just going to show my macro counts because im not eating anything special i adjust my macro intake based on what muscle group im working on larger muscle groups will have higher carbs and protein smaller groups will be higher fats and protein low carbs back and legs large muscle group i try to consume around kcal which will consist of carbs proteins fats armsrest day smaller muscle group calories kcal which consists of carbs proteins fats chestdelts smaller muscle group calories kcal which consists of carbs proteins fats get a food scale game changer meal prep in general is a struggle for me it takes me about two hours overall on a sunday i know not that much but my god time is so limited thats the last thing i want to do so crafting recipes that i can throw in a slow cooker rice maker insta pot has been a life saver supplements i take lcarnitine for fasted cardio larginine g preworkout bcaa g ratio during the workout glutamine g post workout glucosamine before bed super greens powder for when i didnt feel like i didnt eat enough vegetables that day my thoughts takeaways so im a little more than four months in and im scared i dont want to go back to that person i was in march its such a short amount of time im scared that i could go back to that person any minute i know i wont be able to maintain these incredible results long term its going to get harder and come more slowly so i know i have to readjust my expectations seeing the current results and progress is so addicting i love seeing my body transform its like a science experiment where i get to experience the results first hand i feel incredible i have more energy more stamina i fall asleep in mins when i go to bed i was always hitting high blood pressure for my age and i check my blood pressure periodically and my blood pressure is all in the normal ranges now the biggest challenge of this process is knowing and being honest with myself six days a week twice a day is very hard i may feel like shit after a day at work and i have to know my body am i fighting exhaustion or am i just in a bad mood if its exhaustion its fine i can take a day to break or i can go after a nap and its going to be alright another challenge behind this is the social aspect people are mean when it comes to this journey socializing going to dinner and drinks after work i will find anything on the menu to fit my dietary needs for the day i dont want to put anyone out but i often find people dont like it when i say im going to eat a salad or i wont drink alcohol at a happy hour i can brush it off for now if you have thoughts behind this

abwgs5,Fitness,2019-01-02 19:06:02,each new year i post here for those of you taking up swimming for improvement exercise or weight management this year i am sharing swimming secrets of long time swimmers like myself that you never see written elsewhere and noone explains hi all i am mod of rswimming and an experienced marathon swimmer over thirty open water swims greater than k i usually post some advice here each new year to assist new and improvng swimmers and people hoping to use swimming for exercise and weight management swimming is a sport that when done consistently will allow you to pursue it for an entire lifetime and reward you for doing do rswimming is a great resource especially if you use the search bar as there is almost no question that hasnt been asked and gotten an answer previously heres last year advice here ive said previously that there are no tricks or secrets in learning to swim but its not entirely accurate about other aspects of swimming these are secrets in that experienced swimmers know them but it can take a long time for others to learn these are the nuggets of knowledge that get passed in changing rooms and on decks and are part of what we might call swim culture this should help collect some of the soft knowledge that experienced swimmers gain over time and so many new and improving swimmers havent yet learned especially if they are not part of a swim group lane etiquette by far the most annoying thing for swimmers are people joining the lane who have no understanding of lane etiquette used around the world by experienced swimmers actually this often includes the lifeguards on duty many of whom most in my experience dont understand either below are four simple rules yes i know as a beginner you think this is too much but people dont play golf with a hockey stick so i dont know why nonswimmers think swimming is different here is a comprehensive explanation of lane swimming etiquette if you are inclined ask or let the swimmer already in the lane know you are joining dont start swimming or turn in front of a faster swimmer the fastest swimmer has the right of way stay aware of what everyone is doing to avoid collisions and frustration for all goggles because every swimmer in the world has an opinion and will happily entertain long discussions about goggs no antifog will last on goggles longer than a couple of months spit into googles for a simple reasonably effective antifog never touch the inside of the goggles use a water baby shampoo mix swirl it around and rinse it out for a more effective antifog most high visibility open water goggles arent high visibility and are seriously overpriced the google design offering the most visibility are clear swedish goggles aka swedes which are also the cheapest more expensive goggles does not in any way mean better blame triathletes for the escalation of costs the best goggles ive bought in years were in lidl the summer before last there is no such thing as a generic best google answer competitive swimmersonline swimmers most often respond vanquishers or swedish goggles vanquishers are not available in europe anymore swedes which i wear myself in the pool and i show you how to fit here arent a good idea for beginner swimmers i also wrote this article about understanding the different kinds of goggles so you can choose based on your own requirements rather than others opinions because i had never once seen anything like this by any of the goggle manufacturers or anyone else silicon straps dont last long bungee straps are a great replacement two thirds of my swimming time is spent with my face underwater exhaling i can see everything including guys jerking off teenagers and older couples fiddling with each other and numerous erections technique front crawl the name of the stroke is front crawl freestyle means that in competition you can swim any stroke and since crawl is the fastest it mostly gets used so a lot of swimmers think crawl is freestyle and visa versa someone will probably even say in the comments here that noone calls it front crawl front crawl is extensively used outside the us and is the accurate term blabt is the acronym for the process most swim experienced teachers use to evaluate stroke and teach front crawl it stands for body position get horizontal in the water not being horizontal is the most common reason for swimming slow push your chest forward and down into the water try to swim downhill keep your head low and steady dont allow it to swing to the side imagine you are an a rotisserie spit that enters through your forehead your whole body rotates around the centre point if you raise your head itll cause the rest of your body to sink clench your butt cheeks core muscles are used for position and rotation doing this helps engage them legs in an elite swimmer the maximum propulsion that comes from kicking is only of overall speed but to do that requires the bodys largest muscles and disproportionate amount of energy long distance swimmers like myself do very little or no kicking fixing the kick is important for beginners so the legs dont slow you down or cause you to sink kicking wildly especially common in runners or triathletes is more likely to cause you to slow this is also part of the horizontal body position above from what i have seen most triathlete swim coaches get this completely wrong and spend far too much time focusing on a better kick you are not riding a bicycle kick from the hips with only a little movement in the knees new swimmers often have a big wide kick or their legs sinks or both this slows them down while reading this see if you can point your toes like a ballet dancer if you cant start stretching your ankle while watching tv or while sitting at a desk not being able to point your toes while swimming is like pulling a weight behind you try swimming with your toes clenched into a fist yes just like die hard this will stop you kicking from the knees you wont be able to do it all the time but it will help you understand what your position and kick should feel like arms reach forward further still pull back underwater but only when your palm is facing backwards behind you not when they are facing the bottom this called the catch when your hand starts effectively pulling keep pulling then pushing backwards until your thumb scrapes your thigh try to always keep your elbow above your hand at every point in the stroke this is not easy and take a long time to get right breathing exhale underwater hum a little to get used to controlling your breath and exhalation try sinking to the bottom of the pool with no arm or leg movement this will help you learn breath control only do this when there is a lifeguard present rotate your head out of the water dont lift it dont look forward or around there is no forward visibility as part of standard front crawl and learning this is a separate activity timing both arms and legs alternate and all actions are smooth and continuous breathing is to the side rotate your hips to drive your arms to reach forward swimwear buy your swim suits one size smaller than the size you think you should wear based on your street clothes because water causes fabric to expand you cant see it but others can wear your swimsuit in the shower after your pool swim its easiest way to wash out the chlorinated water suits will last up to four times longer polyester suits lasts longer than chlorine tolerant fabric and feels largely the same swimsuits are currently in a shrinking phase that is getting smaller male briefs are becoming more thong like with very narrow side panels female racing suits are getting cut much higher at the rear you can find different cuts but it can sometimes take a bit of work never wring the water out of your swimsuit it will weaken the fibres and seriously reduce its longevity simply squeeze it or use a suit spinner if there is one available baggy board shorts should not be used beginner and many intermediate swimmers have problems with drag board shorts add even more drag and make improving your stroke even more difficult if you insist on using baggy shorts please wear something tight underneath because i have seen too many scrotums and assholes and im not even a paid professional how you look or feel in a swimsuit does not correlate with how well you swim there are three materials for swim caps cloth latex and silicone cloth is comfortable but otherwise useless usually used by hotels to keep patrons from getting hair in filters latex lasts moderately well but snags hairs more silicone which is most expensive lasts longest but is also thickest and may be too warm for some people no swim cap lasts for ever though i never get more than a year from a cap swim caps will last longer if your dry them between uses and better yet sprinkle with talcum powder if you have a problem with the swim cap coming off your head while swimming look for ones which have parallel ridges running around the inside edge pool hygiene pool swimming took a leap forward in the s once reliable swim googles became widely available and training sessions for olympic swimmers were able to last for metres or even a whole hour goggles are essential for pool swimming because most pools use chemicals to make the water safe i have a longer post explaining the interactions of pool chemicals and people in more detail here pools that have a strong chlorine or chemical smell are less clean than pools that have little or no odour the less the chemical smell the cleaner the pool water poolwater colour has little relationship to pool water quality most pools use pool tiles to make the water look blue some even add small amounts of copper into the water for the same reason just because youve read that swimmers pee in the pool doesnt mean you have to but if you do want to stay being a swimmer you should probably reconcile yourself to the fact that you are absolutely swimming in dilute urine if this is really troubling you best of luck with your sex life it may not be chlorine thats making your eyes burn the pool may have the wrong water acidity high or low sodaash is added to pool water to control this of course if there are too many organics sweat urine etc in the pool then more chlorine must also be added to balance the pool food drink peeing cold air in the pool deck or changing rooms cold showers etc evaporation of water from skin all cause the skin temperature to drop this raises blood pressure as less blood flows and the hormone that suppresses urination is reduced all this causes you to need to pee more its completely normal therefore swimmers need to be more careful about hydration experienced swimmers will always drink during training yer mammy was wrong you can swim after eating all marathon distance swimmers like myself have to eattake nutrition during swims for example however your body will be using air to digest food and use energy for exercise at the same time so you will feel sluggish at best effort diet it is extremely common that new swimmers regardless of or more likely due to prior experience in other sports underestimate the overall difficulty of swimming and overestimate how much energy they are expending if you havent mastered breathing and are desperately out of breath this does not mean you expending significant energy calorie consumption rates in swimming given by website apps or wearable fitness trackers or watches cannot be trusted because the variables are too varied weight water temperature stroke experience rests set and session duration all play a part i could say its almost certainly less than what any of those are telling you for an hour swimming pools are lower than body temperature and conduct heat away so your body does start using energy to retain heat the effect lasts after the swim is over this makes swimming an appetite enhancer swimmers notoriously eat a lot for beginner swimmers you need to learn to control this most people with a good but average diet will have sufficient energy in blood and liver stores to sustain two hours of high intensity exercise so it is not essential to preload in advance of daily swimming how much should you swim how much you should swim depends obviously on your goals however since swimming is technically difficult skill it is safe to say than more swimming is better but how much as a general guideline i recommend four times a week metres at a time is a good aim beginners wont be able to swim anywhere near this distance so lets say minutes a session injury other physical problems swimming is low impact sport with little chance of causing injury this is a widely repeated misconception apart from the obvious front crawl injuries to the shoulders do occur caused by overuse and poor technique you can get injured with only a small amount of swimming the best ways to reduce the risk are to improve your technique and always do a little backstroke each session backstroke is a stabilising exercise for front crawl it helps strengthen the opposing muscles in the shoulder muscles to assist in keeping your shoulders balanced it does not have to be a good technique to be effective does sleeping on your side cause discomfort the cause is almost certainly tendonitis this will not get better by itself or with rest or by reducing swimming i recommend some deep tissue massage direct icing and physiotherapy in that order as required with massage ice fixing ninety percent of problems water in your ear is easiest dislodged by bouncing on the heel of the leg on the same side as the water if this doesnt work have a shower and stand with your ear up under the water if this doesnt work try a drop of rubbing alcohol surgical spirit wear ear plugs if this is a repeat problem asthma prevalence is correlated to regular swimming the simplest and most effective treatment is to use your daily preventer that you may not want to use daily chlorine sensitivity causes very runny nose sneezing sore red or streaming eyes the simplest and most effective treatment is to use a nose clip they take about one day to get used to and are effective okay folks im off to the pool my log resest itself from last years million metres and im once again back to the start second small edit doubtless there will be questions since im in ireland and i am going swimming and itll be llate late after i finish im not going to be able to answer much sorry there are more than sufficient swimmers here now to be able to answer most any question remember the best swimmer in the one having the most fun small edit ive been asked about my flair here previously waay back in the early aeons of rfitness when all the mods were different the then mods applied flair to some contributors to indicate their expertise in particular areas i was then the only channel swimmer here at that time iä iä cthulhu fhtagn

37ylk5,Fitness,2015-05-31 14:28:32,a linear progression based ppl program for beginners to start a motivational quote errybody wanna be a bodybuilder but nobody wanna lift this heavyass weight r coleman anyway there seems to be a bit of a conflict between conventional training wisdom for beginners day a week full body linear progression ssslgreyskull only and what beginners actually wanna do in the gym every day biceps and triceps woo what im going to write here is an attempt to reconcile these two ideas and produce a sane way for a beginner to train more frequently and give the attention to the glamour muscles that they want while also progressing in a correct appropriate manner to do this im going to borrow wisdom from a few different programs and ideas my goal is to provide an accessible program for beginners with enough volume to stimulate growth in the bro muscles while also giving enough intensity in the main movements to elicit strength adaptations first some nomenclature x in this case it reads three sets of ten repetitions x x this reads as two sets of one set of at least but as many as possible more to come on this later ss this reads as superset two exercises performed back to back with no rest in between supaset bb barbell db dumbbell woah what do you mean by accessory work and main lifts the main lifts are just the first exercises of the day and these are always going to be done heavier than the other lifts of that day the lifts that follow are accessory lifts designed to build muscle balance out weakpoints and improve your strength in the main lifts but i dont care about strength i just wanna be jacked and tan who doesnt wanna be jacked and tan i mean honestly but strength progression is important especially as a novice for making you more muscular generally speaking the more you can lift the bigger youll be progressing your main lifts will also have carryover effects to your other lifts as well if you can bench press lbs you can sure as hell bet that youre not gonna be incline dumbbell pressing lbs and who do you really think is gonna be bigger the version of you who can bench lbs or the version of you who can bench lbs what is linear progression put simply linear progression means that if you were to graph your weights the line that you would end up drawing would be straight like this this means that you need to add weight workout to workout every workout you can make progress very quickly this way if youre a beginner because your body doesnt need much stimulus to adapt as you get more advanced you need more stimulus and more time to adapt see this handy graph from starting strength to get a better understanding of what i mean what is ppl ppl is just the initialiasm of push pull legs or pull push legs it really doesnt matter which this will typically have you doing workouts times per week push this can just be thought of as moving things away from your body think of a bench press pull this can be thought of as moving things towards your body think of a row legs im not going to bother with an explanation here why do i need to progress like this because of progressive overload without this you wont make any adaptations strength gains or size gains you will always start the day with a heavy barbell exercise and this is what you need to progress linearly if you remember from above this means add weight every session then afterwards you will follow up with higher repetition exercises that are more bodybuilding based what is the program its days a week you can run it one of two ways pplrppl or pplpplr where r denotes a rest day depending on your schedule and preferences it really makes no difference personally i would run the program in the pull push legs order you say to add weight linearly but how much weight do you add per session kglbs for upper body lifts bench press row overhead press kglbs for squats kglbs for deadlifts now without further ado pull deadlifts xbarbell rows x x alternate so if you did deadlifts on monday you would do rows on thursday and so on x pulldowns or pullups or chinups x seated cable rows or chest supported rows x face pulls x hammer curls x dumbbell curls push x x bench pressx x overhead press alternate in the same fashion as the rows and deadlifts x overhead pressx bench press do the opposite movement if you bench pressed first overhead press here x incline dumbbell press x triceps pushdowns ss x lateral raises x overhead triceps extensions ss x lateral raises legs x x squat x romanian deadlift x leg press x leg curls x calf raises finer details amrap sets and progression of accessories so the first movements are done for sets of and the final set is whats known as an amrap set as many reps as possible this doesnt mean that you can just yolo it and push until you cant push anymore by as many reps as possible it really means as many reps as possible while still maintaining good form you dont really want to be grinding too many reps since you want to keep rep quality high if you want a good reason to keep rep quality high watch this recent video from omar isuf the point of the amrap set is that it really gives you a chance to test your limits and if youre feeling good on a specific day you can get in a couple of extra reps but the real moneymaker from this comes in when you deload progression of accessories should be done as so when you can hit sets of with good form add weight as long as youre in the range for your sets then youre good if not lower the weight how do i know what weights to start with i dont like the stronglifts x idea of starting with the empty bar because i think the empty bar is useless for training purposes if youre capable of lifting a lot more the mechanics of a lift especially the squat for me change a lot with weight i would recommend starting with the bar and gradually adding weight for sets of until the bar slows down then back off kglbs and this is your starting point so if you worked up to a kg bench press before the bar slowed down at all start at kg warmups idea courtesy of ugawd im a big believer in just practising the movement as a warmup so you can use bench press to warm up for bench press or squats to warm up for squats you get the idea the goal of a warmup is to get blood into the muscles and joints that are going to be used and also to start drilling the motor patterns into your body for form purposes as an example if youre going to be benching lbs as your top set for that day your warmups could look something like this empty bar x lbs x lbs x lbs x lbs x x warming up is a very individual thing however so do whatever you want to get yourself prepared for the lifts if you like foam rolling great if you like some dynamic stretches and things like clapping pushups great do whatever you want to do the only recommendation is that i would avoid static stretches before lifting rest rest as long as is needed between sets for a general guideline i would recommend minutes between your first exercise of the day minutes between all your other exercises dont worry too much about rest times and worry more about just getting all your sets and reps in failure failure is part of life and since lifting weights is a lot like life failure is also part of lifting weights at some point youre going to fail failure can occur really for two reasons not enough sleep food or recovery if you spent all night partying and chasing pussy with your wing man jim beam youre probably not gonna perform well in the gym in this case dont count it as a true failure and just try again next time when youre fresh strength failure this is when youve reached the limit of your progression if you fail a session times in a row for example if you fail to hit x on squats at kg times in a row you need to lower the weight this leads us to deloading deloading is exactly what it sounds like taking weight off the bar take off your working weights so a kg squat would go back down to kg and work back up this should give you a good chance to push things on the amrap final sets if you got x and x at kg the first time round you can bet your ass that youll get more than on your last set the second time round and by the time you work your way back up if you can hit kg for x x kg for x will be trivial my gym or garage doesnt have xyz what can i do instead this section as recommended by ularivalita so basically everything here is interchangeable except the main lifts the squat bench press deadlift overhead press bent over row if you can do those in your gym not in a smith machine then you can make this program work treat it more as template than gospel some ideas for substitutions are the following and if anyone has other suggestions im happy to add them to the list pull substitutions seated cable rows can be replaced with dumbbell rows or tbar rows face pulls can be replaced with rear delt flyes and band pull aparts not one or the other hammer curls and dumbbell curls can really be replaced by any curl variation its a curl shit aint that serious push substitutions incline dumbbell press can be replaced with landmine press triceps pushdowns and overhead extensions can be replaced with any general triceps exercise skullcrushers lying triceps extensions dumbbell triceps extensions whatever you want to do legs substitutions leg press can be substituted with front squats leg curls can be substituted with glute ham raises calf raises can be substituted by nothing because who gives a flying fuck about calves anyway not srs any kind of calf raise will be fine here how to modify this to fit your goals this section as recommended by utheedoor if you want to lift heavy weights there are a few things i would recommend here utheedoors advice of for example if you want to be focused a bit more on strength replace x rdls with x rdls add weighted dips and weighted chinsupspullups in the x range with bodyweight back off sets is brilliant if you want to lift heavy weights then you need to lift heavy weights i know this sounds stupid but it makes sense the more time you spend in the lower rep ranges the better youre going to be in those rep ranges so if you want to lift heavy weights then feel free to alter the compound movement accessories so your presses your pulldowns or rows your romanian deadlifts or your leg presses to be in the lower rep ranges x is perfect for things like this in my view the isolation accessory movements should be kept in higher rep ranges because joint wear and tear can creep in here and getting a pump is fucking awesome specificity is also pretty key if you want to lift heavy weights if you want to be a good bench presser then maybe incline dumbbell press isnt going to be as specific as doing a close grip bench press instead is if you want to substitute some of the again compound accessory movements for ones that more closely resemble the main lifts then be my guest if you want to increase endurance keep the first exercise the same up the rep range on everything else reps is a great range for increasing endurance if you just want to be jacked and tan keep things the way they are theres enough volume and a decent enough mix of volume and strength to get you big as long as youre eating enough if you feel a specific bodypart is lacking throw in a couple of extra sets for it ideally isolation so think along the lines of pec deck or biceps curls not bench press or rows so that youre not adding too much systemic stress which could affect recovery times whats more important form or weight idea courtesy of unobody both nobody got big benching plate regardless of how good their form is you should push the weights up and continue progressing as long as your form is acceptable demanding that your form is perfect all the time as a beginner is just not possible so as long as your form is acceptable and not injurious then continue adding weight as an unknown lifter once said the best way to improve your form at lbs is to make lbs part of your warmup i can guarantee that when youre squatting lbs for reps that your form at lbs is picture perfect this is complicated theres a lot going on how do i keep track of this its something i hadnt thought of since i have a borderlineautistic savant memory for things i do in the gym but here is spreadsheet created by umobius which will make tracking this a walk in the park can i do this program while cutting sure you can do anything while cutting so try it out i suspect that recovery may become an issue due to the volume so if you are struggling to recover and feeling like shit drop some of the volume x becomes x for example taper the volume off as little as possible and keep the volume for the main lifts as high as you can for as long as you can can i do ab work on this program yes i would recommend doing ab work on your deadlift days and your squat days if you want to do ab work nothing major just do a few sets of weighted planks or a few sets of ab wheel and some hanging leg raises next steps a few people have requested this so i thought i would write out what i think logical next steps from here are this is a beginner routine for beginners intermediate and advanced lifters cant make linear progress like this anymore and require some more advanced training in order to progress questions courtesy of ufattestrabbit what are some signs that you may want to graduate from this program put simply when youre no longer a beginner a beginner lifter is defined as someone who can make progress workout to workout if you deadlift kg for reps then the next time you deadlift youll be able to deadlift kg for reps once this linear progression stalls out and you take longer to recover between workouts because the weights are heavier and therefore the systemic stress is higher you become an intermediate lifter an intermediate lifter is someone who needs weekly progression in order to maintain progress programs like the texas method for example can you adapt this program for intermediate lifters how far can this program take you if you upped the weights and moved more sets to x instead of x yes you can adapt this program for more intermediate lifters but i wouldnt like to try and formalise something like that the more advanced you get as a lifter the more you should be realising what things are beneficial for you and figuring out what works for you because everyone is a bit different in the beginner stages this stuff really isnt too important because almost any beginner will make progress doing almost anything i would recommend looking at progression schemes that are in things like the texas method madcows x and for your main lifts and then just sticking with fairly similar accessory work more volume almost always equates to better gains provided you can recover from it moving more sets to x wouldnt necessarily have a huge impact on your abilities to lift big weights in the main lifts and heavier sets in my experience tend to impose more wear and tear on the joints if youre an intermediate lifter then go for it try it out it may work for you intermediate lifting should be all about trying things for yourself and getting to know yourself better as a lifter what are some next logical programs to try after this one texas method madcows x phat phul ugzcls jacked and tan any program designed towards intermediates that are in line with your goals pick something you think youll have fun with unless this shit is your job or you really want to compete seriously then just have fun in the gym and dont do something too retarded and youll probably stick to it better than something you hate and go to the gym with more drive and intensity im a big believer that consistent effort is probably the most important thing you can make sure of powerliftingtowin is a great resource for training information and programming information so i would recommend reading a bunch there can i do this routine only once per week you could and thats all im gonna say i wouldnt recommend it because thatd put frequency of all the lifts at only once per week if you can only run it once per week then i would recommend something like greyskull lp stronglifts x or starting strength instead for increased frequency

3yxetl,Fitness,2015-12-31 16:58:39,hated how i looked and felt so i did something about it months progress pics details more first photos and stats height age before after photos starting weight lbs kg current weight lbs kg tldr decided to get healthy and in shape before i turned years old and did something about it lifted weights counted my calories and worked hard no special diet program just simple stuff that almost anyone can do summary a little over months ago i looked at myself in the mirror literally and figuratively and i didnt like what i saw i was a year old very overweight lacking motivation and confidence my energy levels were low and i knew it was effecting my family wife and kids i was tired of it and wanted to finally do something about it ________ phase lose fat asap march june months eat healthier smaller portions i knew i was super over weight so i needed to lose fat i used loseit app and counted everything that went into my mouth i calculated my tdee total daily energy expenditure using online calculators and adjusted my calories about every weeks lift weights i started lifting weights with a friend of mine who had already been lifting for a few years he taught me the ropes and helped introduce me to some starter routines during phase i did a basic push pull legs ppl routine i split this between days per week m t r f light cardio i did about minutes of cardio times per week after lifting weights just for some cardiovascular health and to help with the weight loss macronutrients i aimed for about g protein daily and then didnt really count my carbs or fat calories i ate anywhere between calories a day example daily meals meal egg whites eggs cereal meal oz chicken sweet potato veggies meal preworkout protein bar meal oz protein carbs and veggies cheat meal every days id have a cheat meal note not a cheat day just a meal this meal i would eat whatever i wanted as much as i wanted usually itd be a couple greasy burgers chinese or a pizza these meals gave me a little something to look forward too and also helped push off my weekly cravings favorite meal qdoba you can get a lot of protein packed into very little calories if you order right i love qdoba ending weight lbs phase gain muscle june october months eat a lot i like to eat so this phase was much easier for me i actually probably gained too much weight too quickly and i will be changing that in my future bulk phases calories i aimed for about calories per day example daily meals meal lots of eggs protein shake and cereal meal oz chicken sweet potato veggies meal oz beef w noodles meal protein bar pbj sandwich meal oz protein carbs and veggies meal before bed yogurt or cottage cheese macronutrients my goal was about gg protein per day and filled the rest of my calories with carbs and fats weight training because i had so much more energy i added in another day in the gym so i began going days per week i gained a lot of strength during this phase too which i attributed to the amount of calories i was consuming and better formtechnique that i had been developing with the help of my friend challenges people talk about dirty bulks vs clean bulks dirty bulking is obviously easier and much more enjoyable you basically eat everything you see without regard for anything i probably fell somewhere in between dirty and clean i think its good to find a balance because if you do it too dirty youll end up gaining quite a bit of fat like i did cardio none favorite meal donuts for breakfast and burgers for lunch ya not healthy at all i didnt eat this every day ending weight lbs phase cut the weight reveal gains october december months calories basically went back to what i was eating in phase calories per day with a cheat meal every days trying to keep strength i really feel i have my routine and form dialed in right now with my weight training currently im doing a split that is kind of a mixture of a ppl and brosplit i really like it and i feel exhausted after every workout which is good cardio i try to do cardio once per week but honestly i often skip it im really trying to get more consistent because i know that its good for my cardiovascular health but it just hasnt been top priority for me current weight lbs weight left to lose lbs ________ what motivated me honestly my biggest motivation came from wanting to prove myself wrong all my life ive just accepted that i was overweight and that it was pointless to try and do anything about it i ate food for comfort and when i was stressed every time i went to buy clothes i dreaded it because i knew nothing would fit just right i hated looking at myself in pictures and always secretly felt embarrassed i wanted to prove to myself that i could do it and that it doesnt have to be complicated so whats next enjoy life more with my family friends get out and do things that i couldwouldnt do previously i just want to be the best i can for them take my shirt off this summer and feel confident keep losing weight im wanting to diet down to about bodyfat and then start another bulk phase this time doing it more clean after this time ive spent working on my diet and training ive really gotten into bodybuilding and i considering trying to compete in the future i know im still a long ways away and im pretty old to begin competing but i dont care i just want to give myself a new challenge biggest thing i learned failing is ok i had many days where i felt i had failed but i had to keep reminding myself why i was doing what i was doing so the next day i would just start over with a clean plate and get back on track i had to remember that it was a marathon not a sprint failing is ok just get back up the next day and move forward it doesnt have to be complicated or expensive honestly the biggest thing i learned is that getting in shape isnt rocket science no matter what anyone tells you all these instagram fitness coaches supplement businesses and weightloss magic sellers are just trying to make money some of their products might assist but none of them are a replacement for hardwork in the gym determinationcommitment and a balanced diet i didnt follow any special program i just stopped stuffing my face with food all the time and starting going to the gym a few times per week final thought was it difficult yes many days were struggles to go back to the old me would i go back to how i was before no way in hell ________ for those interested here is a simple breakdown of my current weight lifting program i do this daysweek mondaysaturday day chest quads day back hams glutes day shoulders arms edit adding more training details basic workout breakdown this is a basic example of what my average workout looks like some days ill sub in different exercises but this will give you a good starting point workout a workout b workout c flat bench x deadlift x bb military press x incline bench x widegrip pulldown x narrowgrip bench x cable chest fly x seated row x db shoulder press x db chest fly x bb row x tricep cable ext x bb squat x facepulls x overhead tricep ez bar x leg extension x leg curls x preacher curl x calf raises x bb hip thrusts x db curl x abs abs weekly split i basically rotate my workouts like this on a weekly basis note when im in a cutting phase i might take an additional rest day on wednesday too mon tue wed thr fri sat sun a b c a b c rest edit a couple more tips weigh yourself everyday a lot of people say not to do this but im a firm believer in doing it i believe it helps you get more familiar with your body and how it works you see and understand the fluctuations in your weight throughout the week if you only weigh yourself once a week you could be weighing yourself when youre retaining a lot of water or not retaining and you could get discouraged if you are up a pound or after a week of eating well if you weigh yourself daily then you see these fluctuations constantly eg of how my weight would fluctuate i weighed almost every day for the last months take at least photos a week to track your progress i cant emphasize this enough the scale isnt always the best way to track your progress as you can see from my progress pics i weighed almost the same in my before and after phase pics but my body composition was much different if i had only relied on a scale i could have been discouraged by this but i had plenty of pics to look back and see

89tmux,Fitness,2018-04-04 21:21:41,xposted w permission heres pages of notes ive taken from podcastsinterviewsseminars from leading strength and conditioning coaches stan efferding matt wenning and charles poliquin summaries cliffnotes and personal lessons all provided july edit updated guide with now pages total rd edit october update planned upcoming notes currently in the works compilation of seminars on dr mike israetel and notes for combat sports and conditioning reposted link here is my summary to meet rule of rfitness tldrtop ten changes ive personally made from these lessons theres a million bits of info in these notes but heres some ten takeaways i was able to implement over the course of two months carbs carbs are not the enemy but need to be heavily regulated and based on individual performance digestive health and bodyfat ethnic background is a huge factor that being said charles states you need to earn your carbs while stan is more lenient but still recommends you keep them low if youre not an elite athlete if you do choose to eat carbs white rice is the best carb as it doesnt cause inflammation or digestive issues like potatoes and brown rice can sleep the greatest anabolic absolutely necessary the elite performers sleep hours a day including long naps during the day important to muscle growth fat loss and hormone regulation i dim the lights hours before bed do my best to not check my phone tv or any electronic screen to improve sleep quality programming ive split my workouts with hours between muscle groups using a variety of exercises helps overall performance by choosing accessory work that addresses weaknesses exercise rotation and having a big exercise library prevents injury while allowing constant key movements only main heavy days with the other days as options for accessory or cardio food choice grassfed meat research isnt proven yet and doesnt justify the price eat quality cuts of beef bison and wild game otherwise the best diet is the one you stick to just eliminated processed foods and snacks and choose vegetables and fruits that the body will digest easily fodmap bought a sousvide to prepare the costco steak and a rice maker for the white rice on it for two months and am seeing great results personally ive added lots of berries avocadoes baby carrots nuts coconut oil chia seeds to my daily diet i also add kimchi and guacamole to some meals in order to keep the steak from being too routine also drinking oz of oj multiple times a day warmup stretching is apparently a waste of time and cardio before your lift will cause you to be insulin resistant preventing fat loss either do potentiation exercises or follow this advice brain should know the range of motion and weights should get heavier regarding potentiation find where the weakest links are in the main lift then pick a moderately light weight and choose exercises that affect different muscle groups involved in the main lift for example the squat might be upper back a lower back b then hamstrings c doesnt need to be heavy just consistently volume with minimal rest x with no rest a bc repeat times total then rest minutes then youre ready attack the main lift be if your heavy max or speed work matt noticed clients were getting stronger and form was getting better over time matt started off light but now can do xs of lb dumbells on chest warmups work your way up walking not just for old people ten minute walk after you eat a meal improves digestion decreases doms helps with insulin sensitivity blood is the life force brings in all the nutrients brisk walks with elevated heart outperforms leisure k stepwalks in fat heart cardio benefits recommended is tenminute walks a day can replace all steadystate cardio with walks and hiit recommended them to the women in competition and strongmen like the mountain both of whom saw fantastic results cardio implemented rucks over distance running along with adding swimming cycling and farmers carries long slowdistance work inhibits muscle growth and fatloss that said some cardio is required hence the hiit farmers walks etc as they are recommended still learning to program into the workout regimen build the backside if the muscle is behind you chances are you need to build it stronger the average person will have weak lower and upper back hamstrings glutes calves traps rear delts etc build those up by making them a priority in your accessory exercise selection for example upperback not strong enough will change scapular position on bench press salt upped the intake of my salt iodized salt stimulates thyroid immune system stimulates the liver when you hit a wall its because youre low on sodium not carbs guaranteed single biggest thing you can do to impact performance

2zh7ah,Fitness,2015-03-18 15:48:19,chest an anatomical guide to training you can find my previous posts right here biceps an anatomical guide to training triceps an anatomical guide to training deltoids an anatomical guide to training back an anatomical guide to training anatomy the chest can be split into two parts the pectoralis major and minor pec major originatesstarts on the claviclecollar bone and the sternum insertsattaches on the humerusupper arm pec minor originates on ribs inserts on scapula function pec major flexes the arm at the shoulder medically rotates the arm at the shoulder adducts the arm at the shoulder pec minor pulls your scapula forwards and downwards training tips there are two camps when it comes to chest training one that claims that you cant focus on specific parts of your chest eg upper chest lower chest etc while the other claims that you can i am split between the two you cant completely isolate the upper chest when you do an incline bench press your entire chest will be activated but i believe that to build muscle you have to consciously contract the muscle that you are working known as the mindmuscle connection pumping out a bunch of reps on incline bench press might not target your upper chest the way you want it to but if you perform the incline bench press in a controlled manner and focus on really contractingsqueezing the top of your chest you will see a difference a trick that you can use to learn how to squeeze the muscle is to close your eyes during the set and visualize exactly what you want your chest to do intent is needed to optimally stimulate growth barbells or dumbbells both barbells and dumbbells have their pros and cons in general i have found that barbells are superior for developing overall strength in your pressing and dumbbells are superior for stimulating growth in your chest the reason why i prefer dumbbells for growth is because they allow you to go through a greater range of motion than barbells with dumbbells you can have your arms wide at the bottom of the movement to fully stretch your chest and then have your hand close together at the top to fully contract your chest with a barbell you hands are in a fixed location during the entire movement its much easier to consciously contract the muscle youre intending to work with dumbbells and they have actually been shown to reduce triceps involvement when compared to barbell pressing movements a great trick you can use to make dumbbell movements even more effective for your chest is to pronate your arms the reason why i do this relates back to the anatomy of the pec major the pec major attaches on the humerus and plays a role in medial rotation of the arm pronating your arm is a great cue to initiate medial rotation of the upper arm this allows the chest to be maximally contracted this can be seen here notice at the bottom of the lift the hands move in a supinating motion and then at the top the hands pronate this allows you to stretch your pecs at the bottom of the movement and then fully contract at the top barbells are great for developing overall strength in your pressing muscles when using a barbell you are can lift more weight and you are stimulating your triceps and deltoids to a high level rather than just your chest both of these factors lead to an increase in strength a good chest routine for aestheticbodybuilding purposes will include both barbell and dumbbell work i would recommend movements for your chest while including incline flat and decline work upper chest training the upper chest is usually the part of the chest that most people are lacking the easiest way to target this part of the chest is to train on an incline now keep in mind that the larger the angle of the incline the more the deltoids will be brought into the movement i find that the angle that allows to me to hit my upper chest in the best way is around degrees once i start getting higher than that i feel fatigue in my deltoids before i feel it in my chest incline dumbbell bench press inline barbell bench press incline dumbbellcable flys incline dumbbell press is one of my favourite chest exercises dumbbells really allow you to work through the full range of motion and let you squeeze your chest at the top of each movement a mistake that many people make while performing this exercise is hitting the dumbbells together at the top this usually suggests that youre not maintaining control over the weight during the entire movement instead it is best to stop with about an inch between the dumbbells this allows for a good contraction while maintaining control of the movement incline barbell bench press is also a great movement but i am not too fond of it personally i find that it places a lot of stress on my shouldersrotator cuff many coaches suggest that it is not necessary to touch the bar to your chest for this exercise it is best to stop about an inch or two above your chest because going lower can place unnecessary stress on your rotator cuff flys are a great exercise the same trick described under the dumbbell or barbell section with dumbbells can be applied to flys whether they are on an incline decline flat bench or a machine this can be seen here middle chest training this part of the chest is often associated with flat presses but remember to grow the middle of your chest you cant just perform flat presses without thinking focus on squeezing the middle of your chest while you press flat dumbbell bench press flat barbell bench press flat dumbbellcable flys push ups chest dips flat barbell bench press is a great exercise for chest development and allows you to use heavier weights than you would with a dumbbell but unlike the incline barbell bench press you should touch your chest while you perform this movement with proper form going to your chest will not place too much stress on your shoulders a common technique used by some lifters is bench pressing with a wide grip and flaring their elbows out although this may be effective for chest development i do not think that the risk it places your shoulders at is worth it this puts your shoulders at a very high risk of injury especially with heavier weights instead i would recommend someone to bench press with their elbows slightly tucked in like in the bottom of this image make sure you dont tuck your elbows too far in like in this image for the flat dumbbell bench press and flys the same tips from upper chest apply pushups are great exercise for your chest no matter what your experience is for advanced lifters they could be a great way to finish of your chest workout or can go great in a super set with a lift such as flys for a beginner they are a great way to progress on to the bench press and develop pressing strength before moving on to weights lower chest training the lower chest is often the most neglected part of ones chest decline dumbbell bench press decline barbell bench press decline dumbbellcable flys dorian yates has stated that he believes that the decline barbell bench press is the greatest chest movement for overall chest development some studies have even shown that the decline bench press causes the most activation in the chest when compared to other exercise the decline bench press also places significantly less stress on your shoulders than the flat press would and especially the incline bench press the more of an incline you are at the more shoulder involvement the more of a decline you are at the less shoulder involvement given all of this i personally do not like the decline bench press because it feels awkward to me but if you dont mind it i would recommend for this to be a part of your routine tldr there is a dispute over whether you can isolate parts of the chest or not you cant work only the upper chest for example but using an incline and consciously focusing on contracting the upper chest will really benefit you dumbbells are great for muscle growth and barbells for strength development incorporate both for an optimal routine a cool trick with dumbbells or cables you can use is to pronate your hands at the top of the movement
2rwy05,Fitness,2015-01-10 00:20:08,double transformation severely obese lb to fit lbs and then following a month long coma lbs to lbs i have experienced both extremes ill give a brief tldr here lost lots of weight looked decent went into a long coma and looked like a skeleton then put lots of weight back on over this year height cm lbish to lbs march to today months lbs to lbs basically in i was extremely fat over lbs and life sucked i made big changes over the next two to three years which were spurred mainly by rugby and weightlifting and as you all know learning to control my diet i lost over lbs and gained a bit of muscle over a year period but most of the progress was made in the final year between the ages of here are the results from the initial weightloss unfortunately near the end of after finally reclaiming my body i fell severely ill with pneumonia on christmas day i was rushed to hospital after a large hole formed in my right lung i was hopped onto morphine for two days of which i remember nothing i was put in an induced coma and was in intensive care for days ish of which were in the coma this time last year my mother was planning my funeral it was very touch and go due to organ failure while on life support when i woke from the coma i was too weak to move my legs or raise my arms for three months i didnt eat or drink for two months i couldnt talk due to having a tracheostomy with breathing support it was hell incarnate a true experience of suffering and pain i was incredibly angry throughout the experience why the fuck did this happen why do i have to lose everything one resounding thing which was constantly on my mind throughout was im going to murder the gym when i get out i had to gradually start walking again getting motor skills back etc when i got out of hospital simple things like putting on shoes and walking to the fridge exhausted me i bought a kg weight and starting doing curls but could only manage a few reps i went to physical rehab regularly but i bailed out halfway through and started my gym membership again i did a four day split focusing on compound movements and ate at a kcal surplus i packed on strength and size and put on kg over the course of this year over the last two months i have cut kg in order to lean down for summer achieving this with a simple kcal deficit my results are not perfect i had a lot of issues this year i shattered my hand at the peak of my bulk due to poor bone density following the coma i didnt take time off the gym i just got a strap to clip my cast to the cable machine and did a modified full body workout i do not advocate this for anyone else but i was willing to risk it i also had really bad knee pain from the months of bedrest which has made it very difficult to squat and do any running or walking based cardio i cant compare stats from hospital as i couldnt move my arms so im assuming i was a lightweight here are my stats now squat kg rm deadlift kg rm bench reps of i have never tested max strict press kg rm im not sure if ive provided enough detail so feel free to ask questions i also apologize in advance for any formatting issues this is my first post my message to you all before the coma i was extremely fit my lungs and body were strong i had weight to waste away if i had still been obese with a shitty diet i would be dead if i hadnt taken cardio so seriously i would be dead if my body hadnt been strong i would be dead the doctors said it was a miracle i survived and if it really was that close all those factors related to fitness would definitely have pushed me over that threshold which made me survive the gym is some serious shit man
8grr3j,Fitness,2018-05-03 16:39:52,how at i finally cut to abs and became a pirate original after years of hard work this is my latest cut picture and the first one i am really proud of first heres the progress picture at im older than most here im going to outline some things ive learned in the hope that it will help others i have three big takeaways that i want to lay out this progression shows what is possible when starting out as a skinnyfat desk worker in your late s i have never had a muscular physique nor excelled in sports to any degree over the past few years exercising years ive gotten much stronger and i have bulked and cut many many times but whenever i cut i was disappointed with the results i simply became skinny with little definition but this last cut was different for a few reasons i switched to a body building routine i paid extra attention to to abs and obliques i counted protein religiously i took the plunge and cut an extra lbs lower than i normally do even though this put me at seemingly low overall weight i got a surprising result dexa showed i was able to gain lbs of lean to my lower trunk despite being on a drastic cut i believe this was possible due to noob gains this is odd since i have been powerlifting for many years but only during my cut did i concentrate hard on exercises exclusively hitting abs and obliques my theory is that you can experience noob gains in specific areas that are underdeveloped while cutting quick background ive always been really skinny i was lbs in high school working out daily and playing football didnt change that my buddies all packed on muscle but i stayed superthin after high school i packed on weight but it was all fat at i was lbs very skinny fat i had bad wrists and a bad back i was probably well over bf judging by future dexa scans but i still looked pretty thin in clothes i had a potbelly years ago i discovered keto on reddit and gave it a shot i lost a ton of weight going down to about lbs this was the first time i felt in control of my body i lost lots of fat but now i was really skinny and weak i then started to exercise slowly learning along the way i started with exercise bands and a simple workout i was so weak i eventually got into power lifting and olympic lifting i wasnt great at it but i kept getting stronger lifting scores my lifting scores were really at the bottom starting lifting scores dl lbs squat lbs bench lbs over the next few years i found routines hit the gym days a week and made progress i cycled my bulks and cuts i made mistakes along the way current lifting scores dl lbs yay squat lbs meh bench lbs boo dead lifting comes easy to me which is great considering i used to have chronically bad wrists and lower back thats all gone now and i feel fantastic note i have relatively long arms that probably helps my deadlift and hurts my bench main mistakes over the years past i bulked too fast causing me to have to cut too much i chased the immediate power lifting scores at the expense of packing on fat one time i bulked added lbs per week i now aim for lbs per week i didnt count protein once i did i realized i was deficient i eat fine i dont need to count macros i dont want to live like a lab rabbit i was wrong you should count macros at least once this will give you a good audit of your diet youll be forced to make adjustments going forward youll have a better intuitive idea of your macros and better habits i didnt stick to rigorous programs at first my worst progress was when i just went to the gym and worked out really hard my best progress was when i decided on a program and stuck to it for many months this last cut i was invited to a fun pirate party for a friends th birthday i challenged myself to go semibare chested and show off a great physique i knew of the event months in advance so i planned accordingly so far every time i very time i cut i just looked thin with no definition i had dexas previously and doing the math i calculated that i needed to cut to nearly lbs i never had the nerve to cut so low as it sounded ridiculous but considering that i was lbs in high school maybe it makes some sense i was very nervous of the outcome results no one was more shocked than me at the results several friends asked if i was wearing some sort of fake muscle shirt after the photo and party i stopped cutting i shot up nearly lbs overnight the abs remain but they are much less defined now the dexa showing was taken days after the party this is what i looked like a few weeks later at lbs stats weightlbs lbs lbs lost age years old bf at final i used three methods dexa days after picture calipers point jackson pollock impedance scale dexa scan results my cut was pretty drastic i was worried that id lose muscle i took a before dexa it was many months before i started the cut but its a pretty good comparison previous dexa to final picture was lean lbs gained fat lbs lost diet dexa scan says my rmr is my calday started at and tapered down to cal day towards the end looking at my daily log week cal per day week cal per day week cal per day week cal per day week cal per day but if im honest i was not hitting that and averaging cal per day this is pretty extreme so i started cutting out calories a day over a week to ease into it breakfast coffee with tbsp heavy cream lunch low cal fish talapia mahi mahi no oil oz brussle sprouts snackid usually eat my snack right before hitting the gym protein bar or shake epic chicken bar has g protein and cals alternates pork rinds sardines in water on lettuce bone broth greek yogurt eggs dinner oz new york steak alternates chicken turkey shrimp veggies alcohol no way jose no cheating this time exercise routine before this cut i have never done a bodybuilding routine i have only done power lifting routines with accessories previous routine was nsuns amrap i also ran ben pollacks unf your program the nsuns had the biggest impact bringing my combined power lifting score from lbs to lbs during the cut i did scott hermans bodybuilding split which is basically monday chest dumbell cable flys etc tuesday backbiceps obliques pull downs curls etc wednesday glutesquadstraps squat etc thursday hamstrings shoulders dead lift lat raises etc friday abs and obliques saturday rest sunday start over cardio moderate minutes stairmaster after a workout some light jogging for minutes at a time a note on abs and obliques my obliques got huge dexa literally says that i gained lbs of the total lbs in my lower trunk area abs and obliques i am positive that all of this happened during the cut and not before a few thoughts i think i was severely under trained in my obliques thus i was able to experience the magical noobgains in that area while my other more trained areas stayed about the same compound lifts alone did not work my abs and obliques enough i needed target exercises such as wood choppers side bends they key seems to be to do these slow controlled with solid form and really feel the obliques mentally isolate the oblique and try to only use that muscle for the exercise i hope that this encourages some older folks or skinnyfat folks to hang in there and stay the course and remember kids count your protein edit my lifting scores i have not been lifting for four years four years ago i started to diet and get more healthy the first few years of my fouryear journey consisted of light exercises learning how to exercise i didnt even know what a squat or deadlift was years ago i started my first serious strength program nsuns amrap months ago i added lbs to my combined score within months as stated in the mistakes section i wasted time by not following a rigorous program being a strongman powerlifter is not my goal i am not offering powerlifting advice or claiming to be good at it framesize im really smallframed so please keep that in mind before applying anything i did to you my dad and brother are and naturally hover at lbs they have big hands and thick wrists my dad once dieting down to lbs and he was thin my brother told me that even if he doesnt workout for a few years he can walk into the gym rep lb on the bench with ease my wrists are i think thats considered small even for a woman i wear a size small shirt have a waste small wrists small ankles narrow feet i naturally hover at about lbs my dexa shows my rmr at only calday most guys are naturally much larger and need more calories i do not recommend my daily calday for others also this was a temporary cut over weeks for a specific date this is not a lifestyle this is an experiment bonus photos in celebration of hitting k upvotes heres a bonus pirate photo arg thats a professional johny depp impersonator he pulled it off really well by getting extremely drunk and staggering about slurring his words
3z8bkm,Fitness,2016-01-03 03:58:19,my year journey of becoming fit healthy and happy f lbs lbs hi rfitness this is just my personal success story many times along the way i came into this sub along with rloseit and rprogresspics for inspiration and motivation and i believe it helped me get through some of the harder days when i just wanted to give up i still remember the day i was watching my son in swimming lessons looking at the gym in the same building and wondering if i could do it i have been overweight most of my life and never thought i could really lose the weight it was april and i made a goal for myself the next day i was going to be lbs by the time i started nursing school in september i downloaded myfitnesspal and started counting calories i worked hours a day in a highly physical job but made myself go to the gym every night after work for at least an hour i had one training session where they taught me to do a half hour of weights and a half hour of cardio i stuck to this routine religiously and the weight just fell off it was the middle of august when i got on the scale and it read lbs i cried so hard that day i had hit the goal i set for myself and was more confident than ever i will never forget that day fitness has turned into a passion for me now its part of my life it got me through nursing school and many hard times in my life many days after a long day at the hospital i come to the gym to unwind and rejuvenate the gym is my escape i head to the gym when i am happy sad or just bored i cant picture my life without it now i have gained great friends immense knowledge and an appreciation for this body i live in that i never had before i have never stopped setting goals when i hit one pr i start working on the next i believe that is the key to my success constant goal setting and a thorough determination to be better than i was the day before now the good part pictures before after today thanks for reading edit diet is the most important key to my success i believe when i started i kept my calories around day i exercised using weight machines and mostly elliptical for an hour a day at least days a week as the weight started coming off i continued to count calories but changed my routine to a more endurance based program with lower weights and higher reps i then went to a x strength gaining program and started incorporating squats deadlifts etc thats where i really found my love i have a true love for heavy lifting i basically have done a combination of all of those things for the last couple years i change it up every couple of months to keep things interesting and make further progress now i am counting macros it is the best thing i have done by far it started as a challenge with a girlfriend to eat g carbsg fatsg protein each day for days i also added a lot of cardio with weights type exercises and hiit training to my regime it worked wonders i continued past the days and lost a total of lbs in days it toned me up fantastically as well the first days of eating by those macros just about killed me but i am so happy i did it and i continue to eat close to those macros today i want to maintain the body i have now and maybe tone up a bit more edit thank you all for the lovely kind words i am absolutely overwhelmed by the response thank you all so much i hope i can inspire even just one person to believe in themselves and do what has always seemed to just be a dream i wanted to answer some questions this morning but i came online to find the post locked and i am unable to comment directly to people so ill answer a bit here yes i squat i max out for squats at bench at and i can pull a deadlift i am super proud of those numbers i absolutely have issues with excess skin and stretch marks it is getting better everyday and i credit the weightlifting for that i did lose the weight suddenly at first but the gradual toning up thanks to weight lifting over the last few years has helped to make the skin a little less saggy i still have quite a bit of extra skin in the thigh area maybe one day it will look better than today but i have gotten used to it

av1m8l,Fitness,2019-02-26 16:53:35,more than you ever wanted to know about creatine creatine is one of the most widelyused supplements and for good reason its cheap and it has more research supporting its efficacy than any other supplement out there except perhaps for protein supplements if you dont get enough protein from your diet however creatine does a lot of other interesting stuff beyond just helping you train a little harder and build more muscle and strength since there are a lot of questions about creatine on rfitness i thought this article would be of interest for a lot of folks not another boring creatine guide answers to faqs and lesserknown benefits heres the short version basic stuff creatine primarily works via allowing you to train harder since it increases the supply of readily available energy for highintensity contractions however it also has direct effects on signaling pathways that contribute to growth so far plain old creatine monohydrate seems to work as well as other fancier and more expensive forms of creatine assuming you plan on taking creatine longterm theres not much reason to do a highdose creatine loading phase your muscles will attain full saturation in weeks anyways more interesting stuff some people are creatine nonresponders meaning that creatine supplementation doesnt increase muscle creatine levels however these people tend to be the folks who had higher creatine levels prior to supplementation anyways so theyre not really missing out on anything creatine supplementation can actually improve bone health creatine can improve brain health and mental performance especially when youre tired or stressed most of the benefits of creatine especially the mental and cognitive benefits seem to be larger in vegetarians and vegans than omnivores since theyre not getting nearly as much creatine from their diet creatine doesnt cause dehydration in fact it may actually decrease incidences of heat illness and cramping when exercising in the heat suggesting it may improve hydration status creatine may make asthma symptoms worse though that effect seems to be ameliorated by aerobic exercise the infamous study which found that creatine increased dht levels a hormone associated with hair loss has probably been blown out of proportion the effects of creatine may be blunted by taking it with high doses of caffeine if thats something youre worried about just taking creatine and caffeine at different times ie caffeine preworkout and creatine postworkout should negate that interaction thats the very abbreviated version the whole article is probably a minute read full disclosure the article is published on my website however i did not write it the author eric trexler has his phd in exercise physiology and most of his research is in sports nutrition and supplementation including research on creatine so im clearly biased about this article but the author is an actual expert on the topic if youre interested in getting into the nitty gritty details id strongly recommend reading the full article since it goes into a lot more depth than my tldr not another boring creatine guide answers to faqs and lesserknown benefits

8ldda9,Fitness,2018-05-22 20:34:32,years progress of consistent lifting and controlling what i eat iifym and if when cutting m starting weight lbs current weight lbs around years ago my now wife and i went on a trip to costa rica with her family for the christmas holiday break when i got back and looked at pictures of myself it really hit me that i was no longer that guy who could eat whatever he wanted and not gain any weight in my teens and early twenties i was pretty active played sports and never had to pay much attention to what i ate somewhere along the lines i stopped being as active and everything started catching up with me i started hitting the gym that week and havent stopped since i initially dropped from to in about months so about a pound per week more in the beginning less towards the end i did iifym and if and tried to eat about clean and treats i lifted in the past for sports so i knew my way around weights enough to get by i started out with some random routine i found online that was some sort of reverse pyramid training days a week but i honestly cant remember exactly what it was after my initial cut i had kind of a fail on my first bulk and put on too much fat and not enough muscle i cut down again and ended up around with slightly higher body fat so i didnt really add much mass finally did my first successful bulkcut this past year starting last june i just finished up cutting down for the summer from my bulked weight of to and am probably at the lowest body fat ive ever been im guessing ill end up around when i start eating more again and upping my carb intake for both the bulk and cut i did a ppl routine days a week and dropped volume as needed during my cut i stuck with iifym throughout and did if when cutting i also added some cardio towards the end of my cut either walking up hill or jump rope overall ive learned a lot these past couple years and have really enjoyed lifting and bodybuilding as a new hobby looking forward to starting my next bulk soon feel free to ask any questions id be happy to provide more info for those that are interested pictures from top to bottom before and after start lbs after first cut lbs after first bulkcut kind of a fail lbs after recent bulk lbs after recent cut lbs collage of them all in one picture more detailed info diet i use mfp to track everything that i eat i try to eat clean of the time and then treat myself of the time with sweets or really fatty foods i do about glb body weight for protein glb body weight fat and the rest carbs i eat anywhere from calories depending on if i am bulking or cutting and my tdee is somewhere around i eat a lot of chicken but am not a fan of just baked chicken rice and veggies i try to mix it up and make different things but here are some gotos chicken tacos chicken stir fry use riced cauliflower instead of rice when cutting pizza on cauliflower crust trader joes has a good one but its on the higher end for carbs pasta use spaghetti squash when cutting chicken chili some prepackaged pastas indian food etc from trader joes lunch meat wraps on lavash low cal for a large wrap with a lot of fiber protein shakes i like to try new things and my wife and i will often try different recipes and modify ingredients to make them healthier it helps me keep on my diet to have some go to things where i know all the macros but also try new things to keep from getting bored however i do eat pretty much the same turkey wrap for lunch every day im typically too busy during the day to care what i eat and it fits in with my macros well most of the time when im bulking i also add in things like bagels and cereal for extra carbs i also have a protein shake almost every day a sample cutting meal would be am post workout protein shake pm lunch turkey wrap on lavash with chips the baked jalapeno chips and sometimes another shake pm dinner chicken tacos with mexican rice and veggies for dinner bulking is similar but i add a bagel with cream cheese for breakfast milk and sometimes fruit or peanut butter added to protein shake more carbs with dinner so have more rice with tacos for instance a bowl of cereal with milk before bed lifting i honestly dont remember much about my first routine when i initially lost weight and unfortunately i lost the spreadsheet i had on my phone it was a reverse pyramid training program that was split up into a day per week workout more recently i have been doing a ppl routine days per week starting with push on monday i typically rest on sundays but sometimes in the middle of the week if something comes up ive subbed in different lifts at different times and like to play around with new lifts from time to time but here is an example of what i would do on each day push incline or flat bench x shoulder press x chest flyes x lateral raises x tricep extensions x tricep pull downs or dips x pull seated rows x weighted pull ups x single arm rows x face pulls x barbell curls x hammer curls x legs squats or leg press x straight leg deadlifts x leg extensions x leg curls x calf raises x some sort of abs switched up frequently i do different rep ranges from x to x and typically stick to higher weight lower reps for the compound exercises and vice versa for accessories but i switch things up periodically to keep myself engaged some numbers incline bench x havent done flat in a while honestly but probably around x ohp x squat x pullups bw x seated rows x i dont deadlift anymore but sldl x i tore my hamstring a while back so leg numbers didnt progress as well as upper body since i had to stop training them for a while i also add in some cardio like walking on the treadmill at an incline or jumping rope when im near the end of my cut lessons learned if and iifym are great i think intermittent fasting is great for cutting im not sold on all the extra benefits that some claim it gives but it does allow me to eat a giant delicious dinner every night which really helps keep me on my diet i also really enjoy iifym since it allows me to work in foods i really enjoy on a regular basis make sure to get enough micronutrients though as that can be easy to overlook sometimes eat your vegetables and take a multivitamin dont dirty bulk if you really want to go for it but i dont think its worth it i had a great few months on my first bulk just eating whatever i wanted and getting nice and fat but i ended up putting on mostly fat and made barely any progress once i cut down if youre natural i just cant see a reason to do this your body can only put on so much muscle at a time i still like bulkingcutting rather than doing a very slow bulk yearround because i think you get better results and i like switching it up but you have to bulk within reason stick with a program while i do like to tweak things here and there i think its important to stick to a base program for a decent period of time dont waste your time trying to find the new best thing every other month just pick something and stick to it unless youre a very advanced lifter most programs will work for you and youll be more inclined to continue going to the gym if you stick with one routine feel free to make some small modifications if you want to keep things interesting or fit your needs better but dont gut your whole program weekly treatcheat meals are awesome every week i have one meal where i dont track the calories or macros at all although i dont go too crazy and eat an entire pizza and order of breadsticks by myself typically my wife and i will go out to dinner somewhere this really helps keep me on my diet and makes me feel good from both a mental and physical standpoint have a workout buddy if you enjoy working out on your own thats definitely fine but i find it helpful to have someone to lift with my wife and i do a great job of keeping each other on track and doing thing like pushing the other to go to the gym when feeling lazy its nice to have someone else to help motivate you when you may not always have the motivation yourself track your changes take tons of measurements and progress pics its the only way to know for sure how you are progressing and it may seem tedious but youll be thankful for that info when you want to reflect back and see how far youve come if youre a nerd like me put it all in excel and make lots of charts fit in cardio where you can when youre cutting you can fit in random times to do cardio to help with the weightfat loss i used to walk to and from work which came out to around miles of walking a day i didnt realize it but it definitely added up also my wife and i live in the city so we take nightly walks around the neighborhood its about a mile and half of walking and its a nice added bonus of getting to spend extra time together
5w7a4v,Fitness,2017-02-26 00:08:31,built a gym in my garage instead of buying a gym membership heres the pics the only decent gym in my area charges per month and its always packed so i figured id try building a gym for the price of roughly a one year membership heres the rundown standard weights lbs dumbbells ez bar and standard bar on cl olympic weights lbs olympic bar and pair of lb hex dumbbells on cl olympic bar from amazon power rack from amazon bench from amazon floor mats weight stand from play it again sports x mirrors on cl total i went a bit over my budget but i might still end up selling some of those olympic plates i justified the extra i spent by telling myself i can always just sell most of this stuff on cl and still end up with a relatively minimal loss compared to what i originally bought the stuff for for anyone thinking about doing something like this themselves i cant recommend mirrors enough not only do they let you look at your magnificent self while you lift heavy things but theyre terrific at both adding more light to the room and helps you keep your form in check if i had to do it all over again i think the only thing i would do different is buying the heavy duty floor mats instead of the jigsaw ones you can tell theyre cheap and they seem like theyre already breaking down a bit im going to buy at least one to put underneath the olympic bar ive got on the ground there im also probably going to buy a pair of dip handles and something to tag onto the side of the cage to hold the rest of the weights ive got stacked in the corner so i can use that space for stuff like curls and resistance band exercises
4fc8ta,Fitness,2016-04-18 15:00:55,i wrote a guide to help you manage your eating heres the post its not because youre hungry ways to control your eating hey rfitness this is the third and possibly final guide ive written for you guys after the first two on consistently going to the gym and choosing a beginner weight training program i had dozens of requests for a guide on the psychology of eating and sticking to a consistent diet so here it is when most people are asked why they eat the answer is simple hunger we definitely do eat because were hungry but there are a million other factors that can cause us to eat more or less without realizing who were with where we are what time it is what were eating off of and where the food is all have a major impact on our eating habits by understanding the things that make us eat we can adjust our lifestyles to effortlessly eat more or less one thing to note i know rfitness loves counting calories i agree that counting calories is effective and will work but i also think that it can be tedious and overwhelming especially for someone that is simultaneously trying to start an exercise habit changing too much at once can be a recipe for disaster i personally dont count calories i have didnt like it much and the advice in this guide is not geared towards calorie counting that said it will still be helpful to those that do count calories understanding why youre tempted to snack can help you resist or encourage snacking and more easily hit your macros the guide is split into two parts part one covers the common elements of our environment that cause us to over or undereat youll learn why you dont just eat when youre hungry and begin to identify the deeply ingrained food habits that govern your behavior part two tackles the most common eating struggles we face as mindless eaters youll learn how to control portion size how to control snacking how to eat out less and what to do when you eat out in part one well discuss some common elements of our environment that contribute to eating namely social eating timebased eating cleanplate eating dish size accessibility of food in part two i provide ways to manage the major aspects of eating portion size snacking and eating out portion size use smaller dishesutensils keep serving dishes away from the table get a new plate for each serving slow down be mindful sometimes snacking hide your snacks never eat from the bag use a cookie counter swap dont stop understand your snacking eating out meal prep get better at cooking track the cost of eating out portion control youll notice that most of these tips seem geared towards people trying to lose weight in each i also give tips for those trying to gain but the tips are basically the same do the opposite of the tactics you would use to lose weight this is the last megaguide ill post here for quite a while ill still be posting other stuff on my site so i hope you find it useful let me know what you think

a4r12k,Fitness,2018-12-10 01:37:24,review of recent fitnessnutrition studies protein and pushups intermittent fasting omega fatty acids more edit intermittent fasting in the title of this thread should be replaced with intermittent caloric restriction creds to ujiend i wrote a review on some recent fitnessnutrition papers i tried my best to write for the layman but also not oversimplifying anything i originally wrote all of this on an external page which will not be linked here but for those who wish to see it kindly dm me regardless i hope you all learn something and enjoy reading this this is all written for educational purposes so any discussion or comments within this thread are very encouraged also if everything is far too wordy for you i have included tldrs for each section the covered topics the anabolic window intermittent caloric restriction protein supplementation omega fatty acids antioxidants and squat technique chronological order the first paper that we will cover is a short one by schoenfeld aragon in which they reviewed the literature on the anabolic window for protein intake after training shortterm studies had conflicting results but a metaanalysis conducted by schoenfeld aragon krieger actually showed a minor benefit to consuming protein immediately after a training bout in terms of muscle hypertrophy however after more analysis where they controlled for more variables they found that this small benefit was more attributed to overall protein intake this is because some studies did not match for daily protein intake between groups meaning that some groups were having a higher daily protein intake than some other groups which is generally considered to be more important than intake timing this metaanalysis has what we call a heterogeneity in the literature used this simply means that the papers pooled and analyzed together widely differed in methods populations and outcomes so amongst those papers we could see different protein intakes training and untrained individuals and some being matched and not matched for daily protein intake the review highlighted a trial done by schoenfeld aragon wilborn urbina hayward krieger where trained participants exercised times a week for weeks while either being allocated to a group that consumed grams of whey protein immediately before or after a training session hypertrophy was similar between groups but the dietary control in the study was questionable as subjects actually ate at a reported calorie intake that was lower than baseline when they were supposed to be bulking it is still up in the air as to whether there is any real benefit but all in all the authors suggest that if there is any effect it is likely very small they also propose that a meal hours before a workout is likely good enough as the anabolic response to a meal lasts up to hours layman gkg of protein intake pre or post exercise is also advised to be sufficient tldr there may be some advantage to eating protein immediately after a workout but it may be very small more rigorous research needs to be conducted meals hours before training and gkg of protein prepost workout may yield adequate results a randomized control trial studying the effects of intermittent caloric restriction compared to a standard continuous caloric restriction on body composition and other bio markers in men and women was recently published schübel et al split all subjects into groups the first group did continuous caloric restriction where the daily caloric deficit was around the second group followed a pattern for intermittent caloric restriction in which nonconsecutive days of the week consisted of a caloric deficit of the final group was a control group a group with no advice to lose body mass the first weeks of the study intervention phase had the subjects work closely with dietitians to help follow their allocated diet plans this included facetoface sessions as well biweekly phone calls the following weeks maintenance phase had no advice from any dietitians but the participants did receive motivational support in the final weeks followup phase the subjects received no help whatsoever scales and diaries were provided to everyone to help track and follow their diets the primary outcome chosen by the researchers was the expression taking genetic information and turning it into a product of genes that are related to the pathophysiology of obesity other studied variables include body mass index blood pressure waist circumference body fat liver fat diet compliance and quality of life during the intervention phase the intermittent caloric restriction group actually lost more body mass compared to the continuous restriction group but the pvalue was just above significance p this just means that if were to repeat the experiment assuming there is no difference between interventions and that results are obtained purely by chance the chance of seeing a more extreme result is above a level that is considered safe anyways after the weeks the percentage losses were a lot closer vs for intermittent caloric restriction and continuous restriction respectively with no statistical significance for the primary outcomes gene expression there was no difference between subgroups like male vs female or overweight vs obese there were no differences there were no differences in biomarkers or quality of life an interesting finding was that the intermittent caloric restriction group had the worst compliance in the later weeks from participants only were doing energyrestricted days per week at the final week this may be reflected in the fact that the intermittent caloric restriction group had a higher mass regain after week compared to the continuous restriction group despite this there were never any significant differences in any body composition variables at any time point in the study tldr intermittent caloric restriction is a valid method for weight loss but there does not seem to be a metabolic advantage from intermittent caloric restriction over continuous restriction in overweight individuals it may be harder to follow the intermittent caloric restriction diet for an extended period of time the next study was carried out amongst new recruits in the us army while doing their initial entry training iet iet is basically where civilians learn the fundamentals of being a soldier and improve their fitness before moving on to become trained soldiers the programme is known to be quite tough and part of this is due to the documented caloric deficit kcals that most of the recruits suffer from during training mcadam mcginnis ory young frugé roberts sefton mcadam et al sought to see if there was an effect from whey protein supplementation on body composition measures body mass and skin folds as well as fitness test results amongst male recruits the investigation was done in a doubleblinded fashion both the subjects and the researchers did not know who was getting which intervention and the intervention lasted weeks two servings kcal g protein of whey protein were given per day morning and night another group received a carbohydrate placebo that was matched for calories dietary analysis was done through logs completed by subjects in week and on nonconsecutive days both groups maintained about the same body mass and gained similar amounts of lean mass however there was a statistically significant greater fat loss in the whey protein supplemented group with a large effect size kg vs kg an effect size is basically a numerical measure on how strong one variable affects another it is generally categorized into small medium or large effect sizes in terms of fitness the amount of situps done in minutes as well as the mile run timing did not differ between groups despite seeing improvements in both groups for pushups the whey protein group performed more on average in minutes medium effect size despite having regimented meals and meal times dietary control was an issue with this study there was a documented daily kcal intake difference between groups favoring the whey protein group therefore the results may be due to the higher kcal intake rather than the higher protein intake or it may be more of a combination there was also a great difference between all the subjects in terms of training history as evidenced by the extreme variation in lean mass between recruits at baseline training history has an effect on bodily response to protein as well as fitness lastly this study lacks a control group regardless of these problems it is clear that the additional calories ingested by the recruits had a positive effect on their fitness perhaps such a dietary approach can be adopted by the us army in the future tldr the whey protein supplemented group had more body fat loss and higher pushup counts compared to carbohydrate supplemented group consisting of young males this study however contains a few shortcomings in design no kcaltraining history matching a review on omega fatty acid npufa supplementation for sports performance was recently published philpott witward galloway from the work of smith et al we see that npufa supplementation has the potential to increase muscle protein synthesis mps rates in response to protein intake muscle protein synthesis is the addition of muscle proteins to muscle the building blocks of muscle the main acids of discussion are eicosapentaenoic acid epa docosahexaenoic acid dha and αlinolenic acid ala epa and dha is mostly derived from fish oils while ala is more from plantbased oils like soybean oil an invitro experiments done in controlled environments like laboratories instead of in living organisms like humans study by kamolrat gray found that dha has no effect on mps while epa does however these effects on mps may be redundant because optimal protein intake likely saturates any amelioration in mps unfortunately no studies looking at the effects of npufa supplementation of muscle strengthhypertrophy in the young and athletic exist although there is some evidence suggesting muscle strengthhypertrophy and performance benefits in older men and womensmith et al rodacki et al there is theory for npufas to help with synthesizing mitochondria the mitochondria are parts of a cell that have the role of producing energy for our body however only one study examined this relationship and while there was a positive correlation it was conducted in obese subjects laiglesia et al therefore the use of npufas for improving endurance is largely still theoretical especially in the athletic population there is also some theory in npufas having a positive effect on insulin sensitivity but it is mostly not understood in a rodent study increased expression of glut protein which transports glucose to muscle lowering blood glucose was seen with npufa supplementation but any of this has yet to be seen in human experiments lanza et al kawabata neya hamazaki watanabe kobayashi tsuji found reduced oxygen consumption with npufa supplementation in untrained young males this may be linked to insulin sensitivity theory as increased insulin sensitivity leads to more glycogen in muscles which would displace fat use for energy and less oxygen consumption as a result this effect may not have such a considerable effect in sporting performance as hingley macartney brown mclennan peoples found no improvement in time trial times strength or average power with npufa use despite an observed reduction in oxygen consumption npufas have antiinflammatory properties so it has been proposed that they can support the recovery process after sportexercise however the literature shows equivocal results finally there is interesting discussion as to whether or not npufas can aid in the recovery from a concussion as substantial amounts of dha can be found in the brain wang et al showed that rats had better cognitive performance with npufas compared with rats that had soybean oil the closest human evidence to all this theory was obtained by oliver et al in which less concentrations of a biomarker for head trauma was seen in american football players who ingested npufas tldr omega fatty acids have potential to improve muscle strengthhypertrophy endurance recovery and concussion recovery but much more evidence is needed before any recommendations can be made dutra alex mota sales brown bottaro ran a randomized control study to evaluate the relationship between antioxidants and muscle strength hypertrophy and fatigue young women participated in the study and they were separated into groups the first group ingested mg of vitamin c and iu of vitamin e daily the second group received a placebo and the last group was the control everyone followed a periodized training programme consisting of upper body and lower body exercises times per week for weeks there were no reported differences in lower body muscle thickness fatigue or strength furthermore only the placebo group showed an improvement over control in peak torque and total work done this indicates that antioxidant supplementation has a negative effect on muscular performance it is unknown as to why the researchers did not assess the same variables in the upper body the use of a dynamometer as a measure of strength limits applicability to training as more specific measurements like rm bench press or squat would give more realistic results finally there was little to no dietary control within this study tldr antioxidant use was detrimental to muscular performance amongst young women comfort mcmahon suchomel undertook a review in search of the optimum squat technique they defined optimum technique as having the least injury risk most muscle activation and most carryover to athletic performance in regards to safety they noted that squats are generally safer for the knee ligaments when compared to other leg exercises like leg extensions however the strain on the posterior collateral ligament increases with squat depth zheng fleisig escamilla barrentine anterior cruciate ligament acl strain can also be minimized by keeping the heels on the ground likely due to less tibial displacement your shinbone moving around with the heels on the ground toutoungi lu leardini catani oconnor some people suggest to keep the knees behind the toes in the squat especially if you want to preserve knee joint health while this does decrease the knee joint forces by it increases the hip joint forces by over and it may have negative effects on the lumbar spine due to a more forward trunk lean fry a c smith j c schilling b k one final point to make on injury risks is that using lighter loads for greater depth will not necessarily decrease the joint stress at the knee because the knee still has to withstand more force from the higher knee flexion angles as a result of increased squat depth as for squat depth deep squats are better than and squats for strength and performances like jumping weiss andrew wood relyea melton hartmann wirth klusemann dalic matuschek schmidtbleicher part of these results were in conflict with a study done by rhea et al where sprints and jump performances were improved best in the squat depth group when compared to those who did depth or full depth squats bazyler sato wassinger lamont stone discovered that the addition of partial range of motion squats to fulldepth squats over weeks led to greater repmaximums against those who did only fulldepth squats in trained men however this may simply just have to do with the increased volume as well as increased training intensity for those who did partial squats digressing to muscle activation smith machine squats have been shown to decrease activation in a couple of the quadriceps muscles schwanbeck chilibeck binsted before continuing it is important to discuss the relation of electromyography emg recording electrical activity from muscles to muscle strengthhypertrophy correlation with strength has been documented by hof the correlation with hypertrophy is not perfect but it is strongly correlated with functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri for measuring muscle activation and fmri can adequately forecast muscle hypertrophy dickx dhooge cagnie deschepper verstraete danneels wakahara fukutani kawakami yanai in an emg study run by caterisano et al the full squat was found to have had better activation in the glutes compared to parallel or partial squats a more recent emg experiment from bryanton kennedy carey chiu discovered greater emg responses in the knee extensors quadriceps with deeper squats but not in response to heavier loads the glutes however responded more to heavier loads and deeper squats as well this suggests the quadriceps can be isolated in a sense with low load deep squats foot rotation has only been reported to have an effect on hip abductor activation the smaller glute muscles that sit under the gluteus maximus with external rotation feet turned out and this rotation may allow for greater depths to be achieved pereira leporace chagas furtado praxedes batista lastly an increased stance width beyond shoulder width results in more glute and adductor longus thigh muscle under the quads moves leg towards body along the lateral plane activation in the end the authors recommend a squat with a natural stance width foot rotation heels on the floor full depth degrees of knee flexion neutral spine and free movement of the knees allowed to go over toes tldr squats are fine for knee ligaments heels on floor less acl strain knees behind toes cause more hip joint stress deep squats generally better smith machine may have less activation

aorzzi,Fitness,2019-02-09 12:39:11,review of recent fitness studies iv caffeine tolerance is too much sleep harmful how much protein per meal hey guys its been awhile hope you are all having a wonderful chinese new year for those who celebrate as usual ive collected a few interesting studies and wrote short summaries of them for all of you to read all for educational purposes and to spark some discussion the paper on sleep is not entirely related to fitness but it is healthrelated and i thought it would be interesting nonetheless the first study we will look at is a review written by schoenfeld aragon and it asks the question how much protein can muscles use for growth in one meal this is actually a common question thrown around in the fitness world as a lot of people want to be as efficient as possible and want to maximize proteins effects on muscle growth in each meal however as odd as it sounds sometimes the question is asked incorrectly for the question above some people will ask how much protein can be absorbed in one meal as opposed to how much can be used for muscle growth maximally all protein will be absorbed but the real question is what happens to all of it afterwards the review highlights the study conducted by areta et al which is commonly cited to say that grams of protein is the maximum number that muscles can use for hypertrophy muscular growth in this study trained individuals were given different amounts of protein in a hour period postworkout some were supplemented with grams every hours some grams every hours and some grams every hours in this experiment the group that consumed grams had the greatest rates of muscle protein synthesis a fancy term to describe the building of muscles with protein this would suggest that eating around grams of protein at a time would be the best for building muscle the biggest limitation that this review noted in the aforementioned study was that the total protein amounts used over the hour period were quite low practically individuals training for hypertrophy would be consuming much greater amounts of protein overall to challenge the previous study the review presents a paper done by macnaughton et al in which grams of protein elicited greater muscle protein synthesis than grams in the context of full body training another experiment carried out by kim et al found that g of beef protein showed a more significant anabolic response than g of beef protein however it should be noted that this response was measured as a whole body response and not just for muscle protein synthesis therefore it is impossible to say which amount is better for muscle protein synthesis in the context of this study for women arnal et al found that one meal with a large amount of protein was better than the same amount spread across several meals in regards to muscle retention these results are interesting but a limitation to extrapolation is that no resistance training was taking place amongst the subjects muscle retention is also similar between those who follow intermittent fasting and those who diet continuously seimon et al this would suggest that daily protein taken all at once would have the same effects on muscle as spreading out your protein intake across the day in the end the authors of this review recommend gkgmeal which follows daily recommended intakes stated in a metaanalysis produced by morton et al tldr it still is not clear what the optimum number of grams of protein per meal for maximizing muscular growth is but gkgmeal appears to be a safe recommendation based on the current literature we will now eat into a study done by lee et al in which differences between the conventional deadlift and the romanian deadlift were investigated for those who do not know what a romanian deadlift is it is essentially a normal deadlift starting from the top barbell at waist and then descending the barbell down until the hamstrings cannot stretch any further while not flexing at the lumbar spine the knees cannot bend further than roughly degrees it may sound like a stifflegged deadlift however in a stiff legged deadlift you generally start from the bottom and your knees are allowed to bend more allowing you to bring the barbell to the floor if you are referring to the straightlegged deadlift the knees would not flex at all and the barbell would not drag along the legs in the descent the study recruited males with at least years of both conventional and romanian deadlift experience with their training occurring at least twice a week the first day involved repetition maximum testing as this would facilitate selecting the appropriate load for the participants during the trial subjects would be doing reps of each lift at of their repetition maximum to examine muscle activation the scientists used electromyography to put it simply this is where electrodes are pasted over certain muscles to measure the electrical activity from the muscles the conventional deadlift showed more activation in the rectus femoris a quadricep muscle one that helps extend your knee and flex your hip and slightly more activation in the gluteus maximus your butt activation of the biceps femoris a hamstring muscle was similar between the two lifts which is interesting considering that many believe that the romanian deadlift helps target the hamstrings better compared to the conventional deadlift torque force produced about a joint was much higher in the knee for the conventional deadlift which was probably expected considering the knee goes through a much larger range of motion similarly the torque measured at the ankles were also higher in the conventional deadlifts which may suggest higher calf muscle activity though this was not measured in the study some important design aspects to note that affect generalizability is that we may see different results with different loadsintensities another issue regarding intensity is that the loads were selected according to the repetition maximum of the subjects romanian deadlift therefore the conventional deadlift loads may not truly be of their conventional deadlift repetition maximum it is safe to say that the intensities in this study were likely not matched finally the hamstrings consist of several muscles but only one hamstring muscle was observed during the experiment tldr the conventional deadlift may be better at targetting the quadriceps and the gluteal muscles against what is commonly thought the romanian deadlift may not be better than the conventional deadlift at hitting the hamstrings however more comprehensive electromyography analysis should be done before making a solid statement edit as pointed out by ubleearch the romanian deadlift may be beneficial for those who have knee problems as you get to enjoy the same hamstring activation while going through less knee torque a large study conducted by wild et al explored the effects of duration of sleep on cognition the team created a questionnaire which tested various human cognitive aspects like shortterm memory reasoning spatial working and planning however the main areas that were being observed were short term memory reasoning and verbal ability at the same time questions about sleep were asked to see the relationship between the persons sleep and their cognitive ability the questionnaire was set up as an online survey in which they were able to gather subjects firstly it appears that as a person ages their sleep duration decreases all areas of cognition were affected by sleep duration except for short term memory this is likely because short term memory is a loworder cognitive process it is not as complex as something like problem solving looking at the graphs below we can clearly see an invertedu for almost all cognitive areas which tells us that both too little and too much sleep has negative effects on cognition even when the authors thinned the analyzed subjects by removing extremes from both ends of the results they still saw the invertedu the most optimal sleep duration for overall cognitive ability according to these results is hours any duration over hours likely has a negative effect on cognition and the authors were able to reliably find negative effects below hours of sleep it was also highlighted that even a single night of sleep had effects on cognition the next day people who are chronically poor sleepers can benefit from just a single night of good quality sleep and the same viceversa good sleepers are affected by one bad night sleeping less than usual or sleeping hours more than usual on one night showed negative effects for cognition on average despite sleep duration decreasing with age the results showed that age has no effect on the relationship between sleep duration and cognitive ability an interesting fact illustrated by this study is that if one were to sleep less than four hours in a night you would experience a cognitive impairment that is the same as adding years to your age cognitive ability worsens with age clear limitations of this study include the crosssectional nature of the study we are only looking at a snapshot of these peoples lives long term effects of sleep duration are not seen the lack of people over years old as well as children adolescents and the fact that all these results were selfreported regarding the last point the authors explain that the selfreporting still has moderate correlation with objective data tldr getting hours of sleep appears to be optimal for cognition sleeping any less or more shows some cognitive deficit even a one nights sleep can show acute effects on cognition the next study is a new metaanalysis done by grgic et al seeing whether or not the time of the day you do your training has an effect on muscle growth or strength a meta analysis is where you pool the results of several studies together and is generally seen as the greatest form of scientific evidence previous research appears to be equivocal in regards to the effects of training time and muscle strengthgrowth with some studies showing a more positive effect in evening training and some presenting no difference at all between times in total the authors collected studies for analysis at baseline people were stronger in the evening which suggests that people are naturally stronger in the evening the authors postulate that this could be due to increased body temperatures in the evening or perhaps some hormonal reason people who trained in the morning had no difference between strength tests in the morning or evening however those who trained the evening were stronger than they were in the morning this introduces a benefit to morning training as it will make you stronger throughout the entire day in contrast to evening training which would only make you stronger in the evening in terms of muscle hypertrophy no differences were found at all unfortunately all of these studies used maximal voluntary contractions to measure strength instead of repetition maximum tests repetition maximum tests are more practical because they test the strength of movements that you actually train in the gym there are also not many studies looking at time of training and muscle hypertrophy thus presenting a gap in the literature finally the studies were quite heterogeneous in terms of participants ages tldr people seem to be stronger in the evening at baseline however unlike evening training morning training will make you stronger throughout the entire day any conclusions regarding muscle growth is difficult to make due to the paucity of research on the subject though for now there appears to be no relationship the last paper we will look at was written by gonçalves et al caffeine is a stimulant that is often consumed prior to training to boost muscular strength and endurance its effects are well documented and the research strongly supports caffeine as a valuable ergogenic aid grgic et al the paper at hand investigated the effects of habitual caffeine intake on its efficacy during training in other words they ask if one were to consume caffeine regularly would they build a tolerance to it and experience less of its benefits in training the most likely theory for the way caffeine works is that it binds to adenosine receptors in the body amongst many functions adenosine can make one feel sleepy and even bring down the heart rate of the body now the worries that caffeine may have a reduced effect with habitual intake stem from the process where caffeine use will cause the body to create more adenosine receptors which allows more adenosine to bind to its receptors the scientists recruited male trained cyclists to take part in the experiment the study was designed in a crossover manner and in a doubleblinded fashion a crossover study means that all the participants got to try all treatments in this case every subject was supplemented with mgkg of caffeine for a week was given a placebo for another week and was given nothing for another week a double blind simply means that neither the scientists nor the subjects knew which treatment was being administered which helps reduce bias the cyclists were grouped according to their caffeine intake prior to being recruited into the study the low intake group consumed mgday on average the moderate intake group at mgday and the high intake group at mgday to put these numbers into perspective the high intake group is worth about ml cans of red bull in terms of caffeine the first day involved some simple body measurements as well as some testing to determine how much the cyclists needed to perform during real testing later on the next couple of days consisted of familiarization with the time trial tests that the cyclists would have to do the time trial basically required each cyclist to cycle a certain amount and then the time to completion would be measured caffeine hours before the time trial was restricted and a hour dietary recall before each test was also implemented to control caffeine intake subjects fasted hours before each time trial and if they were being supplemented with mgkg of caffeine it was done hour before the time trial rate of perceived exertion was also measured throughout the trial cyclists performed better when on caffeine compared to placebocontrol there was no difference between placebo and control rate of perceived exertion was similar between all treatments the same trends were seen regardless of caffeine intake habits that is to say even they were in the high habitual intake group the benefits from caffeine were the same it would appear that regardless of whether or not you consume a lot of caffeine you can still reap all the ergogenic benefits of the stimulant however i am curious to see if we would see the same results in a strength training context also it is worth noting that these results can only be generalized to males tldr whether you use a lot of caffeine or not you will not build a tolerance and not experience less benefits during training areta j l burke l m ross m l camera d m west d w d broad e m coffey v g timing and distribution

cwg1el,Fitness,2019-08-28 04:46:46,m lb to lb my year powerbuilding journey hi guys previous post was deleted hopefully i get it right this time been a long time lurker on here and i thought its finally time to give back to the community that helped me so much when i first started lifting thank you all for doing what you do and keep inspiringhelping everyone to pursue their fitness goals photos before and after photo weight lb kg to lb kg in the photos the lb weight represents my weight at the time of the after photo which was at the end of a cut weight climbed as high as lb during the bulk time period approximately years of progressive overload and eating at a surplus with a few cuts and breaks from weight training when i was travellingbusy with university lift progress summary please note that most of these numbers were achieved at a higher bodyweight of around lb kg to lb kg and does not reflect my strength when cut down deadlift conventional lb kg to lb kg deadlift sumo lb kg to lb kg bench lb kg to lb kg ohp lb kg to lb kg squat lb kg to lb kg xb program my goal was always to be both strong and big so i never really focused entirely on bodybuilding or powerlifting and always combined both training styles into my programming when i first started i ran a full body workout i think it was icf lol times a week but quickly grew out of it in a few months wanted to be at the gym more i then got some help and guidance from a friend who had been lifting for quite some time and he was running a variation of ogus i followed his template and then slowly started my accessories to it and it slowly adapted into a pplppl split the split would generally be something along these lines monday ohp following ogus rep schemes and shoulder accessories example workout would be x ohp at one rep max x arnold press x lateral raises x rear delt flies x face pulls x cable lateral raise tricep accessories vary tuesday hypertrophy back day example workout would be x body weight pull ups focusing on lats x bent over rows x cable pullovers x seated row x lat pulldown x single arm rows bicep accessories vary wednesday squats following ogus rep schemes and leg accessories example workout would be x squats at one rep max x walking lunges x leg hamstring curl x leg extension x leg press x straight leg deadlifts thursday bench following ogus rep scheme and chest accessories example workout would be x bench at one rep max x incline dumbell press x hammer strength machine x chest fly top down x chest fly bottom up x push ups x landmine presses friday deadlifts following ogus rep schemes and back accessories example workout would be x deadlift at one rep max deload x pull ups weighted x rowing movement x lat pulldown bicep accesories if there is time saturday rest or if i ended up gyming would be a hyper chest day sunday hypertrophy leg day example workout would be x front squads x close stance squat x good girl bad girl machine each side x hip thrusts i would also do core every second day which is usually just x hanging leg raises and x decline sit ups with weight behind head obviously working out days is not ideal for everyone and i would highly recommend at least taking a day off but it seemed to work for me and my body was handing it pretty well so i continued to do so i dont anymore fyi haha i basically followed this split for about years and had probably gone from lb to about lb at this point and then started to stall on my lifts especially on sets of at for most of my lifts those workouts are brutal and it takes over an hour to even get through just your compounds lol anyway at this point i think my lifts were s lb kg b lb kg dsumo lb kg however with progress slowing down i looked online for a different program that aligned with my goals thats when i found layne nortons ph a few of my friends at the gym had run this program already at this point so i asked around and the general consensus was that it was hard but a good program so i decided to run it link to the spreadsheet i used to track this fyi after completing ph my numbers were around s lb kg b lb kg dsumo kg which i was pretty happy with for months of training however the program is definitely hard and i would highly recommend not taking the amrap sets to failure as the fatigue definitely builds up i ended up with a very sore hip and elbow after many sessions still would highly recommend ph to most people though now it brings us to current time im sitting at around lb kg and ive been running smolov junior bench because i cant squat torn quad from going too ham after coming back from a holiday lol and been deadlifting once a week ive gone back to a pplppl split but been adding bench on top of normal workouts not doing many push accessories though recently maxed out bench and hit lb kg but really gunning for that kg bench lb xb diet diet hasnt changed significantly over the last few years with bulking diet and cutting diet remaining pretty similar apart from portion size below is a typical day of eating for me when cutting down breakfast toast peanut butter cereal milkalmond milk eggs with egg whites if i can be bothered and fruit lunch g cooked protein source chicken breast chicken tenderloins beef salmon beef mince g cooked carb source wholemeal pasta sweet potato brown rice basmati rice g vegetable brocolli beans asparagus frozen vege mixtures etc these meals are usually split into g protein g carb and g vege containers i meal prep around of these a week if i can i space these meals out hours so i technically have lunches dinner post gym g protein source g carb source g vege protein shake double scoop if requried snack some form of protein bar or snack that im craving rice crackers usually usually this adds up to about calories when im cutting when im bulking the meals are almost the same but i may have bigger breakfasts more snacks and my meals increase from g protein carb to g protein and carb i generally eat around calories when im bulking my macro targets are usually around g protein g fat and the rest carbs no matter if im bulking or cutting when i bulk im probably at a clean food cheat food ratio although i would say my cheat food is not considered cheat food all the time i make conscious decisions on eating protein rich junk foods like i would consider subway footlong a cheat food for me when i am dieting story i wont go too indepth but basically i have always been into sport mainly playing soccerfootball but once i got into university i stopped exercising and started living alone which made me extremely lazy i would always go the whole day eating one normal meal and would spend a lot of my time playing video games i started getting really bad acne on my face which made me super self conscious and slowly made me more and more anti social gyming actually didnt help this and i had to eventually seek professional help for this thats when i decided that something needed to change so i started working out at home around this time was when i started browsing rfitness and realized that i should probably be working out in a gym so i resigned up to my university gym and the rest is history i am extremely glad that i made that decision that day to resign up for the gym as now a lot of my closest friends are atfrom the gym and i genuinely look forward to going in everyday so thank you rfitness for changing my life if you want to see the full transformation message me on here and i can link you the video as transformation videos arent allowed here thank you all for reading and keep training hard were all gonna make it brahs edit fixed the excel spreadsheet link to ph im truly overwhelmed by how much this has blown up and im trying to reply everyone as best i can please give me some time and im sorry if i miss you thank you all for the support

7daoa2,Fitness,2017-11-16 06:47:41,year progress lb scrawny asian kid to lbs hitting plate squat plate bench m lb hi i just wanted to share the progress ive made these past few years since i finally hit some nice milestones pictures and videos are at the bottom of the post if you have any questions tips or whatever feel free to post progress story and workout program details i first began exercising in may as the typical skinny gamer nerd guy weighing in at lbs for the first few months i followed a bodyweight program due to feeling too intimidated to go to the gym i started drinking a ton of milk every day almost gomad just to gain weight i didnt keep track of calories in this time i started going to the gym around octobernovember and began with stronglifts x the app and website were extremely helpful in getting me accustomed to the primary lifts and took away some of the intimidation factor of going into the gym i followed stronglifts pretty consistently until april where i reached lbs eating with a caloric surplus or more every day at that point i asked reddit for advice and a few people told me to cut so i began eating at a deficit i also used to play a ton of basketball so i lost lbs pretty fast in about a month during my cut i switched to phul since trying to do x squats was absolutely miserable on a cut i also felt like my upper body was neglected and phul had a lot more variety in that area in between i bulked way too hard and made little progress so in january i was back at lbs i dialed it back down cutting down to by august i began bulking more cleanly this time i went from doing phul to day nsuns and have made a lot of progress in all of my lifts in the months ive been doing nsuns ive eaten at a calorie diet supposedly surplus according to and my body weight has gone from to lbs my lifts have drastically improved with bench increasing from x to x and squat increasing from x to x more final physique pictures at bottom of post tips if youre a beginner dont actually start with stronglifts x squats every day made me a trex with huge quads and no upper body id recommend beginners start with the more balanced greyskulls lp that you can find in this subreddits sidebar i was suffering from shoulder impingement issues for a long time but adding in rehab exercises such as band pull aparts facepulls and lying down side raises helped significantly also i worked on getting my form better and learned the cue of trying to pull the bar apart laterally this cue helped me greatly to reduce strain on my shoulders and activate my back more to create the back shelf to bench on also i incorporated this upper body stretching routine into my workouts minus the controversial sleeper stretch for squat switching from high to low bar helped me push through some nagging pains and plateaus additionally figuring out the valsalva maneuver and using a belt helped my form greatly for lower body days i always made sure to do stretching routine limber here nsuns is a great program and id recommend you get on it as soon as you stop making progress with a linear progression scheme i feel like i wasted a lot of time doing phul and the progress just wasnt there comparatively you can learn more about nsuns here i did the day variant since i like the dedicated overhead press day but any format should work fine do not dirty bulk or youll look and feel bad drink a ton of water i probably drink close to a gallon of water daily it just makes you feel better overall your muscles are mostly water so itll also help with strength be consistent with both diet and exercise skipping a day or even a week isnt the end of the world but if you have the spare time go to the gym having a huge meal or drinking with friends on occasion is totally fine as long as youre sticking to the diet the other of the time stretch and foam roll mobility creep is real and you have to adapt i mention which stretches i do in the previous part about shoulder problems and lower body work get a food scale and track what you can keep a mental record of things you ate and add the calories up in your head or just in your phone calculator app this is a relatively hasslefree way of tracking your daily intake gym is the easiest game in league or overwatch you lose rank sometimes if you play badly or your team sucks in gym you will always gain elo regardless of how shitty you do that day the only way to demote in gym is with ranked decay but this can easily be circumvented by playing games a week diet and supplements during lean bulk last months my diet during this bulk wasnt anything too special though i always made sure to keep high protein intake at least g a day my typical daily meal is a chipotle bowl with double chicken slices of bread with peanut butter bowls of cereal milk and filler food to meet the rest of my caloric goals usually fruits or eggs i also took several daily supplements including g creatine g fish oil epadpa iu vitamin d g beta alanine and a multivitamin i often mixed and used my own preworkout following the instructions from this post best in slot equips of course lifting gear wont make or break your progress but certain items really help when grinding for that next highest ilvl this could just be all placebo but hey anything that helps helps i suggest you only use them on heavier loads though since relying too much on them could hinder the development of the smaller muscles involved olympic lifting shoes i wear adipowers are great if youre looking to get more depth out of your squat they also allow me to squat very narrow which i find is stronger for me knee sleeves also add a bit of spring to your squat and help slightly with knee valgus i found that sbds were superior to rehbands in this regard after trying both knee sleeves also double as shin pads when doing conventional deadlift the belt is perhaps more useful than both of these most gyms will have these at the front desk if you just ask so learn how to use it the belt combined with proper valsalva maneuver helped me overcome some form problems and back pains when pushing for heavy deadlifts and squats wrist wraps are useful for ensuring your wrist stays straight on heavy benches if your wrists are particularly small like mine i just use a dollar pair from amazon chalk is great for bench and deadlift if you have clammy hands like me wrist straps are useful for grip limited exercises such as power shrugs rack pulls and possibly front squat if your mobility is lacking preworkout is not neccessary but something i find very useful if i feel lethargic or unmotivated that day taking preworkout will force me to use the energy in the gym it also helps me push for new prs which are sometimes quite scary especially squat if youre gonna raid you gotta bring flasks foam roller is last but certainly not least i believe this is an essential item to have and using it to properly stretch will benefit you greatly mobility and strength go hand in hand consistently foam rolling and stretching will not only make your lifts safer but also stronger a lacrosse ball can also be considered for more intense pinpoint rolling for some real problem spots such as hip flexors lifting stats progression may bodyweight lbs lifts nonexistant july bodyweight lbs bench x squat x deadlift x oh press x november bodyweight lbs

3gendo,Fitness,2015-08-10 00:27:29,female to male transgender year progress from small and girly to hairy and burly first off pics heres me at and about lbs i was weak and extremely depressed even for i was way underweight heres an updated pics about years later front side back shitty quality back pics are hard to do apparently fitness experience i played pee wee soccer when i was but i was mostly in it for the capri sun and orange slices ive been on hormone replacement therapy for just about years and lifting seriously for the other six months consisted of me doing a ton of cardio and machines and expecting muscles to magically appear under my pillow i weigh lbs starting out was pretty rough for me for any extremely small or generally unfit person the weight floor is pretty intimidating i had a fairly unexperienced friend teach me a little about dumbbells and form i had just graduated from the soft and vaguely moist cradle of machines to the wide world of freeweights though i had a few moves and a semidecent routine in my pocket i still knew almost nothing about diet being an obsessive neurotic i chose a day split the intense training and my tiny calorie diet meant that the only progress i made was from the testosterone naturally carving out my body diet eventually i figured out what a proper diet meant and i started making decent gains the feeling of going from not being able to lift a pound plate onto the leg press to benching my bodyweight is indescribable even with my knowhow my anxiety would often get the better of me and my weight fluctuated from frequently that might not seem like a lot but on such a small frame pounds makes a big difference my lowest weight was in march at after i got top surgery i started a calorieday bulk supplemented with creatine i gained about pounds in or months unfortunately i started and am continuing to have problems with severe untreatable acid reflux kill me so i fear that my progress may plateau again lifts bench deadlift squat though after having knee problems ive replaced normal back squat with front squats supplemented by the leg press for that round ass edit i was temporarily removed by the mods but im back baby edit i mistyped my deadlift its not im weak but not that weak edit the thread is locked up for the night thanks to all of you for the support and to the mods for keeping out the trash ill be away for several days but pm me if you have any big important things to say and i will get back to you when i return
7n8xff,Fitness,2017-12-31 15:10:56,folks each new year i like to give some advice to those of you or those of you starting swimming for fitness weight management or swimming improvement in the new year rather than rehashing last years post this year im giving specific tips this post is intended to be a simple list of what i think are the most important items for intermediate or new swimmers based on all the questions we get on swimmit and my own experience of what ive been asked over the years swimming is a sport that when done consistently will allow you to pursue it for an entire lifetime and reward you for doing do for those of you who do decide to take it up well look forward to seeing you in the water whether pool river lake or ocean rswimming is a good resource especially if you use the search bar as there is no question that hasnt been asked and gotten an answer previously keep swimming this is the most important lesson of any exercise or change program you have to keep doing it consistently you will feel rubbish at the beginning struggling to breathe will continue to feel so for a few weeks but by your fifth or sixth week you will feel far better understand that the real victory comes on the crappy thursday evening after a long day at work when you could give up but instead you make yourself go for a swim instead sure you can swim half what you usually do ill bet you that once you actually go swimming youll start to feel better and do more a year of crappy thursday nights though when all added together will wipe the memory of each and every one of them away skill and talent at swimming are less essential than consistency and work those older swimmers who seem to swim so effortlessly thats not because of a talent or special training you didnt get its because they keep swimming swim three times a week at least people ask us this question we give them this answer they dont like the answer they give up because its too much selfperpetuating problem heres the real story three times a week isnt that much since swimming is technically difficult i usually say the minimum required is four times a week but if you are getting started commit to three days a week of at least minutes per time look lets be honest here swimming is technically difficult to become proficient at if your only goal is some weight loss eat less go for a walk every day that will work if you would like to do those and develop a skill that will last you the rest of your life you need to start swimming regularly swimming will become part of your life and for that to happen you will have to fall a little in love with it with the fluid expression of grace in the water or the sound of your exhalation underwater or the meditative aspect of developing skill and mastery triathletes i still telling you people at least four times a week and ive heard all your excuses get a proper swimsuit and goggles if you let something as simple as wearing a tight swimsuit be a constraint to keeping swimming stop now and lets not waste any more time anything loose causes drag which will make your swimming harder and make you less likely to improve wearing baggy suits or board short is not like running with weights it will not benefit endurance or strength it will simply make your swimming worse weve seen more almost naked people of every shape that most people who arent a paid professional of some kind noone cares what i or you look like i understand you might be a bit selfconscious or shy thats your first challenge overcome that fake it until you dont care and you are on your way and dont even think about being a regular swimmer without goggles they are the most important invention in the history of swimming including any of the modern strokes edit since none of the apparel companies or even many swimmers understand the differences in goggles i wrote an article a few years ago explaining the main different types of goggles and how to choose among them dont eat an hour before swimming its an old wifes tale about eating an hour before swimming will cause cramps what it will do is start your body digesting food and making you feel lethargic during your swim as less blood is available for exercise also contrary to what almost everyone you know will tell you you do not need to eat before exercise if you have a normal diet you are carrying about two and half thousand calories in glycogen in your blood and liver thats enough for two hours of intensive exercise endurance swimmers like myself and other endurance athletes actually rely on this ability to perform at their sport dont eat immediately after swimming the single most important reason that swimming is often poor for weight control is that since water is colder even a heated pool than body temperature it stimulates an increase in metabolism in an attempt to increase core temperature this drives an increase in appetite and people eating too much you are not hungry from the exercise of swimming for beginners you are hungry from thermogenesis the internal metabolic production of heat teach yourself to ignore it maybe drink some milk at the start untiul you are used to it breathe out underwater if swimming has a secret its this you have no idea how many times we get asked on swimmit about breathing difficulties a common phrase i hear is im a good swimmer i just have difficulty with the breathing whereas those two are mutually exclusive one simple search will provide thousands of instances of this question please people is using the search box so difficult exhale with your face underwater try and do it in a controlled fashion rather than a sudden explosive breath keep doing that heres an actual trick to help hum if you hum while your face is underwater it will help control your breathing and exhalation get some technique advice youll notice how little of the above has to do with actually swimming this bit is about swimming if you are the kind of person who can stay at something because its difficult to master swimming is perfect for you i could say get lessons but all you really need is someone who knows about swimming technique a good swimmer maybe a lifeguard maybe not to look at what you are doing and then make changes according to what they tell you you cannot figure this out for yourself i am always happy to help someone who might ask other experienced swimmers are the same because we all got here the same way with the help of others watching us telling us what we are doing wronglessons or coaching are great but i dont like spending your money for you and you can improve this way you improve by finding out what part most needs to get better then doing drills to correct that beginners hate drills because they feel slow and often unproductive so they dont do drills which is why some people can actually swim for or in the case of one guy in my pool years and never improve here are a couple of the best drills for front crawl aka freestyle im not involved in any of these videos i simply did a youtube search side drills slow boring but the most important drill of all these help with balance rotation and the allimportant breathing you start this with your arms by your side or one extended in front do a couple of lengths of each then start to add a rotation and one arm pull eventually move to doing a rotation and pull every kick strokes raise your legs wall kicks are really good legs too low in the water are the second biggest problem after inability to breathe the main causes are lifting your head too much poor ankle flexibility and bicycle kicking from your knees instead of hips im going to give you another easy tip clench your butt cheeks together this will reduce your ability to kick your lower legs and will start to raise your body to be more horizontal fist drill this is a stable of most experienced swimmers toolbox its difficult frustrating slow feels horrible and immensely valuable swim some lengths of front crawl with your hands in fists instead of open then go back to swimming normally it will have all kinds of positive effects mainly you will start to use your forearms for propulsion which will improve your position and reduce drag yes you will be fisting the water there are hundred of drills covering all aspects of your stroke try to spend the first ten minutes of every swim doing these above and addsubstitute some more depending on what feedback you have on your stroke understand lane etiquette following basic lane etiquette is the swimming equivalent of putting the weight backs on the racks and wiping down the bench after you use it or putting the flag back in the little hole or so i understand from fittit i dont even lift bro swimmers like other swimmers if you understand and follow etiquette which lifeguards and pool management dont in general understand you can swim in a lane with people of differing speeds and do so comfortably for everyone use the clock a very common mistake for new swimmers is mixing up shortness of breath with exertion people take rests that are far too long the primary use of the pace clock for new swimmers in most pools is not purely to time fast swims but to ensure you are swimming on a consistent interval so you can use it to time your rests for most people for most swims rest shouldnt be longer than seconds and better to only take warming up is more important difficult than you realise unlike the way say movies portray effort humans require a period of increasing physical load to enable our hearts to beat faster and provide more oxygen to sustain more effort the warming up phase has us feeling sluggish and unfit until our hearts can beat enough to provide the necessary oxygen once warmed up you will swim harder faster and better dont make the mistake of thinking that how you feel in the first five or ten minutes is all your are capable of which is a very common mistake that often stops people not familiar with physical exercise warming up is difficult in water for people struggling with breathing btw have fun you can start whenever and if you want to swim the english channel i estimate you can attempt it in a mere to years depending on whether you can swim at all right now my own speciality is distance open water swimming and my own blog on the subject is the world most popular if you fancy dropping by its not financial i make no money from any of this i just love open water swimming
6qpn9c,Fitness,2017-07-31 16:44:01,been consistently going to the gym for the last year heres our progress twins update had a ton of support on our last post and posted to rprogresspics this morning so decided to have an updated post on this sub first progress pics and link to our previous post a picture of us together austin height weight comparison picture from beginning to now lifts in lbs bench squat deadlift bonus flex album justin height weight comparison picture from beginning to now lifts in lbs bench squat deadlift bonus flex album bench doesnt appear to improve much for either since our last post but we went from touchandgo to competitionlegal paused bench to prepare for our first powerlifting competition training stuck to one program and added modifications as we saw fit from our last post we quickly stalled with that homemade program we switched to nsuns and that gave us a ton of progress we modified it on preference and eventually we came up with our program its designed so we try to increase our working max every two weeks as well as training in a variety of rep ranges if anything on it is unclear please let us know and wed be happy to clarify diet iifym we try to get a minimum of grams of protein a day as opposed to like last time even though people recommend g of protein per pound of bodyweight we feel like our progress has significantly improved by sticking to the grams of protein especially during our cut during cuts we eat at around which was lbs a week deficit during the summer we walk a lot as we have no car and the gym is miles one way during the schoolyear our tdees are closer to were doing our first bulk in a long time and our first long bulk right now were eating everyday and it seems to be going well competing we competed in our first powerlifting meet on july th austin got first place in teens and th in the lightweight division overall justin got nd place in teens and th overall and beat the teen georgia state deadlift record with a kg deadlift not going to clog this post with this but go to this link if you want to read more about it and feel free to comment on it as well thought to end this post with points that we wish we knew before we started lifting get on a program we just did random x workouts at first and while we made some amazing progress getting on nsuns made everything skyrocket our modifications was after running it for a bit to fit our preferences but the bottom line is that if youve never lifted before follow something from someone who knows what they are doing will be your best bet protein we had to cut at a significant rate for our powerlifting competition lbs a week we went from lbs to lbs and lbs to including water cut in a month our bench digressed by lbs but our other lifts both improved by at least lbs we strongly attribute that to keeping our intensity as high as we could manage while mitigating the risk for injury as well as having a lot of protein grams eating calories dont assume a cut means youll lose strength sorta add on to the previous point but we were terrified that we would lose strength for our competition but as we previous stated most of our lifts went up during our drastic deficit and water cut count your calories we mentioned this during our last post but we think counting your calories is absolutely vital for success unless youre eating the same mealprepped foods every day knowing what you put in your body is invaluable consistency it wont happen overnight some days youll be bloated and look terrible some days you look great some days you just dont want to go to the gym honestly just push through it making going to the gym a habit or whatever your chosen physical activity will make the whole process smoother edit becuase we have a lot of skepticism yes we are completely natural the biggest proof we have is when we were drug tested for our powerlifting competition we have never and dont plan to ever hop on steroids

efpwxj,Fitness,2019-12-26 03:07:11,review of recent fitness studies vii more squats blood flow restriction and strength training hello everyone hope you are all having a wonderful christmas season it is a time for family to get together as well as eat a lot of food however i hope everyone has been keeping fit as usual ive collected a few very recent studies about fitness health and nutrition to condense them into easytoread summaries for all of you i hope to create some discussion below any tips for writing presentation analysis or anything else would be greatly appreciated enjoy squat depth is a contentious subject in the fitness literature due to its uncertainties in the context of injury risk muscle hypertrophy strength gains translation into sports performance and more the literature teeters to both ends of the spectrum as hartmann et al showed superior functional adaptations for the full squat when compared to shallower squats however more recently rhea et al found that quarter squats may actually be better for improving sprinting and jumping thus pallarés et al sought to clear up the doubt by comparing full squats parallel squats and half squats with the following outcomes in mind one repetition maximum maximum propulsive velocity jump tests sprint tests wingate tests as well as physical disability measurements as a proxy for injury risk lets just quickly go over what some of this means a full squat in the context of this study is a very deep squat where the thighs meet the calves on the descent a parallel squat is where the crease made at the groin is in line with the top of the knee a half squat is descending until your knee joint forms a deg angle the outcomes will be explained as we go along men with a squat training history were recruited and split into four groups full squat parallel squat half squat and a control group the control group obviously did not partake in any resistance training so we can see if external factors that are not being measured are at play training was twice a week for ten weeks and the load slowly increased from to of their one repetition maximum participants did sets of repetitions with four minutes of rest between sets an interesting aspect of this study is that instead of determining one repetition maxima traditionally lifting heavier and heavier until you cannot lift against the resistance essentially paying attention to the load lifted they used mean propulsive velocity which just means they measured the speed at which the bar moves and once it slows enough we have determined the one repetition maximum this is better because we can track objective variables and numbers here using this velocitybased method is valid as it was used in a study with the same lifts recently and it showed a close relationship with the traditional loadbased method martínezcava et al several familiarization sessions were done to learn the exercises before the ten week training programme began the full squat group saw improvements across all outcomes they increased their one repetition maximum in all three types of squats they had better sprints and jumps as well as better wingate test results the wingate test is essentially a test for power work done over time on a cycling machine the parallel squat group had similar results to the full squat group though to smaller extents the half squat group made did not make great strength gains even for the half squat one repetition maximum the power hardly changed and the peak power actually decreased jump heights improved slightly however the sprint times were unchanged the half squat group actually saw the worst results when it came to the western ontario and mcmaster universities osteoarthritis index the western ontario and mcmaster universities osteoarthritis index is a series of likert scales ratings of subjective feeling initially used in hospitals to evaluate pain stiffness and functional disability in osteoarthritis joint degeneration generally in knees hips and hands patients however it has been used for a wide variety of rheumatological disorders the half squat group saw large increases in all variables measured by the western ontario and mcmaster universities osteoarthritis index unlike the other groups deeper squats may not have an increased knee injury risk despite higher knee flexion angles because of various reasons the wrapping effect is a mechanism in which the quadriceps tendon makes better contact with the femur as we descend further in the squat rendering the knee joint more stable the softtissue contact between the calf and the thigh in a deep squat may also provide support hartmann wirth klusemann like previous studies there was a degree of specificity that came to light groups made the best strength gains at the depth they trained at however the full squat group still made better strength gains in the half squat if we make group to group comparisons another point to note is that the control group had several decrements in performance due to detraining this further reinforces the idea that the trained population will suffer in performance after extended periods of sedentary lifestyle tldr the deeper you go in a squat the better your outcomes strength sprints power jumping and this is likely without an increased risk for injury reminder that this study was only done in trained men so keep that mind with application to populations flexion of the lumbar spine basically the spine segment located in the lower back has long been thought to be associated with lower back pain this has led to interventions in occupational health proper biomechanics and use of braces as well as in the fitness world especially in exercises such as the deadlift however is the association at hand really as strong as we think saraceni et al very recently conducted a metaanalysis pooling studies together review on the literature regarding this very question they specifically aimed to see i if lumbar flexion is a risk factor for lower back pain and ii if the degree of lumbar flexion is different between those with or without lower back pain in total they managed to gather studies with a total of participants for analysis overall the quality of evidence was deemed to be low however there was no evidence to suggest that lumbar flexion was a risk factor for lower back pain though lumbar load may be a risk factor to quote critically to date no study that has directly measured the lumbar spine during lifting has found a relationship between lbp and greater lumbar flexion people with lower back pain on average actually flexed slightly less at the lumbar spine when lifting unfortunately this finding was clouded in heterogeneity which means that the papers that were pooled together in analysis were conducted so differently from each other that it becomes difficult to put them together this finding may also be a result of reverse causality ie people with lower back pain flex less because of the pain not the other way around careful applications of this study into resistance training world must be done as the maximum load of all the studies included was kilograms tldr no evidence to suggest a relationship between the degree of lumbar flexion and low back pain blood flow restriction training is gaining more traction in the training world as more and more studies appreciate its efficacy it is executed by partially occluding the targeted muscles blood supply via tourniquet or other means and training with this occlusion it has its place in recreational training as well as in rehabilitation as it allows healing jointstissues to exercise with lighter loads while still reaping the benefits you would receive from higher loads an important aspect to consider however is the effect of blood flow restriction training on the tendons involved this is critical because if muscle adapts to a greater extent then its tendons do an imbalance between the structures may lead to injury centner et al took untrained men and separated them into three groups a group that trained with of one repetition maximum loads with normal resistance training a group with of one repetition maximum loads with blood flow restricted training and one control group the training groups followed their respective exercise programmes for weeks the traditional resistance training group did three sets of standing calf raises and three sets of sitting calf raises with repetitions each for the other group the scheme was similar but one set of repetitions was done before each exercise so in total eight sets would be done as opposed to six in the other group repetitions were done for the rest of the sets the pressure used was set at a occlusion and was kept on between sets but not between exercises training was held three times per week after weeks the achilles tendon the tendon which joins the calf muscle to the ankle crosssectional area grew similarly between training groups the same can be said about gastrocnemius calf muscle crosssectional area muscle stiffness and maximum voluntary torque force produced by calf muscle youngs modulus changes stress divided by strain a property that tells us the stiffness of a material was said to be statistically insignificant between and within groups though the high load training group had an increased youngs modulus while the blood flow restricted groups had decreased increases in stiffness are likely because of the increased size of the tendon rather than any changes in the material properties of the tendon the tendon adaptations we find in the blood flow restricted group may be explained by the theory of metabolic stress inducing an increased production of fibroblasts a cell which supports a tendons integrity by synthesizing collagen and other structural proteins a valuable part of the study that is missing is another group that trains with low loads but without blood flow occlusion as that would help isolate the variable of blood flow occlusion from other variables such as load another limitation that the authors highlighted was that the method of measuring tendon crosssectional changes via ultrasound is not the most accurate technique especially when compared to sensitive procedures such as magnetic resonance imaging mri tldr positive tendon adaptations still occur in those who do blood flow restricted training for young untrained men over the years we have begun to realize that muscle hypertrophy does not require as much as we thought for it to occur low volumes low frequencies low repetitions high rest they all seem to work even intensities as low as of your repetition maximum are enough to induce hypertrophy mitchell et al can the same be said about muscle strength androulakiskorakakis fisher steele performed a metaanalysis and review on the subject amassing six different studies total it was found that volume as low as one set of repetitions per week for weeks was enough for muscle strength to increase all sets in the studies were done to muscle failure most studies had some form of progression between training sessions loads were generally within the repetition maximum range so if strength changes can reliably occur at lower loads repetition maximum is a question that still has yet to be answered this point may be moot from an efficiency standpoint as working with lower loads would require higher repetitions to failure thus taking up more time we also do not know if we can get significant strength gains at repetitions lower than five to six assuming while still maintaining a frequency of one set per week furthermore these findings are limited to the squat and bench press only the deadlift unfortunately does not have enough research to make any concrete statements most of this data was gleaned from trained athletes however while they were technically resistancetrained their personal records and training history would only be considered to be at an intermediate level from an advanced perspective despite having few studies to work with all the studies were of high methodological quality one final limitation is that these results can only be extrapolated to males the authors make a recommendation that the minimum effective training scheme would be to train one set of repetitions times a week at a high intensity of effort most likely in the one repetition maximum range tldr the authors make a recommendation that the minimum effective training scheme would be to train one set of repetitions times a week at a high intensity of effort most likely in the one repetition maximum range with bodybuilding it is often recommended to eat at a caloric surplus ie eating more calories than you burn daily while training this is sound advice because your body does need more energy for building the new tissue maintaining the tissue and dealing with the altered metabolism that the body undergoes with training and muscle tissue accretion however there are a lot more variables that go into this and there is an immense amount of nuance slater et al aimed to present and discuss all the variables as well as unravel all the confusion do we need a surplus in the first place it would seem so given the theory above energy restrictions have been shown to interfere with muscle protein synthesis but this can be alleviated with training and a higher protein intake so it is likely still possible to experience hypertrophy in a caloric deficit but this is probably only reasonably applicable to the overweight or untrained more research needed despite eating a caloric surplus being ubiquitous as a guideline it is interesting to note that there is no controlled trial where they studied the relationship between a caloric surplus and muscle hypertrophy from resistance training over an extended period of time however we can look at overfeeding studies where participants are eating at a caloric surplus while not resistance training in these studies we do see gains in fatfree mass there are mathematical formulae out there to calculate what is the ideal surplus for your hypertrophy goals however no formulae takes into account all the complex biological processes that occur with muscle hypertrophy these formulae are also based off of people who do not resistance train metabolism can be vastly different in athletes for example dietinduced thermogenesis heat producedcalories burnt simply from eating can be higher for athletes as their protein intakes are generally higher takes more energy to digest protein there is also the question of how you should distribute the surplus throughout the day or week for example carbohydrates may be good before or during high volume training yet there is no strong research in that area another common example is having a larger surplus on training days to make up for the training the macronutrient distribution of the surplus is also relevant the authors recommend gkgday of carbohydrates of caloric intake with fat and gkgday of protein three meals spread across the day with snacks interspersed between also appears to be effective in total a daily calorie surplus seems to be an appropriate number to start with but it requires constant review throughout the training programme tldr not a lot is known about a caloric surplus and its effects on muscle hypertrophy while training however a small surplus of kcalday with appropriate macronutrient distribution appears to be a good starting point for most people wanting to build muscle

2eh0r2,Fitness,2014-08-24 21:05:26,before and after f lblb before and after measurements bust waist hips thighs biceps calves my weight loss started at when i moved away to university armed without the faintest of idea on nutrition i lost about lbs in years by eating less but not healthily my diet consisted of enough alcohol to float a boat uni dont judge enough coffee to tide me over until it were an acceptable time to drink pm incase youre wondering and one solid meal a day because i was usually too lazy and too hungover to stomach much i dont advice this at all obviously after finishing uni i spent the summer feeling sick and run down so i bought a bunch of books on nutrition and eventually decided to go vegan the transition into vegan was bumpy to begin with as i didnt ease into it but instead threw myself into the deep end i spent the first few weeks bewildered at what exactly i could eat that was of substance so i ordered a few cookbooks and learnt to put together meals these are some of the cookbooks i recommend for those that are interested easy vegan by ryland peters small vegan feats by rose elliot honestly healthy by natasha corrett harumis japanese cooking skinny bitch by kim barnouin sweet vegan for dessert recipes as requested some tips for those looking to keep it as inexpensive as possible beans nuts legumes rice and grains are fantastic staples and also very cheap to buy buy in bulk if thats available to you local ethnic shops tend to sell the aforementioned staples for a lot less than chain supermarkets so pay them a visit and support a local business at the same time forgo the supermarkets in favor of farmers markets or weekend market stalls depending on where you live and whats available this can shave off over rds from your weekly fruit and veg shop frozen vegetable are just as good as fresh so stock up since then i have dropped the remaining lbs and built a decent amount of muscle im very lucky not to have been left with any loose skin probably because i lost the weight over a long period of time and that i moisturize religiously drink a ton of water and also my age inner thighs and back of arms still feel a bit squidgy but overall nothing too noticeable diet i keep an balance healthy and indulgent a sample of my daily intake looks something like this breakfast big bowl of fruit along with granola and almond milk snack handful of almonds and walnuts lunch salad consisting of black beans salad leaves butternut squash pumpkin seeds and a splash of avocado oil and lemon juice snack banana dinner vegetable stir fry dessert dark chocolate i like to keep it as natural as possible and im not a fan of soy products because protein on a vegan diet is pretty easy to get with some proper planning i total at about calories because i workout days a week and im fairly active outside of work alcohol i obviously dont drink nearly as much as i used to because im a grownup laydeee and stuff nowadays its no more than drinks a week and yes along with the occasional blowout im not gonna lie once a month if that drinks litres of water daily one americano in the morning cups of black tea and cups of green tea throughout the day no energy drinks or fizzy drinks macros c fp i stay as close to this as possible after a couple of years of fiddling with the ratio with being the worst by far this is what works for me supplements i avoid vegan protein powders soy pea etc because they taste like ass and ive yet to find one that i can tolerate i only take a daily vitamin d tablet iu in the autumn and winter and a weekly b ug i get annual bloods done and everything is within the healthy range exercise when i went vegan i also took up running which was great and i loved it but soon noticed that it wasnt really doing anything to change the shape of my body but instead was just shrinking it and so for a long time i had that skinnyfat look eventually i incorporated boxing and pilates and that definitely helped to strengthen my core and give me a bit more definition real change didnt start to happen until months ago one of the trainers at my gym has the most incredible butt midforties and in better shape than of people my age so after months of just ogling her arse like a creep i asked her what the hell it is she does to get such a glorious behind and she introduced me to the area of the gym id avoided like the plague yes the weights since then ive been doing a mix of bodyweight exercises pushups situps planks dips donkey kicks and weight exercises squats deadlifts lunges glute bridges

4g8ijs,Fitness,2016-04-24 15:16:12,over at rbodyweightfitness the warmup section of our routine consists of many dynamic mobility stretches and to make it lessoverwhelming i made a followalong video that strings them all together efficiently full warm up video here this was posted on rbwf recently and id like to share it here as well in my quest to make our recommended routine easier to follow this single video will help warmup your shoulders and wrists without having to go through many separate videos which was very daunting i did my best to make it flow and the pace should be appropriate for beginners just like i did before with the bodyline drills the warm up consists of the following individual exercises reps exercise status shoulder rolls new scapular shrugs unchanged catcamelscatcows unchanged band straight arm overhead pull downs new band straight arm chest flies new band dislocates unchanged wrist mobility exercises unchanged front and side leg swings updated vid why does one need to warmup a good warm up will limber you up and activate the muscles necessary for strength training it also provides a crucial opportunity to check in with your body and gauge how your joints are responding to movement so i tried to make this sequence very mindful if an area feels tight or painful its a sign that you should probably warm it up some more and be cautious on how you proceed with your strength training to make sure you do not exacerbate any warning signs hope that helps edit wow you guys upvotes with a upvote rate this is amazing thank you so much for the support im so glad people are enjoying it if you wanna see more related stuff you could check out the behind the scenesbloopers clips and dont forget to subscribe to my youboob for more good stuff

5rbh33,Fitness,2017-01-31 22:24:28,from pounds to pounds in one year heres the progress that i have made i wanted to lose weight for a long time ever since i started th grade i was very insecure about my weight and the way that i looked i always thought that maybe i would just grow into my body and get better looking when i got older that was not the case after my first semester of college i was extremely depressed my father had passed away about a half a year before that and i noticed i was laying in bed a lot wallowing in my own self pity i was morbidly obese i was convinced that i would be alone forever and all i could do was lay in bed and go to school i finally got the motivation and courage to ask my mother if she would be willing to get ymca passes for the family so i could start losing weight for a while me and my whole family were going to the gym soon everyone else gave up but i kept going i loved it both cardio and working out the feeling that i got afterwards was amazing it was like being high but better ive been going to the gym since january th of i remember the date because it was the time i started to really turn things around in my life ive never felt better and i plan on continuing to better myself my final goal weight is pounds but my current goal is and im almost there then it will be this subreddit is something that got me going too and i wanted to show you lovely bastards what you did thank you i started off doing sl x but after about three months of that i moved on to a lot of different workout routines that i cant remember off the top of my head but the most recent one ive started is ppl on mondays and thursdays triceps shoulders and chest on tuesdays and fridays biceps traps and back on wednesdays and saturdays legs i also do about minutes of cardio everyday at least minutes of running on a treadmill never less than that and the rest of the time i do cardio on a bike when i first started out tho i did minutes of nothing but an elliptical i thought it was a way of bitching out of running on a treadmill at first but i found it to be very effective by the end of the first weeks i had lost pounds edit thank you everyone it means so much to me that you all left these kind words i recently have started feeling more and more confident in myself and this just solidifies my confidence even further i wanna become the best version of myself and i plan on doing it with you guys ill update as i progress further a lot of people have also been asking about my diet i have no real extensive diet plan all i try to do is eat a decent amount of vegetables with a decent amount of high protein meat like chicken and i was going at about calories at first but had to increase the calories during the spring of because of plateaus that i kept hitting but when the weight is coming off i try to stick to about calories a day consisting of pretty much veggies and meat no real specifics there and im sorry for that but its not something i plan too much considering i am pretty busy most of the time and have no time to prepare my own food as i have work school and the gym to attend sorry i know when i first started losing weight i would come here to find out good dieting techniques but to tell the truth the thing that works best for me is basically eat less food also cut out soda entirely as well as sugar and other junk food good snack foods are things like almonds and walnuts and other nuts like that i pretty much never eat breakfast anymore because i have to wake up early enough for my classes thats pretty much it though thank you all so much for the kind words it feels amazing for people to call me an inspiration to them there is truly no feeling like it that i have experienced
2wkscn,Fitness,2015-02-20 19:12:14,years progress f nsfw ive been wanting to share my progress for a while now and i finally feel like im at a spot where its worth it i carried probably of my extra fat on my stomach on my upper arms and the remaining throughout the rest of my body i really hate my old photos but its nice to have them for comparison summarized progress the first photos i took and the most recent photos side by side detailed progress with dates and weights since i only started lifting halfway into my diet its interesting to see how lifting started changing my body current measurements waist hips current lifts squat lbs bench lbs ohp lbs one armed rows lbs deadlifts ended at lbs ___________ a year ago just after valentines day i decided to get into shape this was with a caring gentle loving nudge from my boyfriend its not an easy conversation so props and thank you to him i had been feeling gross and insecure about my body for a few months at that point but was in denial so hearing it from him was the push i needed to get my head out from under the sand id like to add i was about lbs when we started dating in so this was a slow increase in weight i started my lifestyle change right away my biggest problem was that my portions were too big my tdee is about cals and i was eating the same portions as my boyfriend whos tdee is i cut my calories to but ate pretty much whatever i wanted as long as i budgeted for it and it worked i guess i was technically doing if with a cycle but that was just coincidental since ive never been a big breakfast eater anyways i was also doing couch to k at the same time but had to stop after a few weeks because of an old ankle problem that came up again so i just dieted for a couple of months id also like to note that i avoided the scale and taking photos like the plague for the first month it felt like too much pressure but i know from a prior drs appointment that i was sitting around lbs the beginning of once i was close to dipping below i started going to the gym and doing ss x days a week because of this i increased my calories to a day i still ate whatever i wanted and would drink protein after workouts i did not count the protein towards my calories the lifts really changed the way my body looked i never had much of a separation between my lower back and my butt but its emerging now and i went from thinking i looked good at in august to comparing that to me at now and thinking i looked kind of fat its pretty crazy i know my squat seems pretty low but thats because ive been dealing with it band pain that required me to drop weight and increase really slowly back in november i was squatting lbs ive stepped away from deadlifts while i get my squat back up because the issue in my legs is probably acute compartment syndrome and i can reduce the inflammation by not using my legs too much and i like squats more than dl after the new year i dropped my calories back down to ive got lbs of fat that id like to lose isnt a hard limit for me either i try to stick to it most of the time but if i wantneed to ill eat more as long as i dont pass its been two months of the calories and im definitely seeing some fat loss between the january pics and the photos i took today ____ my advice for others be committed and give yourself rewards for hitting milestones by giving yourself a reason other than i want to look good youll be less likely to slip i waited until id lost the st lbs to get a haircut i really wanted i got to buy myself new dresses after my old ones were too big then i decided i wanted to do a really good mystique cosplay and could absolutely not be out of shape for it and that gave me another goal to work towards bonus photo of the result this was august th lbs i tried to drop water weight for days prior tell as few people as possible about your goals i only told my boyfriend my best friend and my mom in the beginning it wasnt until i was very close to my end goal that i told anyone else this was because i wanted to avoid comments like what you look fine you dont need to diet or oh come on you can have one and when my friends asked my why i wasnt drinking anything at parties id just say i was taking medication that didnt let me drink which brings me to cut out alcohol seriously i didnt drink from february to september i did the math for my deficit and it just wasnt worth it on some days when i had cals left after dinner i might have had a beer or a glass of wine but i almost always opted for a candy bar instead mmmm chocolate the bonus now is that my tolerance is pretty low haha dont subtract calories from exercise unless you do something that burns shittons of calories first of all the calories estimates for exercise in mfp are wayyyyy off they are way too generous ive seen it tell people that walking miles burned calories people complain that they diet and exercise but dont lose weight well if you are counting exercise towards your diet and use mfp for that im not surprised second of all im of the opinion that if youre trying to lose weight why run miles and then eat those extra calories you could be losing weight by keeping that deficit as long as youre eating at least the minimum your body needs you dont have to replenished those calories burned through exercise however id like to reiterate that if you do some exercise that burns tons of calories like intense swimming you should probably eat those back but if youre doing those exercises youre probably in excellent shape and not trying to lose weight either p _______________ thanks so much for reading if you have any questions feel free to ask and if you have any advice im all ears d _____ edit thank so much for all the questions and feed back im trying to answer everyone and according to my comment history there are replies ive made that arent showing up here mods think reddit may be misbehaving but i hope youre receiving my replies im going to walk

jm6paq,Fitness,2020-11-01 17:59:58,from boy to man my transformation m kg kg kg summary european obese person with a broken pituitary gets his shit together at yo goes through medically induced puberty opens the door of a gym and never looks back introduction background hello fellow fitness lovers ive been eager to share this transformation with you guys this is probably not going to be your typical transformation post but i really hope you will get something out of it it all started just about years ago when i opened the door of a gym for the very first time i was fat sick miserable and i had no idea that opening that door would mean so much to me see i was years old at that time yet i was trapped in the body of a yearold due to complications at birth part of my brain commanding the hormones was damaged and i hadnt been through puberty yet my body was a wreck and my mind was a mental prison fitness gave me a purpose and saved my life it was exactly the tool i needed and thats what ill focus on in this post starting stats age kg bf cm stats now age kg bf south of or so i hope before and after picture left age right age i started my transformation at kilos but as i had never really taken a shirtless picture for the beforeafter im using my first shirtless selfie just about a year in back then i had already lost kilos at the gym and was about to start hrt when i started my transformation this was my physique with clothes face gains kept some loose skin unfortunately nothing i can do about it so i wont dwell on it full album warning there is a gore picture of an injury in this album exercise situation before i started out at kg and almost no muscle at all i couldnt do a bodyweight squat without hurting my knees and i couldnt bench the bar my body was a wreck due to hormonal deficiencies and any exercise would leave me in pain for almost a week after even hiking i have to be honest due to being bullied at school i hated sport if only i knew then what i know now knowledge is power well when i started out i didnt know anything about training like literally i had to learn everything from scratch the last time i exercised was in school and i was always last other than the owner of my first gym showing me things i never had a coach at the beginning weight loss was my main concern i lost kilos doing simple cardio on the elliptical in the gym times per week i only started lifting after about a year and injured myself quite quickly being an idiot looking at what others were doing wrists shoulders elbows knees fingers everything that moves has gone through injury i wont go into details but once i started hormonal replacement therapy i have to replace crucial hormones my body isnt making things started clicking for me things i wish i knew before starting out warming up is crucial spotreduction is a myth you cant just burn fat where you want abs are kitchen dont listen to bro science you wouldnt believe all the s i heard in the gym over the years mind muscle connection is a thing having a workout plan is essential ego lifting doesnt get you anything except injuries form this might be the most important one learning how to perform an exercise properly in the beginning i looked at others in the gym which is utterly idiotic but i didnt know better my first research on proper form were scott hermans videos on youtube also watched a lot of formcheck posts on this sub and peoples feedback tracking lifts big bigger biggest no one gives a damn were all there to work on ourselves and thats what matters i was way too selfconscious going to the gym in the beginning under resting sleep and rest periods are essential to be honest with you guys i have been the perfect newbiefuckaroundits example for a long time too long i could write books about mistakes i made but lets focus on what i do now what i do now i have tried a lot of different workout programs from bodybuildingcom and reddit i stuck to shortcut to size and shortcut to shred from jim stoppani for quite some time but the one i found that suits me the most now is a simple ppl split from reddit i do days on day off things started getting better and better since im lurking on this sub i am training in different gyms every week due to my current lifestyle and i love alternating between dumbbells barbells and machines for the same movement pattern due to going to commercial gyms i often have to change the order of my exercises and improvise im not the kind of guy that waits minutes next to a bench press my typical split push day chest shoulders triceps sets of bench press with dumbbells machine or bar sets of incline or decline press i love the decline to sets of flys sets of shoulder press or military press sets lateral raises to sets of triceps pressdown skullcrushers triceps machine pull day back biceps sets of lateral pulldowns sets of rows one arm vbar dumbbell machine i would love to master the bent over rows but they always spark lower back pain so i need to work on that to sets of pull ups mostly on assisted machine even if i dont use any weight im still scared of making a fool out of myself doing it at the pulley sets of straight arm pulldowns sets curls with dumbells barbell cable leg day the limbs i cant maneuver for the rest of the week sets of squats or to sets of leg press as i do my legs every days i like to alternate between starting with squats or leg press sets of leg extensions to sets of leg curls seated leg curls depending on gym sets of lunges usually without any weight i really should incorporate straight leg deadlifts for my hamstrings but i always hurt my lower back with this definitely a point i should work on i generally work in the range but like to change things up or down from time to time i drop set on the last set of a muscle group some numbers benchpress sets of xkg with dumbbells started with kg hurting my shoulders thanks to bad form legpress up to plates on each side depends on the machine different from gym to gym started with empty machine squat sets of xkg i didnt do squats or proper leg days until years ago started with the bar overhead press deadlift got arrogant at kg and injured my lower back a while ago so for now im not deadlifting and i have to say i dont miss it at all i know my numbers are weak but i came from not being able to walk on this earth painfree i had doms from carrying a grocery bag home if somebody had told me that someday i would hold a kg dumbbell over my chest or kg on my back i would never have believed it i do not test rm because im scared of injury perhaps that is a mistake you tell me diet situation before i was an overweight person with very little food knowhow at the time i never really ate that bad but because i had a completely under working thyroid and i wasnt exercising at all the weight kept piling on i always skipped breakfast and mostly ate a sandwich at lunch and the biggest meal of the day in the evening i gained a lot of weight in my twenties as i was drinking my problems away which im not proud of when i started fitness i didnt know how to fuel my body properly in other words i knew jack shit about nutrition at the beginning i was the perfect moron eating salads and spending my time on the elliptical things i wish i knew before starting out my first year of cardio only i was severely undereating not tracking my calories once i did i notice that my estimation was wrong by calories overeating while bulking there is absolutely no point in gaining pounds in a couple of months of which are probably muscle and the rest fat a mistake i seem to repeat every time i bulk check out some befores and afters eating fat is necessary to live salt isnt the enemy neither are carbs what i do now i track everything in myfitnesspal when bulking ill eat about calories c f p cutting ill drop to calories mostly dropping carbs while maintaining high protein what i eat mostly my staple consists of oats eggs chicken fish pasta pasta is life for me greek yogurt olive oil avocadoes nuts fresh fruit vegetables and last but not least popcorn thanks greg my food is pretty much tasteless and boring but it works once a week i take my girl out to eat something good or we cook something special at home where im not counting here is a sample of what a day of eating looks like for me maintaining now boring yes but it works supplements whey isolate creatine only when bulking bcaas only during leg days for that placebo effect animal cuts at the end of a cut and vitamins all year round pwo on push pull days injury ill keep it short one advice i can give anyone do not get sloppy at the gym and rerack your weights between sets if you dont use them anymore i learned this the hard way and almost lost a

cejav9,Fitness,2019-07-17 21:40:28,how months changed my body tldr this sub helped me a lot by improving my overall knowledge and i would recommend anyone that is just starting to read the wiki as you will learn many things short introduction its been actually months now since ive been going to the gym of which ive been counting my calories and having a proper diet during this period i only skipped gym twice and those were only leg days in the first and a half months i followed the ice cream fitness icf routine which i think is the best thing for a beginner to follow during the first month i just learned the proper technique for all the compound movements as i started with an empty bar in almost all of them and i didnt count my calories from the beginning of i started counting my calories and cutting the fat while increasing my newbie strength although as many of you will say that i should have just started bulking i wanted to see some improvement first and also to begin the bulking phase with a lower body fat percentage after finishing with icf and the cutting phase i started bulking and i changed my routine to power hypertrophy upper lower phul which i followed until this week when i switched to power hypertrophy adaptive training phat every phase of my transformation will be broadly detailed further pics stats progress pictures sex male age years old when i started height cm weight as i weighted myself daily ill write the weekly average in order to prevent any confusion before i started cutting average is kg lbs once i finished cutting average is kg lbs where i am now average is kg lbs background right now i am doing a masters degree in cyber security engineering and before i never played any sport in particular i only used to play football but that was in high school years ago so i was basically a couch potato not including that i played world of warcraft also basically before i started going to the gym i never really cared what i ate meaning that i could stay until pm without eating because i was too lazy to cook anything and then because i was too hungry i would put a lasagna or pizza in the oven next before going to sleep i would eat a few more sandwiches and that would be all for a normaltypical day almost years ago now i had a similar attempt in which i started going to the gym but that only lasted for months before i got bored of eating only rice and chicken because thats what i thought i had to eat although i didnt stick to it it was a really good introduction into the fitness lifestyle and nutrition altogether as i learned a lot of things starting last december i was really motivated and i had a few goals in my mind one of them being that i really wanted to be more active and have a healthier lifestyle and another funny one was that i wanted to see my bicep veins one thing that stood in my mind the whole time was that i will not give up before reaching months into icf progress cutting to as you can see in the initial picture i was already going to the gym for like weeks and my muscles already got a toned appearance from the first day i started counting my calories with the myfitnesspal application and i kept a diary with my exercises it was a pretty harsh period as i was cutting and doing intermittent fasting and during the nights when i was really hungry i would stay at my computer and read or learn new recipes or things about exercises in the gym one thing that was really helpful and remained within my mind till now was whenever i had any lust for something sweet or unhealthy i would repeat the following stay consistent phrase that i learned from buff dudes on youtube from the exercise point of view during icf and cutting period i got my compound movements to the following levels im sorry but i never tried my rm in any of the exercises squats empty bar kg lbs for reps bench press kg kg lbs for reps barbell row empty bar kg lbs for reps deadlift kg kg lbs for reps overhead press empty bar kg lbs for reps as you may know in icfss you always increase your weight by kg lbs and overall squats and ohp were the exercises which really made me struggle with progressing but overall was a great experience and i got my abs to show and my bicep vein to pop as i always wanted from the nutrition point of view i used intermittent fasting hours interval without eating hours interval of eating and i started with eating around kcal carbs protein fat which i then lowered till at some point as i wasnt losing any more weight and i was doing high intensity interval training hiit around times a week in order to help with the deficit as at some point you should stop lowering your calories and increasing your cardio level i still drank alcohol like once per month once i hit my lowest week of under kg i was still thinking of lowering my body fat but that would interfere with my muscle i thought so i stopped and switched to a clean bulk bulking present i think i should start from the beginning with how my strength increase in the last and a half months but i still didnt try any of my rm so all i have to give you is my rm squats kg lbs kg lbs for reps front squats kg lbs for reps bench press kg lbs kg lbs for reps deadlift kg lbs kg lbs for reps overhead press kg lbs kg lbs for reps i feel like im still lacking strength in this exercise barbell row kg lbs kg lbs for reps phul is an incredible routine and a great follow up for icf as you have much more freedom with your number of repetitionssets during the bulk i started with around calories and right now i am eating around calories daily carbs protein fat i dont really have cheat meals unless i am on vacation and i dont really have any other choice overall diet i always try to keep my diet diversified and try new recipes or at least change the spices that i use in certain meals so i wont get bored heres a picture of what i had a few days ago picture and you can see that i usually have only one meal that contains meat and most of the times i eat oats twice a day but cooked differently as i love it so much and as it is the most micronutrient dense cereal the whole meal prep for that day took me minutes with washing the dishes afterwards i never surpass g of protein per kg and i try to keep my fats always in between g it might be hard sometimes having to cook and preparing so much food but in the end you will be thankful for everything that you put into your body supplements i drink a shake containing proteinamount is between g depending on my macros for the day glutamine g creatineg bcaag and i also take multivitamins whenever i feel like i didnt eat enough vegetables and micronutrients overall fish oil which i take daily and i started to take zinc magnesium about a week ago before going to bed conclusion overall i feel like this is the best period of my life thanks to how much i changed my lifestyle right now i will keep bulking as i just changed my routine to phat and i hope to increase my muscle mass and my overall strength right now i am not really sure until when i want to keep bulking but it will all depend on how i look but probably i will keep bulking till i get to around kg lbs but yeah this was my experience these last months and i hope i motivated some of you to start today as we only have one life and everyday counts further goals get my bench press to kg lbs before year of training and being able to do a single muscle up i will need to change my gym for this as i dont have enough space in my current one in order to even try it thank you and sorry for any written mistakes as english is not my first language if you have any questions ill be happy to answer them as id talk about this topic for days but i didnt want this post to get any longer than it already is edit thank you so much for all your support and positive feedback yesterday when i started writing i was thinking at some point about not posting it as i thought that people might not like what ill say and that ill just embarrass myself i see that many of you are asking for some more complex details regarding my nutrition plan as in what are some of my recipes and stuff for that i should make a whole other post as i need to write a lot about this topic ill be thinking about this and maybe ill write it over the weekend thanks again and stay consistent
4ct88b,Fitness,2016-04-01 01:36:38,obese to ripped in one year the why and how original post note i had a solid muscular base under my fat and a history of weight lifting this is why it looks like i gained a lot of muscle i didnt gain as much as you might think i mostly made what i had more visible before after pictures here is a picture of how jacked i already was my senior year of hs before i gained weight to prove that i had a solid muscular base and really didnt gain much muscle the spring break trip roughly one year ago i was invited to a spring break trip to panama city beach fl i had a great time but i felt held back i really started to see just how bad my lack of confidence was i wanted to take my shirt off and enjoy the sun but i really didnt want people to see how i looked coincidentally during the trip i found this article by uzbyhnev which outlined the difference between motivation and discipline the article mentioned this is one of these situations where adopting a different perspective immediately results in superior outcomes it really was immediately when i got back i told myself that i was going to lose weight and get ripped for my next spring break trip i didnt care what it took i wanted it so i was going to have it the plan i knew the basic idea behind losing weight was to eat less than you could consume so i went off of that idea i looked up a weight loss calculator on google and stumbled upon this one i plugged in my stats to lose two pounds a week and got my caloric target the beginning in the beginning i really didnt workout or anything i just tracked my calories at some point i started using myfitnesspal to track my calories but i did it on paper to start off i ate what i was used to eating just less i ate portioned out tuna casseroles bagels with cream cheese noodles with pasta sauce and a whole bunch of other typical american food i lost a decent bit of fat just by doing that and i felt great because i was gaining solid momentum at a certain point i made a bet on a site called healthywage which pays you to lose weight i knew confidently that i was going to follow through so it was a nobrainer needless to say i doubled my money gaining momentum while losing weight i did lots of research and learned a lot i read a lot of articles and watched a lot of fitness youtubers i think its important to be a sponge for information learning while going through the process was crucial in getting the results i attained i was learning about refeed days strict bodybuilding diets supplementing creatine advanced calorie counting techniques and weighing food on a scale before i did any of those things a couple of months into my journey i finally joined the gym hitting the gym note i lifted before i got fat so i had some sense in what i was doing when i started youtubers i liked at the time were the buff dudes so i modeled my workouts after their day split routine later i read about the concepts behind the strong lifts x program and combined that with the concept of a three day split heres the kicker i didnt really have a set list of exercises that i would do in a certain order when i went to the gym i would always wing it these are the only rules i really followed when entering the gym get around reps on most compound exercises focus only on the particular body parts for the given day chesttriceps backbiceps legsshoulders focus most of my effort on compound exercises for chesttricep days i would do flat dumbbell chest presses and the good ol fashioned bench press for many sets of reps sometimes i would do things like incline barbell presses and incline dumbbell presses etc as soon as i noticed i was repeating the same routine multiple times i switched it up i would change the ordering of each exercise the number of sets the amount of weight along with shorterlonger rest periods incorporation of drop sets etc there was one day where all i did was bench press for sets and kept dropping the weight until became unbearable i feel that it is too easy to get bored with the same routine so i mixed it up i enjoy the process of choosing what to do in the moment given what equipment is available and what im feeling needless to say i confused the hell out of muscles doing this which is a good thing i got addicted to going to the gym i loved feeling the pump where my muscles would fill with blood feel tight and look huge since i was cutting for a while though i gained very little strength which was slightly discouraging however there was a point in time where i started to supplement with creatine g daily and felt like a gym god in about weeks my deadlift went from to and i remember being so happy when i finally pulled plates ill also add that i did some running on the treadmill about times a week for minutes after my lifting sessions as you can see extreme cardio was not a significant part of my weight loss a caloric deficit with some weightlifting and persistence was the key improving my diet as i kept reading and watching youtube videos i learned better ways to eat and prepare food first of all i only drank water plain tea or black coffee drinking only watercoffeetea was never a problem for me but i know it is for others so i thought id mention it i learned techniques for preparing my meals ahead of time and routinely eating those rmealprepsunday i planned the meals to be anywhere from calories they tended to consist of a lean meat a filling carbohydrate and steamed vegetables i also ate plain oatmeal for breakfast with some chopped up fruit andor peanutbutter and cinnamon i also drank fruit smoothies and prepared overnight oats by now i had purchased a food scale and a body fat caliper to chart changes in my body fat percentage and measure my calories with greater precision i started eating very clean i did have days where i would have slices of pizza and other junk but i stuck with my diet of the time proteins chicken breast turkey fish carbohydrates brown rice quinoa potatoes sweet potatoes vegetables broccoli carrots cauliflower green beans getting ripped losing fat became very hard at the end my fat loss started to plateau my goal was to get to body fat and at the time i had around previously i had read about refeed days and diet breaks and decided to give these techniques a try i figured my body needed it considering that i had been at a caloric deficit for many months the day diet break i had was amazing energy levels went through the roof which translated to slightly better lifts in the gym after the break was over i lost a couple more pounds of fat a little bit easier with the iconic spring break trip soon approaching i had to lose another pounds in about weeks i slightly lowered my calories from around to and continued to hit the gym days a week with occasional cardio it was very difficult i had ridiculous cravings ridiculous i started obsessing about the next time i was going to eat and my roommate had to deal with my shitty mood swings i had about two planned refeed days within that week period and those were the days i looked forward too in the end it came down to discipline in not eating and sticking to my plan regardless of how i felt conclusion the day before spring break i had a new average weighin lb on the dot tldr i was fat and didnt like it learned discipline motivation started calorie counting started hitting the gym and lifting weights with a caloric deficit started eating cleaner got hard near the end so i incorporated diet breaks and refeeds fought huge cravings and eventually hit body fat edit thanks for gold common questions how tall are you what weight did you start and end at lb lb what were your starting and ending lifts startingin deficit mode x squat x deadlift x bench endingalso in deficit mode x squat x deadlift x bench how do you feel about your loose skindo you have loose skin i do have some loose skin on the bottom of my stomach but luckily it isnt very bad i feel that my decent genetics a good diet drinking plenty of water and losing fat at a reasonable pace all helped minimize the damage if you want to lose weight i can assure you that i feel a lot better with a little loss skin than i did when i was fat the loose skin does get a little tighter over time

3fglgl,Fitness,2015-08-02 00:18:57,nearly year transformation m to so ive been a lurker on reddit for a while now and this is a subreddit that i love to frequent especially when i come across transformation threads for a while now ive been considering doing the same but i had been terrified of doing so as most are when they used to be incredibly overweight im selfconscious when it comes to my body image i used to be an overweight slob which was brought on by binge eating because of my depression during my teen years and which i still deal with today back then i would eat to the point until i felt my heart begin to tighten in my chest and while it was terrifying there was a part of me that wished to go album sorry im new to reddit i started to turn things around when my grandmother passed away i cut out all the sweets sodas and juices my body went through a massive withdrawal phase but i bit down and marched through it i didnt have money for a gym at the time but there was a nearby track that i could reach nearby it was there where i started to walk and barely jog for a few seconds eventually those few seconds before a minute and then a few minutes that jog became a gradual run that run became the miles i would run every day i started to add some body weight exercises to my runs too but mostly i prided myself in my endurance and was content to keep it that way at that point i weighed at my lightest of lbs unfortunately despite being able to see my abs finally i had to deal with quite a bit of loose skin around my waist it was a constant reminder of how i had messed up that i had gone too far there was a part of me that wanted to give up i started to ramp up my exercises but to no avail i couldnt rebound from it around this time my father became ill with cancer and between school helping to take care of him i started to taper off from working out as often then he passed on july st of unsure of what to do i found peace in lifting my older brother introduced me to power lifting and finding some youtubers online definitely helped guide me along however it was slow going for someone that barely had any strength going from a mindset of run run run to lifting primarily i loved it though during this time i found better work and started to save having started to research what i could do with my extra skin traveling for some consultations took time but it was worth it in the end when i found a surgeon that not only cared but had a great portfolio i was terrified of the surgery as it was my first ever but i went in figuring that anything was better than what i had coming out of it i was in no pain at all lifting had helped to tighten my abdominals so i didnt need to have them reset which is where the majority of the pain comes from i now have a degree scar around my waist and it took me roughly and a half weeks to walk around normally instead of the hunch back i had to be the surgery took place in late february of this year and i can share more pictures of this if you guys want anyway now here i am at in the middle of a cut while i still deal with depression im much happier and slowly trying to get used to the idea of intimacy i have a lot of stretch marks so im crazy selfconscious about it as for why i decided to post this all its because i know that there may be others out there like me i want them to know that its not impossible to turn things around that its not too late to have a better healthy life if theres at least one person out there that turns it around because of this then i am happy edit to add a tldr i

31gzxe,Fitness,2015-04-05 00:12:27,progress female years old to pounds in months some nsfw and loose skin pics first off i want to say thanks to all of you who have overcome the nerves to post pictures and progress posts all of the information on here has been great but seeing people help others by posting has given me the courage to do the same there are really two stories within this post for most of my life i have been over pounds i actually just found some old pictures mainly what made me feel the need to post for others who might be scared where i was my heaviest these are from my trip to san fran in and these are from dont really know what weight im at but im guessing around as i had logged it in myfitnesspal that year i had horrible eating habits and was mostly eating once or twice a day due to stress and having a horrible schedule of jobs and school i tried for a little bit to log my food but never stuck to it over the next few years my weight would go up and down but when i started working out last year i was august i really have no explanation as to why i started working out i think it was just a challenge to myself or just get rid of extra energy but once i started i never and still havent stopped i logged my food and weight on myfitnesspal from day one but of course fell into the trap of it telling me what my goals should be so my goal was calories a day and i started walking on the treadmill for about an hour a day days a week i religiously weigh and track my food i had always loved healthy food so it wasnt a huge transition for me and going to culinary school helped me create healthy meals i didnt have any clue about my macros for the first few months so all i did was focus on just eating calories from looking back in myfitnesspal i could tell that my carbs were super high and was most likely the reason i could run and walk as much as i did september started doing faster walking on the treadmill and incorporated wii dancing as well into my days i had a full time job with odd hours so i would workout at different times but still made it a habit to get on that treadmill for at least minutes saturday through thursday october i eventually wanted to see if i could actually run on the treadmill and slowly started increasing my speed i sort of set a goal to get to and was well on my way november halloween unfortunately i didnt keep up with the monthly progress pics but took enough bathroom pictures to keep track lol mid november i hit my goal of but of course i wasnt happy and set a new goal of getting to by christmas by then i was well immersed in the fitness subreddit and was addicted to finding out as much info as i could i told myself that if i could get to i would start lifting weights and ease up on the cardio december dont have any pictures of november through december but at this point im running every day for half of the workout time by christmas i had hit my goal of and had already begun researching what i wanted to do in the form of lifting of course with all the success i had been having with cardio i didnt want to get rid of it entirely so i did a bit of it before and after my workouts i was still eating only calories januaryfebruary i knew from reading more information that eating calories probably wasnt the best thing to do i was going through some emotional things during this month and lost my job so eating was all over the place i jumped back up to but by the end of january i was back down to throughout januray and february i was all over the place with diet as for a whole month i stayed low carb high carb low protein high proteini was so focused on my weight going down that i just tried everything week to week i would increase my calories one week and a little bit of weight would come off then come back on i had no energy on the low carb diet and noticed that for the previous months it had been high and i was still losing weight so i increased them so beginning of feb i had this as my macros which wasnt working at all since i stalled for a month so increased the calories even more to c f p i eventually lost more pounds i found jefit and started doing a small weight lifting routine through it i only had dumbells and a proform home gym so i incorporated some random exercises here and there as i had no idea what i was doingmy treadmill eventually broke so i eventually just had a stationary bike to work with i was still scared to leave cardio out of the equation as now the weight was coming off more slowly i officially hit midway through february and was ecstatic marchtoday hovering around my weight wasis constantly going up and down a few pounds i was so used to the weight falling off that i started freaking out and over analyzing everything by the end of february the lowest i had gone was but it continues to go up and down i eventually got rid of all the cardio and started a tighter lifting regime which you can see here this is me today currently and still have some loose skin on my belly i didnt photoshop any of these pictures as i wanted to show what it looks like to still have stretch marks im still a work in progress and still learning every day from things you guys post on here so please keep it up diet the first three months was semiclean eating with lots of chicken salads and veggies i still had a cheat day on fridays my only off day where i would eat a little bit over the calorie limit before xmas i had been reading about the importance of protein intake and with my new lifting mindset i set my goal pretty high g due to my weight at the time and was able to meet it pretty easily since i received a huge bag of whey for xmas other than that i filled it in with eggs chicken beans and cottage cheese or yogurt my carbs were either fruit veggies broccoli cauliflower brussel sprouts or brown rice i love spinach and still eat at least a bag of it a week like ive said i overanalyze everything so im still tweaking my macros since im focusing on heavier weights now i love avocados and that is my main fat source other than egg yolks and nuts i still have pizza every now and then and try to fill my sweet tooths with

this has helped me see that but i still love critiques and any help with this is welcome i know all about iifym and keep psyching myself out on which is the best way to go since all im doing now are weights like ive said my weight has been going up and down pounds for about a month now so im kind of stuck on what to do im currently eating this to see if increasing my cals again will help me lose fat while lifting i really want to get rid of my little belly and wondering if you all agree that its just extra skin going forward i hope to lower my body fat and work on building some muscle any critiques on my workout regime are welcome as well like ive said i am a work in progress and all your comments are greatly appreciated thanks again guys for hearing my rant tldr before still a work in

process show those who are stuck that it can be accomplished i will definitely keep posting i think im going to start tinkering with bodyweight fitness as i dont want to teach myself bad habits with

58dps9,Fitness,2016-10-20 00:01:28,i hit a lb bench pr in competition yo and lbs on the road to be the youngest to bench i recently competed in a powerlifting competition which took place in tuscaloosa alabama where i benched lbs which is now the current american bench record for my age all weight classes i have been competing for years and got into powerlifting as an outlet to deal with adversities in life my goal is to be the youngest person to bench press lbs in competition i hope to accomplish this goal within the next to months heres the video of the bench my current training protocol is an week bench program that requires two bench days a week one heavy and one light the regimen can be compared to a linear progression where you add lbs every week to the heavy day this program has increased my bench lbs in months from lbs to lbs i plan to continue using this program in order to bench press lbs a quick summary of the program would be the following the first week of training starts starts with a heavy day this day is considered to be a day where the weight being used is more taxing on the body than a typical training day at of your current rep max the most weight you can lift for one repetition for sets of repetitions the first light day this day is a day where the weight being used is not very taxing on the body and allows you to focus more on the technique of the lift also starts at of your current rep max for sets of repetitions as you see the first week of the program requires both days to use the same weight but this changes week by week because each week the weight increases only on the heavy day by lbs depending on how easy the previous week was continue this training for weeks after the th week decrease the weight to of current rep max the subsquent week try maxing out my diet my diet is not the healthiest diet but i make sure to consume at least grams of protein a day by way of protein powder and high protein foods steak chicken fish sometimes i will allow myself a really big meal such as twelve tacos or a huge plate of cajun french fries the way my school schedule is and training schedule i am only able to eat twice a day once after school and once after training but i make these meals count by eating a sufficient amount of calories to sustain high energy levels for example a typical meal before the gym for me would be two grilled chicken sandwiches with a bottle of gatorade or fruit punch benching lbs was a huge pr for me but i see it as a milestone and now a lbs is the next goal for me to achieve currently the youngest person to bench lbs in competition is josh bryant the creator of jailhouse strong he was years old and months weighing at i have until december to beat his record and i plan on weighing no more than pounds thanks for watching my video and reading my post please ask me any questions if you have them and ill be glad to answer

49e66z,Fitness,2016-03-07 19:04:52,resting longer between sets could help you build bigger stronger muscles according to recent research in the journal of strength and conditioning research in the study two groups of experienced lifters did the same workout three times a week for eight weeks it was a typical bodybuilding regimen back squats leg presses leg extensions bench presses shoulder presses lat pulldowns and cable rows each workout they did three sets of eight to twelve reps of each exercise lifting to failure the only difference between the two groups one rested for one minute between sets and the other rested for three minutes after eight weeks the researchers used ultrasound imaging to measure the lifters muscle growth the men who had rested longer had more growth in all the muscles tested the biceps triceps and quads were not talking about monster gains the longerresting group grew an extra to millimeters in each muscle but those millimeters come from such an easy tweak that few guys who are trying to bulk would turn them down the researchers also tested the subjects strength gains by determining their onerep max in the bench press and back squat the longer resters won this contest too they increased their onerep max for the squat by percent and for the bench by percent thats compared to the oneminute rest group which increased its maxes by percent and percent respectively thats big if you can bench pounds a lifting regimen with longer rests could help you increase that to pounds in eight weeks resting for only minute between sets on the other hand could hold you back to only pounds why the difference the researchers think that a longer rest period allows you to recover more fully between sets which may enable you to lift heavier weights in your next set says lead study author brad schoenfeld phd those heavier weights put more tension on your muscles which may lead to bigger gains in both strength and size consider working longer rests into your routine if you want to build strength and size says schoenfeld this study only compared oneminute and threeminute rests but other research suggests that two minutes may be enough to fully recover between sets he says take those twominute rests after your major compound exercises like squats presses and rows which are more physically taxing and take longer to recover from but you can stick to shorter second rests for singlejoint movements like biceps curls which youll bounce back from more quickly text from this article from mens health by ali eaves

8rtgw8,Fitness,2018-06-17 19:42:40,m textbook skinnyfat progress lbs to lbs edit title says but needs to be ok this blew up more than expected i already replied to some but i have to go now ill try to reply to everyone when i get back home nbsp hi all im making this post because i want to show what rfitness has done for me and that even the worst cases of skinnyfatness are curable there are undoubtedly more impressive progress posts out there but when i searched to find stories like mine to find inspiration to keep me going i found none thats why i wanted to write it all down so that other true skinnyfat people can see that you can actually shake it off not literally although you could probably lose it by dancing too nbsp background tldr mlbs mkg mlbs mkg i know the dates say that it took years but it actually didnt its just the time in between the first and current picture i just cruised for months after my first cut wasnt really a cut more on that later because i was pretty content all in all it took a bit over year nbsp pictures every picture is taken right after waking up no pump and no food i was fat at lbskg no picture then skinnyfat at lbskg then skinny at lbskg bulked up to lbskg and cut back down to lbskg originally i had goals lose the tits lose the love handles and get abs i have mild gyno so ill probably never completely lose the moobs and all my fat goes to my lower back and lower abs so i probably wont lose my love handles until i am sub body fat the gyno and lower back fat are not really visible in the pictures long live the nipple twist and loose fitting underwear but theyre still there although theyre maybe of their original size this is not my endstation but im happy with my progress nbsp full story edit holy fuck this turned out longer than i wanted theres no vital info or tips in here just my story so you dont have to read this unless youre actually interested scroll down to lift progress if you arent nbsp intro i warned you for the majority of my life yo onwards i have always been the fat kid at around years old standing at roughly lbs kg i had enough over the course of years and a bit of yoyoing i dropped down to lbs kg i hung around that weight for another year but still wasnt anywhere near a body i could be happy with i was unhappy and bordering on depression im pretty pear shaped small shoulders small lats wide and high hips combined with a smaller waist heavy legs as a matter of fact i think i was supposed to be a pear and got changed to be a human at the last second before being put on earth being skinnyfat didnt help then one summer i went to a place with lots of fit and attractive people thats when i had enough again i thought if all these people can be fit i can be fit too it was the proverbial drop in the bucket and finally mustered up the courage to start the road for lack of a better word to curing my skinnyfatness paired with general unhappiness i knew rfitness existed but i never visited it this changed and i started reading more and more abusing the subs search function eventually i stumbled onto the the wiki which contained all the info i needed and off i went nbsp cut not really a cut start july there were options cut recomp or bulk recomping was out of the question pretty fast because it is pretty slow and i feared that that me being new to all this i would likely just be spinning my wheels i didnt want to bulk either because id only get fatter so i started a cut it was diet cardio and lifting so not really a cut and more a dieting down to be honest i didnt want to fork out the money for a gym membership and due to previous experiences the gym wasnt appealing to me i just did a little routine at home x per week more on that in lift progress at this point i havent heard about myfitnesspal so i made my own spreadsheet and database these are just snippets i used this during the entirety of my cut im just going to call it cut from now on because its easier i officially started the th of july and took a month break from mid october until mid november then i picked it up again until th of december end nbsp contently cruising new year rolled around and by the time i was pretty happy with where i was still living the pearlife but i had abs for the first time in my life this continued until around july coincidentally right around the same event that got me started the year before when i noticed that in my mind the youre skinny comments stopped registering as compliments and more and more as youre too skinny so i decided id like to have some more muscle on me i also started to feel too weak literally its really confronting when you come to the conclusion youre not the fatbutstrong guy any more because youre not fat any more nbsp bulk the wild ride start july bulk it cant be that hard just eat above your tdee and gain no more than lbs per month lets do this with myfitnesspal this time fuck me sideways i was wrong the first month and a half i went up lbs i could not figure out what was happening i was eating what i was supposed to be eating and tracking correctly crosschecked mfp with my own spreadsheet then all of the sudden the weight gained stopped not tapered down just flat out stopped i still dont know what the fuck happened could it be water retention from eating at such a low intake before and just more food in my stomach and bowels but i looked about the same so no big deal i just continued i also play sports so due to the variations in the amount of traininggames and intensity of said traininggames it was very hard to consistently gain about lbs per month some months i gained lbs some months i gained lbs i retained some outline of my abs while increasing strength so i wasnt too worried the highest number i saw on my scale was lbs kg but the trend only gave lbs kg so im rolling with that as official end weight end nbsp cut a proper cut march i graduated and got a job an active one months until summer and an active job so no better time than then to start cutting lowered my intake gradually over the course of months while taking a week break in the middle people here often say bulk until you hate yourself cut until you hate life i always thought the phrase was just for a laugh and because its catchy but i now realise it really isnt i could lose a bit more fat especially lower abs and lower back but im absolutely done for now i think im a bit leaner than when i was lbskg and hovering around body fat end nbsp lift progress i know im still nowhere near strong but i think i made some pretty good progress so far all lifts stayed the same during my cut up until last week squat start lbs x kg x current lbs x kg x bench press start lbs x kg x current lbs x kg x deadlift start lbs x kg x current lbs x kg x overhead press start lbs x kg x current lbs x kg x nbsp during the first cut i did a stupid little selfmade routine because i didnt want to go to a gym it basically consisted of x decline situps x minute elbow planks normal and side x ez bar curls x tricep pushdowns and sometimes x db rows if i felt like it i didnt do any lifting during my cruising period when i decided i wanted to go to the gym and bulk i had a lot of time so i wanted a routine that made use of that i also wanted a routine with lots of shoulder and chest work and i didnt want to go more than days per week to the gym i also read you should train in different rep ranges and you need both vertical and horizontal pulling after a bit of reading a searching around i picked lvysaurs and i didnt regret it for a single moment bench and ohp everyday varying rep ranges highrep deadlifts chinups it fit all the requirements i still dont get why it doesnt get mentioned more the only thing i did was add some core work and face pulls lat raises alternating every gymday and dialed back the progression a bit in the end around mid december i switched to bbb because i felt my linear gains were starting to run out in hindsight it might have been because i didnt eat enough and i was ready to commit to days per week did a couple of cycles until i started my cut in march when i started my cut i tried continuing bbb but ended after cycle i switched to gzcl the rippler but while its a perfectly fine program i didnt really like it it took around the same time as bbb maybe even a bit longer but i felt i was doing less also i dont like the very low rep sets reps per set i ended up switching to triumviratefsl which i am still doing now nbsp diet food im convinced i have a slowerthanaverage metabolism during my first cut i averaged around kcal and lost about lbs kg per week i did at least x per week cardio x hiit training game kcal is very low for a lbs male but such is life during my bulk i started at kcal while blowing up lbs didnt know what the fuck i had to do so i dialled it back to kcal but kept on gaining like a i was getting ready for hibernation when i finally stopped gaining i gradually upped my intake every couple of weeks and ended up around kcal i gained a little bit too fast for my liking at kcal to i dialled it back a bit to kcal i started my second cut back at kcal but i wasnt losing any weight nor was i gaining nothing nothing again no fucking clue why it didnt budge i wasnt gaining at earlier not im not losing at blows my mind anyway i gradually reduced until i started seeing the scale move this started at around kcal and now im at kcal im now at a point where its mentally very hard and im struggling to get myself to the gym let alone performing decently which is a red flag for me im ending it here nbsp macros g protein g fat i often dont make this number its closer to rest are carbs classic iifym diet chicken swedish quark dark bread rice potatoes and eggs are my staple foods i eat the same things almost everyday because its easy and i dont mind nbsp supplements zinc vit d and magnesium because they all showed up to be defeicient or on the low side according to my blood tests no creatine or protein shakes no creatine because i didnt feel like i needed it and because of the supposed links with male pattern baldness rather be safe than sorry and no protein shakes because i get sufficient protein from food edit added macros and suplements nbsp optional future goals im not where i want to end yet but im happy with my progress so far i could still lose a couple of pounds of fat but id rather gain a bit more muscle strength first i think im gonna do week bulk the length of cycles week cut cycles and see how it goes also im going to switch back to bbb still focussing on lats and shoulders because theyre still my weak point fucking genetics man nbsp in conclusion id like to say the following rfitness is often criticized mainly by rfitness itself but i dont think you lot realise especially the ones that are very active how much you can change peoples lives mine for example so much actual knowledge bunched up in this subreddit

i did it for any newcomers to this subreddit i really hope that this helps someone if it helps anyone at all it will have been worth the effort of typing this long spiel for most of my life i have suffered from depression and anxiety even from the age of i can remember being depressed i had been on a variety of antidepressants and i never really liked how they made me feel im sure if i stuck with them i could have found one that worked for me but i just didnt like them so decided to live without a little over years ago i ended up going to therapy as my depression was affecting my relationships in a very negative way i expressed that i really didnt want to go on antidepressants or anything again and my therapist kept recommending exercising to me insisting that i join a gym it took me like or more sessions to finally listen to her and joined a gym only to prove to her that she was wrong and it wouldnt help i absolutely hated it at first everything about it i had terrible anxiety anytime i would walk in the door i hated the million mirrors everywhere i felt like everyone was judging me for obviously having no idea what i was doing i kept at it though in order to prove my therapist wrong eventually i started to not hate it and then surprisingly i noticed i actually looked forward to going to the gym a little over three years later and here i am i went from severely depressed doing literally nothing ever i would wake up minutes before work come home and sit on the couch for hours only to sleep another hours and then repeat my diet consisted of fast food and junk food no wonder i felt like shit all the time now i wake up at am every day go to yoga go to work go to the gym come home and make a healthy dinner hang out with my soontobe husbandanimals and go to bed my physical progress stomach back arms nutrition i basically eat the same things every day mainly out of laziness and a hatred for cooking i know there are tons of options out there for a healthyfit lifestyle i am just far too lazy to make any of them and im a shit cook as well so i keep it very simple breakfast eggs cup of egg whites scrambled with butter to grease the pan cup of coffee with full fat full sugar cream because its something i just dont want to cut out snack g plain greek yogurt mixed with a handful of blended frozen strawberries and a banana lunch turkey

my workout lately i havent done much cardio though cause i had bronchitis and never got back into it but i will be starting that again so i can have better endurance for my longer hikes when i first started out i did a full body routine x a week i recommend that for beginners as if you start out with what im doing currently you will likely hate it and not want to go back i love lifting because i love setting and breaking prs i love feeling strong and i love the way it makes me feel and look i realize now that no one was judging me when i first went to the gym i do not judge anyone that goes there whether they are new or not i respect everyone in there for making an effort to better themselves physically and mentally some days it is still a struggle to go especially when im having an off day and feel the depression trying to take hold of me again its on those days that you need to exercise the most anyway if anyone reads this thank you it was a loong post and i appreciate you for

hopes of letting people know that theyre not alone even though were in a hyperconnected digital age where everything is either available at our fingertips online through the mail or at a quick jaunt to the local store were for the most part more alone than ever when you couple that with a complete lack of nutrition in the foods were sold as healthy and the food pyramid foisted upon us by our well intentioned but kneejerk government food nannies well we end up with a whole lot of little pods floating around lost nutritionally like i was feeling lost and alone not sure what to do and how to start the journey back to health a brief timeline this is me when i started the journey edited to add another picture that my daughter contributed from mothers day what a sad photo mothers day lbs in april of lbs lost in months april th i had strep throat and went to the dr for a prescription their scale read lbs and i was devastated as long as i avoided actually confronting the numbers on the scale i could ignore how heavy i was sort of i was sick all the time and getting dizzy and generally feeling horrible i decided to cut out soda with sugar mothers day may th my sister is a type diabetic and i asked her to check my blood sugar readings after dinner hers was and mine was thats not good in fact thats the type of number which indicates organ damage if left untreated may th the day after mothers day i asked my doctor to run a fasting glucose test and it came back at which is really bad his reaction was you win i told you to cut sugar and lose weight you didnt so you win the prize type diabetes i love my doctor hes a smartass like me no really i do good guy they put me on the big metformin lisinopril simvastatin now im an adult right im on lifetime medicines for a disease yay not but cutting out the sugar in my soda i had lost lbs hmmmm so cutting sugar helps me lose weight without doing anything else ive already jacked up my pancreas and wont be using insulin to get rid of sugar the normal way so lets just avoid sugar all together august they run this test to check your average blood sugar levels called the ac which tells them how much sugar was left floating around inside your bloodstream after the insulin did its job i had quit eating all forms of simple starches no sugar no bread or tortillas no pasta no rice no potatoes no simple starches at all tons of veggies broccoli cauliflower green beans carrots yes they have a little sugar but theyre good for you hush veggies veggies veggies and meat lean and not lean meat meat meat i did make a conscious choice to avoid eating bacon and fatty meats often i wasnt shooting for a atkins high level ketosis state i was shooting for a state where my body didnt have easy to store carbs i didnt count calories and just ate when hungry i portioned out meat oz of chicken or beef cubes frozen in small tupperware containers and added them to veggies with sriracha and soy sauce and whatever else caught my fancy usually parmesan cheese or a little cheddar and i walked on a treadmill at the gym x a week for min each time and the weight fell off id lost lbs and was down to and my ac of indicated my average bs was over the past months now thats still a tad high for a normal person if you use conservative measures of blood sugar and im eating no carbs at all but its safe november they checked my ac again and its still at bs ac range and im down to lbs another lbs lost theyre taking me off all of my meds and the issues i have with my back are going away now that my weight is down i can finally walk with less pain and my limp from the stenosis in my back is going away i join a gym feb ive been at lbs for the past months but ive lost inches of fat off my chest and lost multiple inches off my waist and belly ive been lifting as heavy as possible to build muscle i would like ideally to make this last part of the conversion a plateau before a fast drop but the plateau will be a fat burning and muscle building plateau its a long process im and not so the skin doesnt have elasticity it once did after i get down to a good weight ill have surgery to remove some skin which is not not not pretty so i wont be sharing any body pictures in my undies sorry ladies and gents whore into that type of thing but i do have a picture from a few days ago freshly shaved head and full body picture from about a

5lioa6,Fitness,2017-01-02 02:02:39,m lbs weight loss tldwtr after many set backs restarts injuries etc i finally reached a total weight loss of lbs this morning dont confuse that ive lost lbs i weigh all diet and exercise no thermo pills no surgery etc its awesome but the loose skin sucks pics for the impatient each is annotated for clarity story when i was a kid i was told i would never be fat my mom even had trouble finding pants that could fit me properly but just before puberty i began to gain weight by the time i graduated from high school i was lbs started college and gain an additional lbs within the first years when i was i was rushed to the er from work with severe chest pains and shortness of breath the initial thought was heart attack but luckily it was a massive panic attack nevertheless i was put on blood pressure meds and told to lose weight of course i didnt do that my junior year of college i moved to main campus weighing about and reached by end of the st year on campus second year of on campus i moved with friends from back home this was when i reached my max of lbs it is very possible that i weighed more but the figure is the highest i found logged by a medical office so it is the one i use anyway one night my friends invited me to the gym and to this day i am quite sure they were only being nice to the fat guyfriend but for some reason i went i picked a recumbent cycle and went about minutes for a distance of about miles i remember distinctly thinking that i must not have been as out of shape as i thought i was the next morning i woke up at am to get ready for my am psych class to this day it is hte only class i ever missed for something like this i literally could not walk my legs felt heavy and radiated pain into my pelvis every time i moved it was a good half hour before i was finally able to hobble done to the bathroom to pee i was years old and if someone on the floor had access to a walker i would have used it without question what happened next is hard to explain i dont really even understand it myself my legs continued to feel better and i felt there was something that had changed in me the idea that i did this to myself but knowing that when it was better it would never be this bad again two days later i went back i was once again sore but this time i could walk times a week that first month netted me a lbs loss it was enough to be my catalyst for change so i kept going at the end of the first year i had lost lbs that was lbs i would never gain back as i continued to lose i got very sick and no one could tell me what was wrong i was terrified it was undiagnosed cancer or something worse finally at years old a nurse practitioner successfully diagnosed gall stones which has been previously ruled out by a hida scan a week after the surgeons consult i was in surgery i had primary gallstones all of them larger than with the largest being just over an inch in diameter these are apparently common in people losing a lot of weight the ordeal had set me back about lbs a year after that i was down a total of lbs when i severely screwed my back up laying hardwood unfortunately this is not a double entendre it was hardwood flooring and i was basically in the bed for weeks followed by physical therapy for another months after an mri it was discovered this was my obesity coming back to haunt me i had a lateral bulged disc at l with moderate foraminal stenosis causing a lot of pain down my left side but no central stenosis so that was good with pt this resided and i have been on a strict core workout regimen to keep myself pain free this time i had gained almost lbs back for the years after that i yoyoed pretty regularly as is the custom of most previously obese people mostly i stayed between lbs and lbs i knew how to drop weight but hadnt yet learned how to properly change my lifestyle to the point where i could keep it off but it would come in time fast forward to now i am years old i have surrounded myself with friends who are active and supportive they understand the struggle i have been through and refuse to let me fail i have finally trained my family to not throw out the but youre skinny you can have a couple bites or the grandma favorite youre getting too skinny you need to stop losing weight these things combined has helped finally move my head into the mental space where it needs to be to be successful on a longterm basis i also think switching to the concept of getting better lifting looking better etc versus weigh less helped a lot too the scale is a good tool but if you start lifting and you arent obese it is a poor indicator of your overall success thirteen weeks ago i hurt my shoulder it is the first upper body injury i have had in my life before the aforementioned mental shift i would have rested and recovered but not now as such i merely changed my habits to accommodate this injury i talked to my doctors and physical therapist to develop a short term program where i can workout but with minimal shoulder involvement i work legs times a week and cardio the other usually a stairclimber for minutes leg exercises avoid loading the shoulderstraps with significant amounts of weight the doctors assure me that ill be back to lifting soon diet i have basically been on all of the options at some point lowfat is where i started then moved to highprotein for a stretch after about a year of yoyo dieting i adhered to a strict ketogenic diet for nearly years i cut about lbs off on keto not much for years but i lost it and kept it off for the last months i have switched to a iifym style of eating which is in my humble opinion the best out of the various options i eat roughly calories a day when actively lifting and trying to put on muscle during cuts i drop to a crazy but effective calorieday diet that is heavy on protein to help maintain lean mass protein always stays at or above gday i think due to my history of dieting and focusing so much on weight loss i need the ultra low calories to be effective in dropping fat day doesnt seem to help me drop weight when i move back to a lifting caloric load i have to do it slowly over a few weeks otherwise i get really sick to my stomach and seem to pack on fat quick exercise my approach to fitness is functional with a heavy slant on looking decent so i guess i want to just look like the classic male im not in the gym to impress or break records other than my own due to some former fattie issues i cant really deadlift so i rack pull and dumbell romanian dl instead i can squat but im still working on form for bb squat so i do a heavy amount of db goblet squats as for bench i prefer incline over flat and as i mentioned earlier before the injury my pr was sets of at lbs when lifting i run a day split monday is chesttricep tuesday is corelegs weds is backbicep thursday is auxcardio friday is shoulders sat is legs as i said previously i like the stairmaster for cardio but i also jog and use the spin bikes at the gym currently due to my injury i do legs on monday cardiocore on tuesday legslight chest on weds cardio on thursday light all overcardio on friday legs on sat i also hike when i can with a light pack to prevent loading my shoulder too much tech i have religiously worn a polar m for the last years hours a day days a week only taking it off for the few hours needed to recharge it every weeks or so i love it and it serves well as a motivator and it reminds me to get up and move fyi i like to remind people that if you use some sort of tracker tech remember to update the weight it uses for calorie calculations as you lose to make sure youre getting as accurate a count as possible aftermath i honestly dont know how to feel about it part of me wants to shout it from the rooftops part wants to cry in a corner in happiness and the other part of me says ok whats next the biggest downside to the loss is the massive amount of loose skin i have remaining i probably need to drop about more pounds at the most and the thought of more skin disgusts me to have come this far and still not be comfortable taking off your shirt at the beach or even in the locker room kind of sucks unfortunately there isnt anything that is going to fix it for me but surgery most of mine is covered in scar tissue left over from the many many stretch marks i developed much of the scar tissue has faded but it doesnt magically revert to skin as an example under my arms from the armpit to down on my torso it literally looks like ive been burned ive been told by doctors there isnt anything they can do for that other than remove parts of it and tighten it up but those parts arent really saggy enough to have removed i can always put muscle on under it but around my abdomen i will never have a v taper much less visible abs without having the skin removed then naturally the docs follow it up with the sticker shock of or more also the fact it is a very very painful procedure that possibly will result in small numb patches of skin around my lower torso cest la vie i suppose faqs stuff im just going to go ahead and answer now to save responding later because people always ask the same stuff did you use surgery or chemicals no no gastric bypass or lap bands no thermogenics appetite suppressants or stimulants aside from caffeine in fact i only tried prework for the first time about months ago sheer strength in cotton candy flavor is by far my favorite and gives me the best results of the ones i have tried is your penis bigger ok get the giggles over with its a common question one you would assume is usually asked in a hushed whisper but i cant even count the number of people who so nonchalantly ask this question in public is it actually bigger no does it look bigger absolutely i probably gained about of visible penis i was also told by a urologist that the higher testosterone from having lost weight can create a plumper flaccid penis as well as firmer erections which is the best diet highly subjective and depends on you keto was very effective in the shortterm but got very boring very fast for me however it kept me very strict knowing that i couldnt eat carbs for your average person i would recommend using keto for quick cuts when you need to strip some fat but if youre not going to stick to the diet for at least weeks dont bother otherwise just do iifym and keep your protein at an adequate level for your lean body mass did you ever consider suicide i dont think a person can be as large as i was and not at least consider it if only in passing luckily for me i am tall so i was able to carry the weight without losing significant mobility i couldnt hike a mile uphill but i could get across campus without feeling like i needed a ventilator so i never really felt like my life was over more like it was slightly impeded but yes there were times when it crossed my mind a few even involved loaded weapons being close if you are morbidly obese just overweight even if you are a geneticallygifted aesthetic goddess and you are considering suicide please get help there are lots of options for help regardless of where you are in the world you might think suicide will stop what you currently are feeling but it also robs you of everything you could be in the us you can call or go to the nearest emergency room also here is a list of suicide prevention orgs in various countries who do you see when you look in the mirror i dont see the new me but i also have been small enough long enough that i dont see the old me either i guess i see some amalgamation of the two maybe smallish is a simplified but adequate term to use what would you do different screw cardio thats what there was a period where i was doing hours of cardio days a week and after the st month i would stall hardcore at the time most people were afraid of fat and preached lowfat and cardio for weight loss as such if i could do it all over i would have went straight weight lifting and super light cardio the only upshot to all the cardio i did is that i have excellent cardiac vitals now blood pressure and a resting pulse of bpm if i am really rested it can drop into the upper s plus i can out cardio the and year olds i currently workout with what isnt a con of the weight loss but more of an annoyance clothes i cant imagine how much money ive spent on clothes or the amount of larger clothes i have given away i desperately need new jeans right now but i refuse to buy new ones because i know if i drop another lbs or some miracle happens and i can get the surgery this year they will be useless also shirts large for the upper torso xl for the lower spare tire of skin guess which size wins out xl every time so i look like lbs of flour in a lbs sack on my upper torso and lbs of flour in the same lbs sack on my lower do you do anything weight loss related with your experience i am a nonpracticing psychotherapistcounselor one of my goals in is to finally set up shop as a weight losssportseating disorder counselor perhaps even look into providing support for new bariatric patients whats next first i need to get my shoulder healed up i went from an incline press of lbs for reps to basically feeling like the bar is going to crush me within a day i have a friend who is a personal trainer we trade skills i get workoutform help from him and he gets dietmacro help from me he and i have been discussing where to go next for me first of all i need to get my upper body strength back was weeks since the injury so ive lost a lot of size especially in my shoulders once i get back to where i was id like to continue on the path to wherever it might lead i doubt i will ever compete or anything too damn old for that now but as they say age is just a number i always wanted to do the mammoth cave trog tour but even after dropping lbs ive realized my normal chest size is beyond their max diameter oh well i guess if i had to name something id like to do off the top of my head id like to climb a mountain maybe mt elbert or rainier something with proper snow and requires a bit of technical climbing ive always been a bit of an armchair mountaineer any tips or tricks crockpots get of them and constantly be using them you can have premeasured hot food anytime of day with maybe minutes prep each night plan you crock pot meal so that you can eat the entire thing throw it in around pm and cook overnight on low i do chicken breasts and beans kidney black chili or green beans for lower calories alot or even chickenbeef chilis or just slow cook a ton of meat to use for other stuff you can also opt to make extra then freezerefrigerate leftovers as you go to build up a small selection of takealong meals if anyone has any other questions or comments feel free to ask edit changed senior to junior senior year was when i started edit i really want to keep responding to everyones comments but im about to pass out ill try to respond to everyone tomorrow edit some people have questioned my height based on the girl standing next to me in one photo she was a college basketball player she is abnormally tall maths check the wall behind us standard building block height in the us is high there is exactly rows of blocks from feet to the top of my head that is before even adding in mortar seam height giving per mortar seam which there are of gives an additional inches making clearly there is some play with shoe sole thickness mortar thickness and overall camera angle but clearly enough data to show i am well over tall

alwaysbulking if you want to follow so how did i do it lets go down each transformation lbs to lbs in two years so in th grade i was lbs and pretty damn disgusted by myself i was playing basketball but i would break into a sweat in no time i had tried diets that my parents put me on before and i couldnt stick with anything finally my aunt went on a low carblike diet and lost lbs in the first week mind you i was at the time i figured this was real weight lost not water weight and lbs in the first two weeks total i figured hey i could do this the diet itself was not an atkins style diet it actually required lean meats as well you couldnt eat bacon or fatty hamburger meat or fatty fish my general weekly diet was unlimited amounts of lean protein week then week unlimited amounts of lean protein and nonstarchy carbs think tomatoes zucchini cucumber lettuce etc you alternated that until you hit your weight loss goal then you slowly brought carbs and all the other foods back in that you werent eating to get used to including them in your diet once more i lost lbs doing this and it was pretty simple the book itself was in french and my parents read the entire thing front to back translated the rules for me and helped me learn to cook for myself so i could make sure i stuck with it even if they were away for work and that i am truly appreciative of i did not really work out actually the summer between th grade and highschool i had a physical labor job picking horse manure out of stalls all summer which probably helped me lose weight there was no secret sauce here it was all diet to in years here it was a bit different i played sports year round in highschool and put size on because of that i was eating a normal diet aka back to carbs etc but i wasnt strict on anything aside from just avoiding junk food by senior year of high school i was close to lbs and pretty lean not amazingly lean definitely fatter than my lb college picture but not in bad shape considering i never lifted note i would kill for those teenager hormones again you look at weights and put size on in college i started lifting finally at the end of freshman year i got into the idea of powerlifting then did nothing during the summer working instead and got back to college and lifted again my programming for two years was a simple progressive loading x i would do x a week and did ck x a week for days total if i knew it would be a short week i threw ck in after my x day x breakdown not that it needs much explanation but i did x in a pretty straightforward manner day a squat bench chinups day b deadlift overhead press barbell row for squat and deadlift i started at lbs and added lbs each time i succeeded and upper body lifts i started with the bar and added for the bench until i broke pullups i needed to do assisted pullups and used all sorts of variants i lifted x a week alternating day a and day b after two years i competed in a powerlifting meet and pulled a lb deadlift a lb bench with a pause and a lb squat or so i had an issue with my hip that flared up every now and then and limited my squat training to football size walked on at final playing weight at i decided to try out for my schools daa football team in may as a junior entering my senior year i was sitting at lbs and figured if i was strong and fast enough i would have a chance i worked my ass off doing adays basically continuing my x programming x a week and doing oly lifts the rd day i was eating around calories a day and gaining weight very fast it wasnt until recently that my tdee has finally started to make sense i was doing a lot of plyometrics training running battle rope medicine ball swings running routesreceiver drills lb drills of all sorts running s and a whole bunch of other crap i ended the summer at and in pretty decent shape for that weight and asked the coach for a shot he laughed at me said this is a daa team you think you can walk on with football experience which made me laugh and i said well i hope to i ended up running some decent s all were under s during the summer and they gave me a shot only issue was we had about linebackers and they slotted me into nose and i needed to gain weight more mass is good in football for this stage i followed our strength coachs programming that was a lot of safer lifts than what i was doing power cleans db snatches trap bar deadlifts squats etc but not as much pure deadlifting and rms it definitely worked i got waaaay stronger and pulled a trap bar lb deadlift for during this time my squat went up to normal deadlift was and bench was touch and go and fat so after football ended i immediately started losing weight i was actually down to down about lbs from my heaviest weigh in i graduated college stoked about my new job that i was starting that august and slowly trailed down to in august i got news that my position was closed and they could no longer higher me due to policy reasons it was at a spanish bank spanish labor laws changed allegedly and they could only offer me a position if i was a year undergrad student at a spanish u regardless i started looking for another job and couldnt find one at all they all asked the same question why didnt i have a job out of college anyway that threw me down into a spiral of selfloathing and i ballooned right back up to at my peak i might have been even heavier i didnt want to weigh myself at times i stayed at that weight for close to years the turning point for me was when i went to cancun with a few friends everyone was running around and i was working on keeping up and then i looked down at myself and thought i was ridiculously fat and i couldnt do that i said fuck this and started a ketogenic diet again because for bulk weightloss i think it has to be the best thing out there i did a different version than from when i was a kid this time it had more fat i learned about proteins taking you out of ketosis if you eat too much and a diversified source of lowcarb veggies i got ketostix and went back to counting calories like i did in college the weight was melting off but i had no strength i hadnt trained strength at all in college i lost weight at a pretty astounding rate and in only a little over a year i lost lbs from to my lifting routine was all light db work and high levels of cardio and liss nothing exciting just getting in the gym to keep muscle mass as much as possible my back was shot and my knees were aching so i didnt squat or deadlift much to range this can all be found here i detailed it pretty extensively i went back to powerlifting i started off doing x then went to x then x and progressively worked on getting stronger i actually got down to a s yd dash as well which was always a goal of mine to get under i now currently do and added in first set last as a hypertrophy block diet is simple i shoot for g of protein usually chicken thigh or strip steak and fill in the rest i get most of my sugary carbs around workout sip one protein shake with half a scoop of highly branched cyclic dextrin during workout and another right after and the rest is vegetables and then a cookie or some other type of sweet treat after my main meal i eat fewer than calories per day at the moment and am working on a slow slow cut im a bit puffier than in the last photo ending thoughts i had a weird path throughout this time but now ive gotten a lot more fit and learned a bunch along the way its not easy but you have to hold yourself accountable for these changes i had a low tdee measured out to be around calories working out x a week at lbs and i still managed to cut weight i am sitting at around a calorie per day tdee currently at and working out less than i was when losing weight ultimately the way a friend recently said it about her cut as a bodybuilder was i want this burger right now more than i want to be lean in months and i realized i made that mental switch in my lifestyle choices i wanted to be lean in a year more than i wanted that burger or popeyes or alcoholic drink right then truthfully the real reason i even put all these photos together is because from august until about a month ago i was dreading going to the gym and hated it but i used these photos as a reminder for why i needed to keep up my routine ive kept the weight off for nearly two years and i honestly have to take it one week at a time to make sure i stay this weight if not lighter i dont talk much about diet at the moment on my instagram but i have a powerlifting focused one

420gpj,Fitness,2016-01-21 15:34:14,redditors over who worked out their entire lives do you observe any negative impacts im and ive been lifting consistently for the past years with some breaks i love it it makes me feel good and i definitely know the advantages i know injuries can suck but im wondering how the body is affected long term i assume there must be some joint damage somehow people over do you see any impact on your joints bonesetc anything us younger ones should be aware of long term thanks in advance edit wow i did not expect over upvotes and so many comments thanks a lot guys i was motivated enough but now im more thanks to you who look better and train more than us s for being living examples of what we should do to maintain proper health edit wow number in fitness cool support guys edit this is a pleasure to read through so much inspiration and great advice
4na853,Fitness,2016-06-09 10:37:00,months of diet and exercise made me a new person m lb lb read the last update today was a monumental milestone for me after spending most of my life being fat and a point of hitting rock bottom i finally got my shit together while i still have some ways to go im so happy that most of this journey is done with please dont wait to lose weight i feel times better than i ever did when i was at lbs mentally and physically the only thing that awaited me with that lifestyle was diabetes hypertension and a shorter time on this earth girls look at me now i dont worry about chairs creaking as i sit down and overall i have way more confidence than ever before i lost a lot of weight through intermittent fasting and eating keto for workout i was on icf but now do a modified version of coolcicadas ppl routine were all gonna make it edit to fix post for rules work out regiment push benchpress x overhead press x incline bench x dumbbell side lateral raises x dumbbell straight lateral raises x or if im weak rope pushdowns x machine at gym is resistance based so idk the weight overhead dumbbell extension x shrugs x pull chinups x bodyweight bent over row x lat pull down x seated row x facepulls x preacher curls x on machine then i do a dead set to get really pumped not sure if thats what its called but i start at and do as many reps as i can when i fail i drop lbs and repeat until no more weight tbar row x im a pussy on this one legs legs i keep very short but very grueling for me at least squats x i have shit form on squats so hurt myself so i do hack squats if my legs are messed up hack squats if not doing squats x plates dont know the weight of the sled deadlift x just hit one rep max of leg press x standing calf raises xfailure seated calf raises xfailure i also do x crunches at the end of every workout day not sure if theyre crunches you basically lift yourself by your forearms and raise your legs up to your chest no strength loss but slow gains diet intermittent fasting and eating keto were the methods used for this weight loss starting out i only ate one meal a day at dinner time whatever i wanted i chose this method because i had an unhealthy relationship with food and liked a lot of sweets i wanted a method of dieting that could control caloric intake while still allowing me to eat whatever i wanted yet still be satisfied following this method trying to eat a kcal meal was difficult so i knew i couldnt overeat later on i ate keto and found that i could eat very low in calories without being hungry and still be satisfied for the last lbs i didnt count calories at all i simply ate less than g of carbs and stayed away from sugar right now i still eat keto i would like to get to before i start bulking but i would guess that i eat around kcal a day typical meal breakfast would have two eggs slices of bacon and a protein shake dont really eat lunch i usually have some turkey jerky or cheese as a snack dinner i typically eat chicken breast or fish or hamburger tuna cheese maybe eggs and a protein shake there are a ton of great recipes on rketo for you to look at i also eat some celery and nuts but i really stick to meats the great part about this diet is how filling all the food is after dinner i simply have no interest in snacking supplements g whey before workouts mens multivitamin caffeine pills before workout edit thanks a lot for all the support guys it really does mean a lot to me i will answer any questions throughout the day if you have any thanks so much edit im getting a lot of questions that i want to answer with this edit first off i only did my workout which is listed for very specific reasons if you want to get into lifting dont do that read below motivation a lot of people have surprisingly asked me about this the typical message is to the tune of i really want to lose weight or look better but i have trouble taking the first step the one thing i can tell you is that almost everyone who is lifting weights in the gym now started for a completely different reason most people start working out for the wrong assumption it will help them lose weight they have dreams of being envied of having a rockhard body that ladies swoon for or becoming something other than the scrawny kid theyve been their whole life i know that was the case for me i wasnt getting laid and boy did i have an appetite for women but something happens within the first few months of lifting seriously you start to notice progress not just superficial progress but strength suddenly you attempt a deadlift at a weight you couldnt even get off the ground before and there you are fully extended with the weight held firmly in your hands your muscles will be pumped full of blood and feel like theyre about to rip through your skin its a feeling that cannot be adequately described with words and this is my advice to you use whatever motivates you now to get into the gym and stick it out because that motivation will change the truth is it will take a long time to have a body that belongs on a magazine cover if this is your main goal you will fail simply because it takes too long to reach it but when you come to appreciate strength and realize you can become stronger if even only a little bit each month you will keep coming back what how should i eat im a big fan of quotes so i apologize in advance if you dont remember anything im about to say remember these two you cannot outrun a bad diet weight loss is diet a lot of people set themselves up to fail as soon as they start wanting to lose weight they see a post like mine and think i want to do that im going to lose this weight they then create a plan which requires herculean willpower theyre going to cut calories by half and train everyday until theyre skinny inevitably they fail binge the weight back on and repeat even though this pattern is very apparent with people we know in our lives many simply fail to recognize it how many times have your family members or friends gone on a diet and failed we all know more than one person who has its surprisingly common the reason for this is what i chalk up to ignorance especially with people that others look for guidance one thing i want to make very clear please understand this you can lose weight by working out times a week and simply by eating less you can also cross the ocean in a canoe instead of a plane what is so difficult about dieting and nutrition is that many people can see results through inefficient means our bodies are complex machines of nature but yet we like to attribute weight loss down to simple axioms like calories in calories out when we see someone who has results we think they must be doing something right and suddenly the guy who read starting strength one time and goes on the bodybuildingcom forums feels like he is the nutrition guru one thing that really irks me is exactly calories in calories out of course calories matter but not in the way people think a lot of people become very defensive about their little rule if someone loses weight on a caloric surplus theyre lying if theyre not losing weight on a deficit theyre not just stalling theyre lying these same people that tell you that only calories matter are also the same people that will tell you there is a difference between a clean dirty bulk that a carbrefeed doesnt simply mean eating a pizza and that you should eat more protein for muscle growth we know that fat accumulation has other factors than just calories all im asking is it so hard to believe macronutrients play a part of losing weight is it such a stretch to believe we maybe evolved to digest some food better than others i dont think its a radical proposal many people can see results by simply cutting calories when we do this we tend to eat healthier foods anyway we tend to stop eating fast food and keep track of what we eat try this out and see if it works for you otherwise you should try a diet that makes it very hard to overeat i for one dont track calories at all i am currently on a intermittent fasting regiment where i only eat from every day it is extremely hard to overeat when youre devouring only one or two huge meals i tend to mostly eat lean meat which is very filling but i also eat bread and even ice cream or pizza when i feel like it i really have to force myself to eat to get to a surplus something most people easily do each day another easy way to control dieting is keto because the food is so filling you rarely feel hungry and the calories are pretty low both of these lifestyles allow your body to spend more time burning fat keep an eye out for the type of people that do certain diets and learn from them if you go to rketo for example most people seem to have a sweet tooth or a binge eating problem that they effectively control through the diet when they fall off the wagon they gain a lot of weight back i dont have these problems so i lost a good amount of fat regained the water weight from the glycogen coming back into my muscles but have been losing more weight since then this is why it is important to take notice of when you tend to eat what you crave and ask yourself why you have gained weight in the first place i had a terrible diet where i ate nothing but fast food and pizza during the week it seems so apparent now how much i was screwing up but i just didnt really care at the time i was in denial dont be like me other people i know have mental blocks that keep them plump like binge eating disorder if you have a mental issue with food you need to recognize the thoughts and feelings that lead up to the unhealthy behavior how should i work out if youre read the diet portion of this we already know that lifting weights will not help you lose weight efficiently at least so if youre working out you should be after two things which are actually one thing muscle and strength you can read this article which will tell you basically one thing bodybuilding is powerlifting and powerlifting is bodybuilding if you work hard and continually push yourself muscle will grow you will see results good artists copy great artists steal look at that link and read how many great people have used this advice not one piece of advice has helped me in more parts of life than this when we steal we take something and make it our own when we want to build our muscle we look at those who inspire us people who are champions we then must do what they do and tailor it to fit our own bodies lets look at popular training methods that are used by people interested in strength training from beginners to advanced lifters icf x starting strength stronglifts x the texas method madcow x one thing youll notice is that all of these programs are very similar all of them have you only work out three days a week and some only three exercises a day in our lives we are often erroneously taught that time results a novice might look at these programs and think my cousin chad spends hours a day in the gym days a week and hes jacked but once again we come back to my analogy you can cross the ocean in a canoe or in a plane its your choice do you think martin berkhan or mark rippetoe look weak mark created starting strength which is what a lot of the programs above are based on these people understand the biology of the human body compound lifts like bench press squats and deadlifts work your whole body and build muscle like no other rest is a vital component of building mass something a lot of people dont seem to understand if youre looking to start lifting with no prior experience start with icf or starting strength and get cracking i hope this helps some people out whoever reads this thanks for all the support again

ezdecy,Fitness,2020-02-05 17:53:35,one year without missing a workout m tldr busy dad of three small kids makes moderate progress during one year of focusing on consistency hitting a workout streak i ran nsuns lp day routine did a decent job of bulking and cutting and didnt sleep nearly enough edit thanks for the support guys its awesome to hear from so many of you and for the gold beforeafter pics bonus postbulk chonk pic typical training log xb liftsstartingcurrentrm bench press squat deadlift overhead press im giving these as the heaviest set in my weekly routine rather than just a rm or tm i feel its more representative of the work i actually put in and reflects how much i deloaded at the start of the year streaking im putting this at the top because its been the key to my results over the last year this is the most important progress pic of all my and calendars every day i complete a workout i highlight it on the calendar deloads are blue and i cant believe how motivating just crossing the day off has been that tiny act gave me the motivation to start a streak long enough to develop the discipline to keep going through family challenges frequent work travel nagging aches and pains and several bouts of illness every day i dont feel like working out im not just asking myself do i feel like working out today its does the streak end today the answer is no most dedication our whole family was coming down with stomach flu so before the nausea got too bad i got my ass downstairs and did squat day before spending the night vomiting streak preserved closest call one week in december dealing with aches and pains holiday stress generally poor mental health and family conflict i ended up deloading my last two workouts of the week cutting a lot of the accessories and doing them both on the last day of the week background my fitness journey from until late consisted mainly of semiconsistent running with periodic spells of messing around with bodyweight exercises in the gym ive always been a fairly active person my friends would call me fit but i never really focused on one thing with enough consistency to see substantial results nor did i really know what results i was looking for from track and cross country in high school to several years of trail running i found my way to lifting in late because i wanted to improve my core strength and stability on long training runs late through march was my true beginner period i ran stronglifts x for four months starting with the bar and eventually transitioning to tinkering with several of jim wendlers templates i learned a ton in this time and did get stronger but i probably only hit of the workouts in a typical month i would fall off the wagon come back and hit it too hard experience some minor injury and repeat i also struggled to balance my lifting and running while training for mi trail races and didnt have a clear sense of my training priorities in late march i injured both of my knees on april my twin sons were born and in late may our family relocated crosscountry to be closer to family as you might expect this triggered a sixmonth period without any training whatsoever we were all just surviving by november i was starting to feel ready to be active again i finally set up my home gym and ran out of excuses it took a couple of months to get consistent but by the beginning of february i started a streak of workouts that brings me to today exercise i started my current streak by deloading substantially across the board with a focus on form and finding reasonable accurate sustainable working weights i spent a lot of time reflecting on my prior lifting experience and selecting a program opting for the fourday version of nsuns lp program to which ive made gradual tweaks over the course of the year heres that link to a typical current week again while id like to someday move to a fiveday routine the fourday program has given me the flexibility i need to hit of the workouts the main lifts are programmed in the template but i did spend a lot of time finding accessories that match my functional and physique goals my number one priority is building a stronger thicker back and ive adjusted the routine over the course of the year to add back volume this is followed by improving my shoulder health combating computer posture and getting enough core volume the most substantial change ive made after a bout of pt for nagging shoulder and neck pain this summer was swapping closegrip bench for barbell row on the second bench day and adding exercises to strengthen my rotator cuff ill be happy to answer any questions about my programming decisions in the comments finally i take a lowkey approach of listening to my body i dont recover from workouts like i used to so if i have a nagging pain i back off for a week or two and i take deload weeks when i can tell im getting beat up and need a break diet after a month or two of streaking without focusing on my diet i spent six months between march and august gradually bulking without tracking calories or macros i just didnt have the mental space to try and manage that while focusing on just hitting my workouts while bulking from to i did have two goals eat a lot of food and get grams of protein every hours thats all i focused on prior to this period i spent literal years tracking my diet so i know from experience that i maintain weight at calories per day more importantly i have an intuitive sense of how much food that is that said i put on some excess weight bulking and perhaps could have done it cleaner key bulking foods for me homemade yogurt and granola protein granola bars big bowls of cereal a couple of protein shakes per day i like myprotein impact whey which i buy unflavored in the giant lb sacks and mix with milk and g of creatine per day toward the end of my bulk i felt huge full all the time and ready to lose some weight from september through middecember i cut from down to using intermittent fasting i tracked my diet religiously during this point shooting for caloriesday and grams of protein i prefer to eat a moderatefat diet based on foods i like so i found it difficult to increase my protein intake beyond this level while maintaining a deficit i did not reduce my workout volume while cutting except to deload somewhat more often my lifts didnt decrease much over this period when doing if id fast until noon then eat an calorie lunch a calorie afternoon snack and the remaining calories at dinner i enjoy a beer or two in the evenings and like to feel full i wasnt religious about timing my final calories for the day to start my fast since middecember ive taken breaks from fasting and fasted a little here and there my weight is basically unchanged lessons learned my big takeaway from the last year it that its hard to build new habits and you really have to choose your battles could i have bulked more efficiently could i have cut harder or longer could i have made more aggressive progress in my lifts maybe but i might also have been spreading myself too thin fallen off the wagon and wound up where i started as a thirtysomething dad with three kids under five years old my time energy and mental space are so finite and i think ive spent my limited resources in the best possible way this year of course i also feel a tremendous sense of pride ive seen physique progress for the first time in my life but more importantly i feel stronger and more functional in challenging tasks i feel like ive built the foundation for my future gains finally never underestimate the power of a streak or finding whatever little psychological tricks you can play on yourself to get where you want to be next steps as for the future im writing this with an ice pack on my groin recovering from a vasectomy so rest is on my mind im going to continue the streak with something light tomorrow and spend the next two weeks on a long deload i want to focus on resting up easing the various aches and pains and getting stoked for another year ill probably never bulk more than lb at a time again but once i hit ill cut lb off and generally just gradually try to get bigger and leaner over time my major training goal for is to focus on time under tension and really quality reps if you made it this far thanks for reading im happy to continue the discussion in the comments
2yozrg,Fitness,2015-03-11 16:49:26,back an anatomical guide to training you can find my previous posts right here biceps an anatomical guide to training triceps an anatomical guide to training deltoids an anatomical guide to training anatomy the back is composed of a lot of muscles to simplify things im going to split the back into three sections the trapeziustraps the upper back and the latissimus dorsilats lower back will be covered under the core blog traps originate start on the c t vertebrae insert attach on the lateral aspect of the clavicle collar bone and on the acromion and spine of the scapula the traps are separated into sections the upper middle and lower fibres lats the lats have many origins these include but are not limited to the t l vertebrae iliac crest of the sacrum and the inferior angle of the scapula they insert on the humerusupper arm a very interesting fact about the lats is that they are the only muscle that are attached to both the upper limb arm and the lower body hip upper back the upper back consists of various muscles the rhomboid major and minor originate on the tt and ct vertebrae and attach on the medial border of the scapula the teres major and teres minor originate on the lateral border of the scapula and attach on the humerus the infraspinatus and supraspinatus originate on the infraspinous fossa and supraspinous fossa of the scapula and attach on the humerus function traps remember that the traps have upper middle and lower fibres each of these fibres play a specific role giving the trapezius muscle many roles the upper fibres primarily elevate the scapula the middle fibres primarily retract the scapula the lower fibres depress the scapula another function of the traps is that they prevent humeral dislocation they prevent your arm from popping out of your shoulder lats the lats have two primary functions arm adduction shoulder extension upper back the main function of the muscles of the upper back is to retract the shoulder blade training tips ive seen guys with big arms and big pecs that werent that strong but ive never seen a guy with a big back that wasnt strong this is one of my favorite quotes a big muscular back does not come without strength i personally believe that to fully develop a big back it is important to deadlift squat and even perform some of the olympic lifts cleans snatches although the lifts stated above place a large emphasis on the lower body the back plays a fundamental role while performing them youll have a tough time finding a successful powerlifter or weightlifter that doesnt have a large back but putting those lifts aside back specific work is very important a trick i use for almost all rowing movements is using a thumbless grip a lot of people myself included have the tendency to pull more so with their arms rather than their back using a thumbless grip lets me envision my arms as hooks for my back allowing me to really focus on contracting my back muscles rather than using my biceps to pull keep in mind that using a thumbless grip also requires higher grip strength in order to hold on to the bar some people are taught that exercises using a wider grip will make your back wider while a closer grip will make your back thicker although i am not aware of any scientific studies proving this i believe it to be true this is through anecdotal evidence i have witnessed in my own body and many professional bodybuilders also vouch for this a back day for me consists of lat movements and upper back movements i train traps on my shoulder day traps training for the average person their trap routine goes no further than holding very heavy weight and barely shrugging it moving their shoulder about a centimeter up and down although this can be fairly effective there are ways to train this muscle that are much safer and are much more efficient deadlifts dumbbell shrugs one of the most underrated exercises for developing the traps is deadlifts one of the functions of the traps mentioned above is to keep the humerus attached to the shoulder when you perform a deadlift the traps are working like crazy to ensure that the weight you are holding on your hands doesnt rip your arm out of its socket big deadlift numbers are often associated with big traps powerlifter pete rubish who is well known for his monstrous deadlifts is also well known for his cobra like traps going back to shrugs it is important to recall the functions of all fibres of the traps remember that they not only elevate the shoulder but they also retract the scapula when doing shrugs it is important to keep your shoulder blades retracted the entire time neglecting this will not only hinder your trap development but it will also have a negative impact on your posture over time here is a good video explaining how to keep perform shrugs correctly i have personally found medows shrugs to the best shrug variation to develop my traps paul carter explains them here a very common mistake when doing shrugs is rolling your shoulders as you do them this is not safe for your shoulders can result in injury very quickly lats training the lats are one of the most important muscles in the body for healthy movement and athletic function in almost any professional sport that involves a need for power or physical contact youll see big lats this is visible even in smaller fighters like manny pacquiao of my back training revolves around my lats when training them it is important to perform both overhead movements as well as rows in the horizontal plane bentover barbell rows rows pull ups pull down tbar rows cable pull overs if you clicked on the videos linked for the exercises above youll notice that almost every single video is linked to kai greene this was done intentionally because i believe kai has perfected back training when you train a muscle you need to stretch it and then contract it the lats are stretched when your arm moves overhead it is important to apply this to your rows when you are targeting your lats kai demonstrates this perfectly in both his barbell and dumbbell rows at the bottom of each rep he lets the weight hang forward you can see this here on his barbell row and here on his dumbbell row this type of movement lets you stretch the lats as much as you can during these exercises which allows for a much better contraction when you pull the weight you will also notice that he pulls the weight to his stomach again this lets you contract the lats fully when you pull the weight to your chest you will be using your upper back at a higher scale than your lats here are the barbell row and dumbbell row videos again pull ups are arguably the best lats exercise there is you can fully stretch the lats through their range of motion and fully contract them as well i like to super set these with lat pull downs i like to alter my grip width for both of these exercises regularly to target different parts of my latsback yes i know its broscience but i believe in it most people believe that pullovers are primarily a chest exercise but when done correctly they are an excellent lats exercise they are also a great way to teach yourself how to really flare your lats upper back training i dont spend a lot of time specifically on upper back training because i feel that it is hit sufficiently through all of my movements that are targeted for my lats i usually perform one exercise specifically for my upper back wide grip cable rows barbell rows to chest the function of the upper back is specifically to retract the scapula when you perform a row it is important to really squeeze your shoulder blades together to fully work the muscles you want to with people who are new to this concept i like to put a finger in the middle of their back and tell them to try and squeeze my finger with their shoulder blades with each rep to fully maximize this you can protract your scapula as seen in image a at the beginning of a row which will fully stretch the upper back muscles and then only squeeze the scapula together when you pull towards yourself tldr splitting the back into upper back lats and traps when

6re9k5,Fitness,2017-08-03 18:16:46,heres what a year of fitness did for me as a complete newbie beforeafter this is from july to july m height before picture weight pounds yes really my legs can hold some serious weight bro after picture weight currently sitting at pounds lifts disclaimer i didnt log weights until i started taking ppl seriously so the starting weight may not be exact but im confident that this is pretty close i had never lifted a weight before starting out so my lifts were overall very weak to start with bench x lbs lbs squat x lbs lbs overhead press x lbsi think lbs deadlift x lbs lbs rows x lbs lbs i actually did x for squats for a while because i wasnt paying attention and didnt realize it was supposed to be x at first once i started over on my squats i did the proper x and its been climbing since then some might call into question why my squat and deadlift are so low well because i didnt do that shit for way too long with squats in particular i got some nasty tendentious in my hip and had to build back up to my squat slowly from again i finally climbed back up to this past week and my hip feels just fine is also feeling pretty easy right now so im confident that it will rise to a more normal squat for my size easily for deadlifts i was afraid id snap my back in half originally and just felt like i could skip them id slap past me if i could im still heavily focused on form and tend to drop the weight once my back shows any sign of curling im deadlifting currently but can probably do a bit more once i lock down my form program october jaunary from october until january i fucked around with a halfassed brosplit i was cutting heavily at the time pounds a week on average lifting was entirely new to me so i learned from a coworker at the time who praised his brosplit routine and i fully embraced it i worked days a week meandering around the gym and just sort of picking heavy shit up program january march this is when i came across metallicadpas ppl routine on this subreddit i decided to do a halfassed version of it with dumb bells and continued to kinda fuck around with mostly working out days a week i didnt do deadlifts or squats because i wasnt confident in deadlifts and felt like leg press was a substitute for squats yeah i know i followed the rest of the programs lifts but wasnt doing the program i substituted barbell exercises with dumb bells because i was more comfortable that way and i wasnt keeping track of my lifts at all pro tip dont do that towards the end here i started deadlifting i started with pounds and genuinely couldnt go up in weight my lower back and hamstrings were way too weak program march current i decided to get my shit together and actually do the ppl routine i got myself a little book logged my weights and progressed with barbell exercises like i should i followed and still follow the program to a tee now within two weeks i felt a huge difference in strength this is also when i started my first bulk i cut pounds of fat and could have gone a little further but i was pretty excited to start my first bulk i bulked from march until early july and went from lbs lbs i originally planned to bulk until october and then cut for summer of but i got a girlfriend and she foiled my plans im currently cutting some body fat for a month or two before i begin lean bulking through fall and winter diet at first i wanted to blame my metabolism for my initial weight gain in reality it was from getting my first desk job and not changing the way i ate i learned through this subreddit and the wiki rather quickly that i was being a damned fool i initially cut my calories by limiting my meals to sandwiches and frozen burritos every day thats literally all i ate for months i initially justified this because it was dirt cheap and effective for weight loss i didnt take into account that eating a nutritionally void diet makes you feel pretty awful you can get nutrition for cheap you can eat more food if you eat less calorie dense foods go figure after months of my awful diet i switched over to a strict meal plan that i still generally follow to this day i eat protein shake whey whole milk and peanut butter tastes great with coffee concentrate if you have it chicken broccoli rice beef and eggs and if im feeling crazy sometimes avocado andor cottage cheese and thats about it i eat the same thing just about every single day and i enjoy it the lack of variety doesnt bother me though i still eat other things on the weekends to enjoy my food a bit more with my friends and family the main reason for my ridiculously cheap meal plan is that im one frugal motherfucker and this keeps my grocery bill about as cheap for complete nutrition as you can get this diet doesnt include fish so i supplement with fish oil i take animal thats the brand not talking about animal shaped gummies here lol multivitamins as well just to ensure that im not missing out on any minerals or vitamins further ramblings i actually posted my progress on here before youll notice i get called out for my lifts seeming a bit odd when people asked for them thats because i wasnt logging anything and just kinda guessed where i thought things were at it helped me realize i still wasnt doing things optimally and im sure i still have a lot to learn how do you prepare your food for the shake i blend up the ingredients in a shake bottle with a lid attachment so similar to a bullet takes me less than a couple minutes to whip up chug and clean laziest breakfast ever for the chicken and broccoli i throw that shit in the oven and watch netflix for minutes take out the broccoli and then take out the chicken after minutes i make a shit ton of rice every week or so in roughly minutes and then everything goes in the fridgefreezer i toss my lunch foods into meal prep containers and then im done how is this year of progress if you started lifting in october i started dieting in july last year and went to the gym a few times but i didnt really try and take lifting seriously until october how much food do you eat that changes depending on my current goal im currently eating around calories a day on a cut and while bulking i was eating around calories a day how about seasoning some kickin chicken seasoning from walmart copious amounts of hot sauce for the chicken and then i cover my broccoli with steak seasoning sounds weird but its tasty as fuck for the beef and eggs i just use salt pepper and you guessed it more hot sauce your previous post didnt have rice in the meal plan i actually didnt add the rice until i started my bulk and so i was effectively on a keto diet adding rice made a massive difference in my overall energy ill never go back to low carb i didnt realize how much energy i was missing out on until i reintroduced them what are your long term fitness goals this goal shifts a lot at first i just didnt want to be fat now i wanna look as good as i can with my clothes off i think im going to want to improve my cardiovascular fitness as well because i currently dont do any cardio whatsoever once my linear progression stalls my squat and bench are still steadily climbing ill probably switch to why dont you do cardio dont feel like it its good for you i know ill step up my cardio game at some point how about creatine i add creatine to my shake every morning preworkout once in a blue moon ill take it if im feeling fogheaded and dont have work the next day but generally i dont feel like i need it warmups are usually enough to get my ready to lift at my best what do you do for warmups i usually just do reps with really low weight to get the blood moving if that doesnt get me going ill add a little weight before tackling my big lift what about your progress on your legs and back i sadly never took progress photos of either but i can take a shot of my back and legs and add it to the album if people are curious why are your starting lifts so low were you really that weak no probably not but these were the numbers i started with keep in mind i was completely new and learning proper form from scratch here while trying to move up in weightreps every day so these weights seemed to work for me at the time tldr i read the wiki and good things happened looking forward to year edits for clarity and such
368cn2,Fitness,2015-05-17 03:48:48,meal prep so easy a caveman can do itnewbie guide intro after years of dieting and trying to cook healthy with limited success ive found a system that works for me this is my easy mode meal prep feel free to swap ingredients however you want i am posting this more or less as a newbie guide to follow for those who are struggling to find a way to fix a meal that meets the holy trinity of being cheap healthy and easy this isnt perfect but what is have fun with it and make it your own nbsp things you might want to consider purchasing before you begin your meal prep journeythese are what i use nbsp a scale microwavable multiuse plastic containers nbsp according to myfitnesspal the macros for this batch calories g carbs g fat g protein nbsp psi threw in a lot of broccoli so the cals are on the high end but you dont have to do whatever you want homie usually my meals are in the cal range nbsp step one shoppingtime to pull out your hard earned pennies for the sake of simplicity i am going to assume you already have some basic spices cookware and at least ramenmaking level culinary skills if you dont thats fine but youll have to figure that shit out on your own im not going to do everything for you nbsp below is the stuff i had to pick up from the store i was on a time crunch so i kind of just grabbed stuff i change it up every time but the important things to always grab are a lean protein i always use chicken breast good veggies that have a lot of fiberfrozen fresh canned whatever you feel like man and either brown rice or quinoa nbsp lbs chicken breastlb one big yellow onion raw nonorganic broccolilbs yeah nonorganic im cheap orange peppers one box of brown rice add it all up big meals for just under bucks not terrible when you consider its a pop if you arent in the mood for a ton of veggies you can easily omit the peppers and onions and magically you are at per meal even better cheaper gainz huzzah nbsp step two go home step three preheat the oven to step four start chopping seriously chop like your life depended on it i chopped up the broccoli the peppers the onions and then the chicken weigh your ingredients now before you cook them its easier and later you can just divide your totals by the amount of containers you will equally fill and you have an easy way to get your macros much easier than weighing each container as you scoop stuff into it who cares if your containers vary slightly in size itll average out over the next few days nbsp the rest of these steps can be done simultaneously or in whatever order you feel like just prioritize starting the chicken and the rice before the veggies and it should all finish about the same time nbsp step five get out a baking dish something that can fit all that chopped up chicken that youre about to cook line it with foil and fill it with your chicken season that shit up and mix it around i used garlic powder salt pepper and some generic poultry seasoning use whatever you want when your oven is done preheating throw your chicken in the oven let it cook about minutes check it every after that cutting into it and making sure there are no pink parts left step six follow the directions on the boxed brown rice its easy step seven grab a large pan with a lid that fitstrust me its pretty important and throw all your broccoli in there with cups of water put it on the stove and crank it up to high when it starts boiling turn down the heat and put the lid on it cooksteam the broccoli to desired texture step eight fry up your chopped onions and peppers in medium sized pan on mediumhigh heati didnt use any oil but you can you can throw in garlic powder or extra seasonings if you like i did its done when the onions look glassy and the peppers are soft nbsp step nine woohoo you made it the fun part now that everything is cooked to perfection you can put everything into your containers i had seven on hand so this will be seven meals for me i like to start with the rice and layer the chicken broccoliveggies on top i do this so i have to eat all the veggies before getting to the good stuff step ten i drizzled hot sauce and soy sauce on top of each step eleven pack it up put it away wash your dishes and go calculate your macros easy peasey you are done congrats it should look something like this nbsp tldr pictures bucks a meal depending on how you make it with good macrosat least i think so obligatory edit this is not my only source of nutrition and i do not recommend only eating this meal as a diet i eat these mostly for lunch and or dinner i personally am doing iffym with roughly a cpf split on a small caloric deficit but that doesnt matter make it work for you edit whoa this got a much bigger response than i anticipated if there is interest i can make a more detailed post explaining how i track macros more meal ideas ideas on making the meals better fit your macros and general advice on meal prep edit gold thank you anonymous super hero i am glad you enjoyed my post hope it helps also if you guys look in the comments several users have recreated their version of the meal and posted their costs pictures etc i recommend checking them out for addition inspiration and advice edit last one a lot of people are still messaging me for advice on a wide range of things while i am more than happy to answer specific questions i recently read a book that answers almost all the questions ive gotten bigger leaner stronger by michael matthews i bought the ebook from amazon on sale for cents and after reading it would have gladly paid for it fantastic read backed by countless studies cant recommend it enoughno i am not affiliated with him in any way i am just a fan

fnrkhd,Fitness,2020-03-23 20:44:31,how to make gains without a gym a lot of people are currently without gym access due to quarantines and lockdowns so i wrote an article about how to go about maintaining your progress or making gains without gym access to be clear its not a how to set up a home gym article if you have the money and space for a home gym gym closures probably arent affecting you much and its not written with the assumption that youre planning on joining rbodyweightfitness and never going to the gym again rather its about strategies you can use to adapt normal strength or hypertrophy training for a period of time without gym access with minimal cost since gyms are so ubiquitous and affordable in most places i think most people just havent ever had to think about how theyd train for weeks or months without a gym however you can do some effective training with no equipment or very minimal equipment push training is pretty easy pushups bodyweight triceps extensions and handstand pushups are all good ways to train your pecs triceps and delts you can progress by increasing reps over time instead of increasing load or you can progress to increasingly challenging variations of these exercises to increase intensity pull training is a little more challenging with absolutely no equipment but is quite a bit easier if you have an overthedoorframe pullup bar without a pullup bar table rows are a great option and you can add load by loading a backpack with books or other heavy household items if there are trees nearby you can do pullups on a tree branch again using a backpack for added resistance and if you have some large water jugs you can use them as dumbbells for curls lower body training is more of a challenge bodyweight squats probably come to mind first but theyre quite easy for people who are already in pretty good shape however strict stepups just tapping your heel to the floor and getting no assistance from your down leg are way more challenging than a lot of people realize even if youre just using your body weight as resistance and are easy to progress since you probably have items of varying heights around your house building toward pistols is also a great challenge and if you dont have knee issues bodyweight sissy squats can also provide a great challenge to your quads for posterior chain training singleleg glute bridges are surprisingly challenging especially if performed strictly and its fairly easy to add load via a loaded backpack if you have someone or something to anchor your ankles nordic hamstrings curls are hard if youre willing to make just one purchase you should seriously consider a set of bands it would be impossible to list every exercise you can do with a set of strong resistance bands because the list would include virtually every exercise you could do with barbells or machines bands also help you add resistance or assistance to virtually all bodyweight exercises in terms of programming progressive overload is still the name of the game instead of just adding more weight to the bar you may need to be a little more creative with bodyweight exercises you can either increase reps or increase intensity by building up to more challenging versions of the exercises youre doing you can also increase weight via a loaded backpack for a lot of exercises for band exercises you can either add more bands into the mix or choke up on bands to increase intensity you can also just add reps in general as long as you have an objective way to make and measure progress you should be able to maintain muscle pretty easily and probably keep building muscle in terms of strength your maxes may be down a bit once you can get back under a bar but as long as you maintained or built muscle any strength decrements should simply be due to rusty motor patterns rather than true strength losses as long as you have a good idea of the exercises at your disposal you shouldnt need to make any huge changes to a training program just sub out your current exercises for other exercises that accomplish the same basic purpose probably change the setrep scheme for people on strength programs youre probably going to be looking at higher rep ranges for the time being and keep the gains rolling heres the link to the article again the meatandpotatoes of it is the list of exercises at the end that you can do with no equipment or minimal equipment most of them link out to pages or videos demonstratingexplaining each exercise hopefully its useful for folks who will be without gym access for the time being
494tk1,Fitness,2016-03-05 23:41:02,m months of blood sweat and tears introduction as i am typing this up i have a feeling you are all in for a very long thread so let me get that out of the way first i will try to provide a structured and hopefully easy to read wright up for the last months of my life with that out of the way lets get to the backstory backstory i do not feel bad if you decide to skip this section its not really relevant in how the transformation happened but it is important for me and why it did over months ago i was started losing the battle to severe depression it got to the point where i was unintentionally starving myself and every day just hoping something terrible would happen to me passive suicidal thoughts where rampant and motivation to even get out of bed was an incredibly hard mountain to climb while i rather not go into the reason why i ended up here i will say that it was by far the hardest time in my life as time went on the negativity crept into not only myself and my self image but everything i said or did it tended to breed itself into a viscous monster that ate and bad things continued to happen or at least that is how it seemed anything good that was there i instantly snuffed out and choose to look at the reality of the situation then that is when i realized i hit rock bottom i decided there was two options for me stay in this depressive self loathing state and wait for my bad luck to kill me or stand up and fight it so here is where it all started i just hit my golden birthday in august and i choose to fight i signed up for the gym that day and got myself a personal trainer later that week that choice to have someone help me wasnt easy but i knew that without motivation and someone keeping me honest i would fail and be right back to where i was three months prior he not only helped me with my physical training but also helped me mentally stabilize and see the good that was all around me so out of everything this thread is a dedication to the man that unknowing saved my life addressed to my personal trainer if by some weird chance you happen to read this thank you thank you so much workout cards every weeks i would perform a new set of workouts rotating workouts has been instrumental to me having the success i have been seeing by having the workouts and lifts mixed up every so often the muscles continued to see growth and progress this is an example of my current workout card and lifting weights i have had so many workout cards for me that to list them all would take me days most of the workout cards are similarly based also this is custom tailored to me and my personal goals i would strongly advise if you are going to base a workout on something similar to this know your own body and do your research the last day for this week will have the previous weight i accomplished with a signifying that if possible i will attempt to lift more next week lower body once a week rest exercise sets date date

circuit of several different types of planks holds and weighted crunches nothing particularly special about it just fight through the pain cardio once a week i will do some intense cardio honestly back in high school i was a skinny cross country runner so obviously my preference is running but i hate running on a treadmill so i tend to make sure i mix up my cardio with either biking or running at least mins of activities on these days but usually i will push myself to go for an hour or so distance and speed does not matter just so long as its an active nonstop pace nutrition so as if the workouts where not intense enough the nutrition is actually the hardest part at least for me every day i have pushed or have tried to push myself to eat calories to help keep me honest and make sure that my diet is on point i log everything through myfitnesspal the balance between carbs fats and protein is divided respectively my diet usually consists of whole grain pasta dishes and lots of different types of meats this has been the hardest part for me being a broke poor college student learning to budget and cook proper meals has been an insane challenge supplements protein powder multivitamins fish oils and creatine results height now we get to my favorite part numerical results pictures can be deceiving and not only that they dont tell the full story but pure hard data in my opinion is not only encouraging but needed for proper growth measurements are in inches and in pounds measurements are taken about every two weeks or so while weight is recorded each week honestly i am surprised that the weight improvement is as consistent as it is date body weight neck arm chest waist hip thigh calf body fat body fat test are done usually once a month and done by the point pinch test triceps pectorals scapula midax abs iliac and the quads todays measurements i do not measure these myself cause for a pinch test you cant but my trainernutritionist does tricep mm pec scap midax abs iliac quad on i had a body fat percentage of with lbs of lean body muscle and lbs of body fat today i had a body fat percentage of with lbs of lean body muscle and lbs of body fat that is an increase of lbs of muscle and lbs of body fat pictures now for the pictures not sure if these are consider nfsw but ill tag it as such just to be safe all the pictures are taken as i am standing in my compression shorts taken on aug st starting picture side view dogs a creep taken on march st front side flex side side by side comparison summary the last months have been one hell of a journey not

gomwgi,Fitness,2020-05-22 16:48:46,i just completed a murph a week for a year murph every week for a year ive come too far to only come this far start mlbs kg cm end mlbs kg cm what is murph from crossfitcom for time mile run pullups pushups squats mile run in memory of navy lieutenant michael murphy of patchogue ny who was killed in afghanistan june th this workout was one of mikes favorites and hed named it body armor from here on it will be referred to as murph in honor of the focused warrior and great american who wanted nothing more in life than to serve this great country and the beautiful people who make it what it is partition the pullups pushups and squats as needed start and finish with a mile run if youve got a twenty pound vest or body armor wear it murph is traditionally run once a year on us memorial day last monday of may why every week for a year around end of march i got injured when squatting relatively light weight without bracing adequately something pinged deep in my left glutehip region and i unwisely tried to continue through the pain over the next few weeks although the pain began to subside anytime i attempted to squat or deadlift anything over kg the shooting pain would return a pt suggested i give squatting and deadlifting a rest for a while naturally i immediately catastrophised my situation and thought my lifting days were over she also gave me a minute stretching routine which i kept up for months but which seemed to be having no positive effect around this time rweightroom posted a challenge to attempt a murph i knew i was able to perform pullups having been through a few cycles of building the monolith and figured that id be able to complete it if i could get through the air squats without the pain being too great in the weeks leading up to the challenge i did dry runs unweighted what i discovered was that while the pain was manageable during the running the high reps of squats actually helped relieve the pain albeit marginally on the day of the wr challenge i made the last minute decision to perform the murph with my kg weighted vest and completed in just under an hour after the weightroom challenge i had the idea that committing to a murph a week for a year would be a good way to regularly push myself and buildmaintain my conditioning while rehabbing and hopefully rebuilding my squat and deadlift from an egosquashing kg with day full body bbbbbs i thought that by the end of the weeks i would at the very least get better at doing murphs how i initially performed the murph as one of variations

performing each murph as above in a repeating week cycle pullups were strict my shoulders would not have been able to cope with kipping pullups i completed all the mile runs on a treadmill except week when i was on holiday i built a homegym in november but continued visiting my commercial gym for the murphs until i bought a treadmill in january i could have run outside but i live on a busy main road and running a mile would have meant being delayed while waiting at various traffic lights if this triggers the murph police to mobilise and invalidate the week challenge fuck em deviations week

this took just under hours and minutes and was an impulsive competitive response to uia_egg completing murphs cheers mate it was also pretty fucking horrific i did weeks and barefoot diet and weight from july to november i cut weight using unsuns tdee spreadsheet and went from lbs to lbs eating mainly oats yoghurt chicken fish steak rice and veggies protein shakes while the murphs didnt necessarily get easier my running speed and overall endurance improved and the pullups were far less taxing on my body however my upper body lifts which hadnt been affected by the injury really began to take a nosedive if id maintained the lowest weight of lbs until the end of the challenge my murph pr times would most likely have been lower but as my injury finally cleared up around december my goals and priorities shifted as my squat and deadlift numbers began moving closer to preinjury levels and i began eating whatever i liked despite my weight increasing ive still been hitting murph prs up until week as of today im up to lbs i dont drink alcohol prs murph slowest fastest weightedunpartitioned weightedpartitioned unweightedunpartitioned unweightedpartitioned heres the spreadsheet with all timings body composition pics please note these pics are not the result of murphs alone i was running the weekly murph alongside days lifting and additional running im not on trt nor do i use peds june august december april may notes and thoughts murph quickly became a selfflagellating part of my weekly regimen although the yearlong challenge might appear daft on paper the reality was i had to work hard for less than an hour a week and it quickly became apparent this wasnt an endurance challenge more a singleminded exercise in discipline having said that there were times i pondered my hubris and thought why the fuck am i doing this fortunately posting weekly updates in rweightroom kept me accountable there seemed to be no discernible pattern to how well or how badly i performed overall i could feel great before starting but get a poor time i could feel shit or exhausted or hungry before i started but then manage to shave minutes off previous prs id hit prs with tired legs on days that immediately followed heavy squats or deadlifts or would maddeningly miss prs despite feeling fresh from the previous day of complete rest id keep an eye on the timer during partitioned murphs and know at the halfway point if i was in with a decent chance of beating the previous pr only to push a little too hard and just not have quite enough in the tank to run the final mile fast enough it was a baffling inexact science during one of the weighted unpartitioned murphs midchallenge it felt like i was beginning to develop tendonitis in my arms but fortunately this cleared up i had toyed with the idea of maybe celebrating the completion of the weeks with a weighted unpartitioned murph every day for a week or maybe a hour murph but as i inched closer towards the end of the challenge i realised that volume of pullups would be problematic and would likely cause injury about weeks ago i completely abandoned the idea ive since found out theres recently been a few people whove run unweighted murph every day for a month challenges but these have generally invoked the wrath of rcrossfit as a stupid idea and muh rhabdo my best most consistent results for partitioned were by doing sets of i tried sets of and while achievable i needed more time to recover between sets unweighted i built to the point where i was able to consistently get through the sets with little if any breaks between sets i had to keep a written tally midmurph otherwise id forget which set i was on because numbers is hard i switched from day full body bbbbbs to day bbbbbs at the end of june with the intention of adding more running to the upper body days to coincide with the previously mentioned weight cut in feb i began stronger by sciences average to savage day rtf variant im currently just over the midway point my weekly runs average km and i also occasionally add in hill sprints conditioning stamina and overall endurance improved when i started the murphs i had to plan my days around them as id be pretty wiped out afterwards once i got a few months into the challenge id feel recovered within a few minutes there was a definite carryover to my lifting with much reduced rest times between sets pushups adding to weekly chest volume and an increase in ability to push harder on amrap sets notable recent amrap sets on average to savage have included deadlift kg x bench kg x standing abwheel rollouts x murph tips ymmv i wasted money on unsuitable weighted vests one that went up to kg was far too constrictive around the torso and looked like something a suicide bomber might wear and a cheap ebay kg one whose fasteners broke after a couple of weeks around week i bit the bullet and bought a more pricey heavy duty one from bulldog uk that has been comfortable durable and well worth the money if youre going to be doing weighted murphs or indeed anything that requires a weighted vest wvs are a fantastic conditioning tool its a false economy to buy cheap shit i was told that running with a weighted vest would definitely fuck up my jointsbackankles it didnt if youre unsure whether your body parts can tolerate the addition of kglbs try running with lighter weights and build up if youre fearful of trying that theres nothing to stop your murph being unweighted it will still be a murph take that first mile easy if you get to the pullups puffing panting and breathing out of your arse youre going to need longer recoveryrest times i found my sweet spot for the first mile to be around kph around m mile unweighted and around kph around m mile for weighted also for partitioned if youre going for a pr dont expend any unnecessary energy or time by wandering around be efficient drop from the pullups do the pushups stand up and do the squats rather than holding your breath and bracing for the pushups and squats which you may have a tendency to do automatically try to maintain a natural breathing rhythm and dont go balls to the wall with the reps if you slow them down and breathe naturally without exhaling on every rep youll gas less quickly edit for clarity if youre squatting with a barbell you absolutely hold your breath and brace do not breathe naturally if you are squatting with weights for the unpartitioned sets dont take the pullups and pushups to failure otherwise youll need longer recoveryrest times for the unpartitioned weighted squats i found best results from doing restpausing then longer rest then repeat unweighted i built up to on the first set followed by a then for the remainder for the final mile your legs are likely to be wobbly as fuck at first making you feel as elegant as a horse on iceskates start as slow as necessary but ramp it up and push that last half mile like a mofo sprint finish if you can if you begin to feel like you are becoming champion of the murphs check out this year old badass tldr old bloke gave it some welly and did a thing for a year
38dyy5,Fitness,2015-06-03 16:20:52,month progress i wanted to post a month progress but had my gall bladder removed in april so i was kind of set back a month so here is my very short and quick month progress pics male lbs lbs at my highest point i was lbs i lost a few pounds just by not eating as much junk but not really tracking anything then in april of last year i got more serious with dieting and working out diet was pretty much a straight iifym diet tracked with myfitnesspal started at about calroie deficit initially then decreased the deficit to about towards the end watched calories and i tried to get protein to about grams then after that didnt worry too much about carbs and fats workout was pretty much all weight lifting with no cardio outside of regular daily type stuff playing with kids occasional bike ride or walk with dog houseyard work weekly softball game i started out with a phul routine but ended up switching to a ppl routine would go about days a week depending on schedule married with kids so couldnt always just set specific days and times for the gym it was just go when i could kind of thing i never once tried for max lifts would just addreduce weight depending on how my last workout was actually had several times of negative progress most likely because of being on a pretty decent deficit now that im down and will be going into a maintenance and eventually a bulk i will be doing more with actually tracking the progress of my lifts do have a fair amount of loose skin in my chest stomach and legs the legs are actually the worst area have a lot of loose skin hanging around my thighsbutt area you can see some in the chest i dont like it but its not as bad as it could have been my stomach you cant see the worst of it as my shorts hide it pretty well but its definitely there especially on the lower abs that ab shot in the bathroom is in part due to some generous lighting edit too hard to go through and reply to every comment so thank you so much for the compliments and encouragement i was honestly still very selfconscious about my body and this has made me feel really good edit some replies to some questions ive gotten asked several times the app for the workout routine is jefit should be getting some royalties or something for the amount of times ive recommended them now the skin for right now im not really doing anything about the loose skin its still too early i will have to give my skin some time to see how much it might rebound naturally in the mean time im going to work on adding some lean muscle to fill in the space i dont know if its bad enough to justify the cost of surgery down the road it wouldnt be covered by my insurance and i dont have that kind of cash lying around my routine yeah its a lot of volume and i dont do a set progression or anything basically i have a range of target reps usually for big excercises and then for accessory types i will basically go to failure or just short of failure on every set of every exercise if its too easy i go up in weight if i dont make my target range i go back down sometimes it ends up looking like a reverse pyramid type of program i received a lot of other questions i could post a followup thread in a week or so with more answers to people with questions if anyone would be interested in that also maybe post a few more pics espeically of the loose skin since a lot of people want to know about that reply or message me if that would actually interest anyone i didnt think that people would be so interested or even impressed with this but i definitely would love to help anyone possible so bring it on

legs because theyve come the furthest haha full liftingnutrition details at the bottom hey guys ive been lurking rfitness off and on since before the first day ever stepping foot inside a gym and i thought maybe my story could be interesting to a few of you i notice we get a lot of posts about people who were playing video games all day and ended up quitting that to pursue a healthy gym life totally cool but my story is a little different i actually got more dedicated to my love of video games during my fitnesslife transformation so i want to give hope to people who think its an eitheror decision at the time of writing this im the rd ranked achievement hunter in the world on pc steam over achievements earned over games complete and have had a wide variety of success including a few dozen guinness world record book appearances xboxplaystation world championship victories getting my own official video game trading card and various other nerd stuff like getting some articles written about me for a hoursstraight marathon session which resulted in a world first for borderlands since this is an rfitness post i dont want to dwell on the nonfitness parts of it but totally willing to talk more about it in the comments if you guys are interested i think it is an important part of my story to make clear though i got way better and more accomplished at video games after starting my fitness journey in fact i gave a talk at one of the big gaming conventions pax about how i feel gamers are supercharged potential ready to be unleashed on fitness success one of my main goals is to show other people like me that they have this power inside anyways i grew up very small and skinnyfat reaching a peak of lbs as an adult after being in the low something lbs range through high school somehow not that lean of a because i grew up never playing a single sport orgoing outside and instead spent my developmental years glued to runescape world of warcraft halo etc before lifting so many people told me i had to quit playing video games all the time and start going to the gym and i gave a big hell no to that it wasnt until my third year of college that my formerlyoverweight best friend tried lifting weights and convinced me to give it a shot he basically said dude check out rfitness and try starting strength and i was on my way this was mid first day in the gym was a confusing nightmare i was googling what does a barbell look like and similar questions from my phone desperately trying to figure out what was going on i still have a picture of a squat rack from the very first time in the gym which i sent to someone to ask what it was my starting lifts were basically lbs or slightly more i will forever remember failing x on overhead press and having to try some lighter dumbbells to get the motion down needless to say i was very weak and had a long road ahead i ended up alternating between a day with squatoverhead pressdeadlift and a day with squatbench pressassisted pullups sometimes throwing in a few curls or something basic minimalist linear progression with barbells xweek i had help and motivation from a few cool internet people like umythicalstrength and was on my way this is my first after picture the strongest and most fit ive ever been in my life yikes eventually i started getting pretty burned out and realizing that i needed to do something more fun i started doing which introduced the startling concept ofdoing more than reps of an exercise needless to say the adjustment was brutal haha and it was definitely the right move amrap sets were a huge motivator for me and i made an excel spreadsheet with a full list of all my best reps at each weight best sets of x etc after that i rotated through a few powerliftingspecific programs and worked my numbers up to a something bench something squat and just over deadliftthen totally lost motivation at the beginning of didnt really make any progress that year heres me in getting ready to set goals again as you can see ive put on a ton of mass from where i startedbut a lot of it still not good haha i stuck to barbells as a foundation again with almost the exact same program i started with in then switched to the phat template and learned a ton of new exercises for the first time building toward looks as a primary goal seemed like a cool thing to do rather than obsessing over the barbell numbers as my only metric for success my motivation was very off and on and the big long term goal and my discipline toward it was the only thing that kept me on track most of the time eventually i switched over to some basic pushpulllegs action and modified that completely by feel sometimes id do sets of sometimes id do a bunch of sets of and so on but usually ill gravitate these days to sets of for my main work maybe s or s for certain stuff heres me now after all that sitting right at lbs example template for the workouts exercises would be worked on with increasing weight or reps each time until i dont feel like the following session would be productive to attempt this loss of rep quality or just running myself too hard into a wall and then rotated out for another variation another strategy i may use is to reduce the weight of an exercise every single week but increase the sets and reps nothing groundbreaking but i spent so long desperately trying to increase the weight every single time that it took me a while to realize all these other options haha heres a recent example of how my days on day off rotation looks push barbell incline up to a heavy set of then lighter x dumbbell ohp x rope pushdowns x overhead rope extensions x side raises x dips xfailure pull deadlift x tbar rows x seated rows x rear flyes x face pulls x lat pulldowns x preacher curls x legs squat x leg press x leg extension x leg curls x calf raises x dumbbell curls x yes i know this isnt legs but its a major weakpoint haha biggest struggles mistakes lessons consistency lots of onoff cycles of going super hard then not at all in i feel like i finally for the first time in my life locked into a firm unwavering dedication to a fitnessbased future and am feeling accepting about the ups and downs in the process understanding that not every week or month will have dedication is a huge part of fitness for me because beating myself up too much about it will surely lead to crashing and burning balance not like balancing on a tightrope but i mean balancing the effort you put into your workouts ive had bad habits of dumping of my energy in the first exercise or two and then neglecting the rest and then years later tried to correct it by putting way too little effort into my exercises in fear of not finishing the workout strong with good reps of course i then figured out that the answer is somewhere in between hit your main movements hard but with a smart plan and then attack your assistance movements with sufficient ferocity as well they matter a lot more than i realized nutrition ive struggled a lot with eating properly throughout my life and i neglected it for a very long time for most of my time lifting i was basically cramming myself with whatever easy fast food i could find just desperately fixated on putting in more calories and gaining more muscle and adding more strength i even did gallon of milk per day for a month early on haha i started to find pretty good success with the iifym style eating a lot of unhealthy foods but at least intelligently chosen junk for lack of a better phrase haha but my results were very slow and very strengthbased eat whatever i need to get my squat to go up even if i gain some fat so as my goals shift my nutrition has shifted to roughly the following for now and obviously adjustments are made updown depending on goal and results am eggs sliced turkey toast packet of flavored oatmeal am cereal whey shake usually i dont use protein powder but started to now preworkout like this am start sipping on a g carb shake lots of brand options go with taste preference haha pm some kind of meat maybe chicken or tilapia rice some cashews some veggies pm some kind of meat maybe salmon or steak potatoes and a small salad pm greek yogurt and nuts quantities are adjusted up and down but right now thatll put me around g pro g carb g fat this is the most protein and least fat ive ever had in my life for what its worth im liking it current goals making fat loss a focus while trying to slowly improve strength then add some mass to these arms and back kind of vague i know but my main goals end up being simple stuff like i want to do all these reps again but lbs more on the bar next time keeps me focused phew well i think that covers the main details so far please dont hesitate to ask if youre curious about any more details or info this is the first time writing a transformation post haha and id like to say thanks to you all to rfitness but just to everyone who has that calling to ask questions and share answers with each other with the purpose of us all collectively growing without internet communities like this one i know that i never would have gotten myself

share my story with you all and hopefully inspire some of you to take control of your life and pursue fitness and confidence below i share my beginning and current stats along with information about the dieting protocol i utilized along with exercise protocol i experienced with please feel free to comment and i will do my best to answer more questions if the interest is there fitness has changed my life growing up i was bullied mercilessly i still remember times when i was strangled in public and no one stood up for me i was laughed at and beat up so many times was the youngest in my class for the majority of my childhood years and also one of the skinniest i was suicidal and severely depressed up until my early teen years i began working out in my room when i was around with just a pushup set and no idea how to train but as i pursued fitness i realized that it was a venue for me to rise above and become someone who i wanted to be outgoing confident energetic positive and happy it has brought me all those and more my physique began to transform and when i turned and entered college i began pursuing it as a lifestyle it had developed into a passion i also got nasmcertified at and began training clients of all ages developing great relationships and having the opportunity to change lives through training like i never would have imagined however up until last year i was still in a mental shell i suffered from severe social anxiety and would get panic attacks when i was in certain situations and deciding whether or not to attend a social event i grew up in a very traditional asian family and was cultured to be afraid of the world this past year i pushed myself to attend huge raves solo and sober and forced myself to meet new people as i always wanted to experience the scene i love edm i documented some of it in the video and hope it can inspire some of you all out there these were some of the most exhilarating experiences of my life next steps starting a youtube channel and inspiring and reaching more people through fitness has been a dream of mine the past few years and is the next step for me i have been approached by many people regarding fitness so i feel a big calling to start a channel to share my journey and want to encompass fitness confidence and progressing in life my goal through fitness is not just to improve myself but also to impact change and inspire others to pursue fitness and a happier life in the future i would like to open my own gym and may try my hand at competing in the npc or in powerlifting competitions i am also developing my training business as i have had success training clients in person and am branching out in the los angeles area i may pursue further schooling in the future for physical therapy or medicine due to school these past few years i did not feel i could commit fully to developing a quality channel i busted my butt in college and achieved high honors but now i am pursuing this endeavor to hopefully inspire more people throughout the world through my passion for fitness here are the stats to my transformation and my info beginning weight height and age lbs

of sports medicine cpt ces fns bachelor of science phi beta kappa in human biology exercise physiology fitness model with naturally fit agency owner at davidwangfitness detailed diet and exercise routine history consistently tracking macros for days straight at this point and modifying as necessary in the beginning i was extremely strict with my diet eating every hours packing a massive cooler with me to work daily and was even ridiculed for doing this but it helped me stay on track towards my fitness goals i have learned a lot through education since this point and how to modify my diet further to adjust to situations but meal prepping and sticking to whole foods the majority of the time has been a big part of my diet plan calories consumed from i consumed around calories a day as this allowed me to make significant noob gains however i modified my caloric intake as i saw fit based on my progress if my weight was stalling or i was not seeing strength gains i slightly increased my calories to allow for a slightly greater surplus however i aimed to always stay fairly lean i gauged this by my overall definition mostly abs and weight if i wanted to get leaner i tracked macros and adjusted accordingly to allow for a caloric deficit and gauged progress by weight and how i looked supplements consumed whey protein creatine beta alanine fish oil bcaas multivitamin all natural stuff i have never used a preworkout in my life as i feel these are unnecessary and often have a ton of stimulants like caffeine and ingredients and can cause dependency i zone in for my training sessions minutes before i train and meditate visualizing success and preparing for intensity the mind and focusing on your training goals to me is far more powerful than a preworkout supplement programs followed when i first began training before i had no knowledge whatsoever about program designwould knock out tons of pushups in my room led to shoulder impingement and elbow tendonitis from improper training not enough pulling to balance the pushing this made me start learning how to train smart and helped me develop a passion for the body i currently structure my own training split as i have found what works best for my body which is dup daily undulating periodization style training however around years old i trained for athletics and plyometrics following volume and explosive based training for basketball then i began similar protocol to starting strength to build strength but stuck with lower reps for big compounds and hypertrophy rep ranges for accessories over time i developed more knowledge and began modifying rep ranges for strength and hypertrophy protocol based on my progress and goals today i primarily stick with dup beginning stats for bench squat and deadlift bench lbs for rep squat lbs for x superset with stepups x deadlift lbs current stats for bench squat and deadlift bench i typically stick with incline bench for for repsx or so due to bench

1k9oo35,mentalhealth,2025-04-28 06:07:54,i never feel emotionally safe or happy i feel no connection with anyone or anything anymore everything feels empty and meaningless no matter how good my husband treats me i dont feel happy and i dont feel safe i was previously married for years and my ex was emotionally unavailable emotionally and mentally abusive controlled everything i did brainwashed me forcibly created a parental dynamic with me but i was the one always working and keeping a job and working on the marriage and towards a future i had to be the adult with everything despite him being some years older than me but he was the only person i initially ever trusted in my life because we shared the same things we enjoyed on a deeper emotional level but this was really all we connected with anything outside of this was basically worthless and he would never work with me on anything at all my life before him was also bad i basically have no family my parents are shit and i really have no other family my grandparents who raised me all have passed away within the past or so years so i have no other family no matter what i do now to try to be happy i am unable to my husband treats me well works with me supports me and is loving and caring towards me i moved countries to be with him any issues we have we try to communicate and work on things we both live alone together in our own apartment i moved from the usa to be with him we live in germany but no matter what i feel empty inside and like nothing matters anymore i dont find joy in anything i try to enjoy things and do better but im always tired i feel no emotional connection to anything everything feels empty example i remember when i was younger i used to be able to go to sleep by myself and daydream myself to sleep daydreaming about things i like enjoying fantasies by myself and it would be comforting and self soothing this type of behavior had always in the past helped me with my mental health and perseverance i was creative and happy no matter what was going on around me i would draw and make friends online enjoy my hobbies work towards goals etc and now i just dont care anymore i see no point in it all when i was with my ex i was really looking towards a future with him because of creative aspects about him but his own severe fear of losing me made our marriage impossible as it caused him to be unnecessarily controlling abusive and manipulative but he was the only person i had known at the time that i initially put all my trust into even though my husband i have now treats me so much better i dont feel any joy no i wasam not addicted to the ups and downs of what i had when i was married to my ex i never have really experienced that i think what i was more so focused on back then i think was hope he was the first person i ever fully trusted and he destroyed it himself for no good reason i felt initially like i was important to him and mattered and that we had a future together because i could tell how much i made him happy but his own issues made him abusive and he could never connect with me on a deeper level but i still felt like there was more meaning in our marriage than what many others had its just that i was the main one giving and he couldnt reciprocate in ways that were meaningful to me and i know he didnt want to lose me admitting to me that i was all he had and i was the only thing that made him happy even with what im writing i can say that ive moved on more than it seems but i dont understand why nothing feelings meaningful to me anymore

1k9jsrs,mentalhealth,2025-04-28 01:22:54,i had a full on mental breakdown and now im afraid of myself the other day i was fully making plans to commit suicide long story short i have an extreme amount of stress in my life my daughter has level autism and ive had nearly a decade of dealing with things that i am not equipped to handle screaming in our face smearing poop on the walls screaming for hours if we accidentally do something that upsets her like tell her happy birthday theres no telling what will upset her a lot of the time its beyond what most people are equipped to handle and my husband and i both struggle a lot however another layer is that i have ctd and am often in pain my daughter is very strong and when i have to restrain her as gently as possible while shes screaming in my face its not only very triggering but difficult physically we also have an year old son who just has to deal with it the best he can i grew up in an abusive household i have a long history of abuse her screaming is incredibly triggering i usually disassociate as best as i can but as shes gotten bigger its much harder because shes louder and more destructive well my husband has said in the last confided in me when he has felt suicidal he has said it would be better if humanity never existed at all blah blah blah he is atheist and im spiritualpray to jesus he has been very critical of that its hard to talk to anyone because so many people couldnt understand when ive taken it to god in the past my husband has criticized me heavily i feel so trapped and helpless sometimes my husband is a great dad loves the kids and feels especially close to our daughter even though shes broken him in ways as well he just wants to protect her but at the same time hes said before that he wishes he were dead i cannot get a job because if my daughter had to be watched i couldnt find anyone to do it we live in the country and the government wants to me find someone to watch her for an hour for respite i can find someone for around an hour not its almost comical how little the tx government offers to help so anyway cant get a typical job so im in college but i have to watch her by myself all summer and im so nervous i have final exams coming up and the summer to look forward to on friday i finally mentally broke i tried to convince my husband that we should kill ourselves with helium and a whole plan to have his mother take over parenting i was very serious and almost delirious in my acceptance of this plan of mine i felt relief my husbands reaction of shock and anger scared me and i was so sure in my mind that hed want to looking back im like yeah duh but i completely shut down thought id just do it to myself then started planning my own plan for myself the next day i just stopped responding to my husband and kids couldnt find it in me to say anything my husband finally talked me into sanity again but now im completely terrified of myself i dont know what to do or who to talk to i have never had a breakdown that extreme before
1k9jh6v,mentalhealth,2025-04-28 01:05:25,i dont know whether im dead or alive i dont know if this is the right subreddit and this is my first time posting on reddit despite lurking for years throwaway account so apologies if i fuck anything up i uk last december had tried to kill myself for the th time while rather drunk and had the worst experience out of all ive tried but assumed it was just that and i lived however about months later i realised that things were only the way they were becoming because i was dead and this was hell since when i took what i used to try and kill myself after a bit i was going in and out of a semi unconscious state and dreaming of things and when i woke up properly i was in hell for surely thats the only way everything wrong with the world is so bad it was bad when i was alive but it suddenly got so much worse after i died and i have done more than enough to cause me to go to hell whats more is i feel very very dead im not sure how to describe it but i do remember when i was cremated i was at an event and suddenly i smelled burning and it terrified me because i guessed id be out of the morgue by now and this was it later i was relieved to find theyd just burnt bread but then i realised it was metaphorical rather than literal since bread is commonly used to symbolise flesh because of the bible and jesus and since they burnt bread it actually meant my body was being cremated thus removing any opportunity for coming back its funny because im not religious at all im very anti religion to be honest but i still cannot shake the feeling im dead despite my friend telling me he doubted what i took would kill anyone since he took more and supposedly lived if he isnt just another hell clone trying to torment me and now maybe more months later i am not sure whether i am dead or alive things were already headed in an awful place before i died i could see it all lined up and its just continued as i expected it to since then and i worry because my mother had paranoid schizophrenia and starting around or maybe even earlier but only actually kicking off at i began to hallucinate mostly calmed down now apart from occasional bad times and shortly after id have delisuons the first one i remember being that everyone could read my mind and the one that keeps popping up is that certain people and once everyone is spying on me for a team of psychiatrists who are trying to get me locked up i dont know what to do i dont think i can do anything either i cant talk to anyone due to my own fear caused by bad experiences with people working in psychiatry and because theyll tell my father and he really doesnt take that stuff well hes better than other parents usually but if its too severe he gets upset with me and i cant escape that and i have no one online or irl who will say anything to me or express any opinion on this or they just tell me its weird and to stop

1k8wk32,mentalhealth,2025-04-27 05:25:52,need advice on starting therapy or pretherapy jumping off points ive battled depression and anxiety for over half my life now and after it culminating in a suicide attempt in i had some major life changes including living in group homes and similar housing and not working for about years before more recently feeling id improved enough to move states closer to friends and get probably the best job ive had not a high bar to meet at all so im now living on my own and paying all my own expenses again pog the only problem is ive almost completely reverted if not worse in terms of mental health and life habits to the point that im pretty sure im actively lowering my future life expectancy and general health every day i go on without making positive changes im rapidly becoming miserable and have reached an age where i can no longer get away with completely ignoring my own bodys well being not that you can ever really get away with that however an extreme degree of mental inertia combined with my depressionanxiety and negative personality traits makes me know from past experiences with myself that its very unlikely for me to drag myself up out of this pit by myself the obvious starting choice is a mental health professionaltherapist but i really cant afford it and at this point i dont even know how much i need a licensed therapist when in a lot of cases i know things i should be doing its just all so much and i get so overwhelmed that i cant even begin such that i suspect merely being able to have an extended discussion about all this where i can verbalize it and have someone suggest a concrete plan or even just reasonable starting points would be enough does that make any sense i know im describing therapy almost exactly but hear me out like if just as an example i hypothetically spent every waking moment of both leisure and work time laying in bed on my laptop itd stand to reason that one clear element i should focus on is reintroducing regular physical activity into my routine since that has welldocumented wideranging mental health benefits that doesnt necessarily take a therapist so much as a willing and dedicated conversation partner and while in a perfect world id just get both by picking a talented therapist i wondered if anyone had any positive experiences with other hopefully freer options that might fit a situation like mine where i plan to attend therapy but cost is a big factor and in the immediate present i just need someone to help enable me to begin change at all im willing to explore pretty much anything but if it requires much money or cant be accessed online the chances of me utilizing it drop to nearzero thank you for any input

1k9ns8i,mentalhealth,2025-04-28 05:08:53,how to know if its interns syndrom or something serious stpd so looked something up and went oh shit i do that its schitotypical personality disorder i want to bring it up with my therapist or my mom but im worried it might just be interns syndrom learning about something and thinking you have it i am not asking for a diagnosis just opinions if i bring it up it would seem very sudden because i dont really talk to other about my magical thinking or ideas of reference which i do quite often and i heard that most people with this disorder tend to not get help however i think i do match some symptoms i have no close friends none of them really know everything about me they do not know what i did or what i was like before highschool the ones that have meet be before highschool i no longer talk to i feel very uncomfortable getting close with other and i often feel like i do not know how i have ideas of reference especially when driving certain songs i can not play when its snowing i can not play blood on the snow ill interpret the songs and how my day will go more birds outside the better my day will be etc magical thinking if i think of a scenario it wont happen so i think of every scenario so it doesnt happen i wont use a certain light because idk demon i guess something in the vents and it watches oh yeah fucking vent noises and feeling like im being watched when im home alone i may or may not have a sword next to my bed because of this home alone i stay upstairs because there are too many windows for someone to peek through downstairs i am always looking to see if someone is looking through the windows thats why i always close my curtians one time i was carrying my longsword around the house bc i was scared someone else was there one time i got really stressed and thought that one of my friends siblings didnt exist and thought that i could see through the threads of the universe but that was two hours tops omfg randomly everything will feel like the wrong size and it will make me wanna scream like the world is big and small other time i thought that people were going to break into my house through my window i live on the second floor wait no i heard two people talking thats why half of the time the only person that can understand what i mean is my closest friends and my mom like i wont have the vocabulary to say it so it comes out kinda fragmented and i use synonyms instead of the actual word i need to use weirdness idk i wear all black and a leather jacket bc thats fun im also a furry so thats it i do tarot cards i mean im fine tho like this stuff isnt often especially hearing random voices stuff definitely not often i dont have anxiety anymore because im on lexapro cuz i got diagnosed with anxiety altho it is starting to creep back sorry its so long lol i just have a lotta thoughts

1k9kb69,mentalhealth,2025-04-28 01:50:18,need help with my partners teenage daughter for context my partners daughter is she has never had a relationship with her father and i am concerned for her well being i met my daughter about years ago and quickly noticed something seemed off about her daughter she dropped out of high school so has no qualifications makes little to no effort to leave the house always seems to lack energy motivation and we have to encourage her to shower and do really basic things i understand mental health is clearly at play here and have her booked to see a doctor i sympathize with her but it can be frustrating living alongside it she seems to have the mental maturity of a young child she is extremely untidy and has to be reminded to do the most normal of things she hasnt brushed her teeth in years constantly leaves unfinished plates of food at the table her clothes all over the floor and honestly i am not sure what to do about it it isnt my daughter so i dont want to over step my boundaries i have encouraged my partner to try and convince her to go to college but she is reluctant to put pressure on her she doesnt communicate very well there is times i will try and speak to her and she will just ignore me its like the lights are on but nobody is home she refuses to engage with society when we go out for instance if we go to mcdonalds my partner has to order her food and speak for her she simply refuses to interact or communicate with other humans on the contrary she is never off her phone seems extremely confident if you didnt know her but watched her tiktoks i feel her phone has completely desensitized her to real life and disabled her ability to learn real life or communication skills so where would you go from here i know she is nearly but i feel she is more like a year old and i dont want to encourage things she is just not fit for though i do worry and wonder where does she go with her future if she just refuses to engage or put herself out there she already has no qualifications and college seems improbable she did say she wants a job to make money but that would involve her speaking to a stranger and attending a job interview which she will just refuse to do her sleep routine is awful she stays up all night and sleeps throughout the day then gets up and stays in her pyjamas for days on end sorry for the long post i just could do with some advice me and my partner argue about this a lot as my partner seems to want to continue to baby her whilst i am thinking about the fact that she has to face up to the real world sooner or later

1k9hnlw,mentalhealth,2025-04-27 23:31:35,my teenager is having a mental health crisis and i have no idea what to do okay bit of a warning this situation is really complex and is the result of many years of events i have done my best to include all relevant details but i apologize if i have left something out me f and my husband m were recently appointed guardianship of his little sister f and it has been quite an adjustment as you can probably imagine she has been living with us for around months due to her being removed from her parents care and we were awarded emergency guardianship at that time pending a formal hearing without going into too much detail she ended up with us due to some concerning allegations she made against her father and we have a criminal case pending against him for that her mother has chosen not to believe her and stands with her husband which is why she did not retain custody of her daughter this was an immensely difficult situation to manage me and my husband had been no contact with his parents for a couple of years prior to all of this for our own reasonsconflicts we had with them that i have talked about a little bit in a previous post we had not seen his sister in person since before we got married in and had no contact with her at all until the beginning of when she got his number out of her mothers phone now with that background out of the way onto the current crisis since she has been living with us she has made so much progress we enrolled her in school and she previously had never been in a structured school environment she has made tons of friends which somewhat baffles me as someone who has always been very introverted she has gotten really close with members of my family including my mom dad and younger brother by all accounts she has been adjusting really well or so we thought i got a call from her counselor a few days ago that i needed to come up to her school to have a chat when i got there they informed me that she received an email from one of her teachers that they had overheard her talking with another student about ending her own life the counselors preformed a risk assessment and determined that she needed to be evaluated by mental professionals asap so we took her to a facility and they recommended we get her into their inpatient program that runs for about weeks and then she goes mondayfriday during the day for two weeks then it goes down to times a week we are obviously devasted that she is experiencing these issues and take it very seriously the main issue is we have not been able to get her on our health insurance yet something that we are now trying to fast track these programs are very very expensive and me and my husband cannot afford it not sure how much it would be with insurance but the woman we spoke with made it sound like it was very expensive either way another big issue we have is that we are not parents we do not have kids of our own and we have no experience raising children so we are really just trying to figure it out as we go i guess i just dont know what to do i feel like we were dropped onto to an island with no tools and were told to figure out how to survive does anyone have any tips on how to help her or anything we can do any resources anything at all would be greatly appreciated

1k9de26,mentalhealth,2025-04-27 20:17:42,i thought rocking back and forth was harmless until it started controlling me i have been rocking back and forth since i was years old it has become a real problem now at post hi everyone i hope youre doing well im posting here because i really need advice and insight since i was about years old i started rocking back and forth while sitting down not fast just at a medium pace i dont know why i started but it gave me a sense of deep peace and calm my mom once took me to a doctor and the doctor said that as long as it made me feel safe it wasnt a big problem but honestly im not so sure anymore as i grew up i never really stopped rocking in first and second grade i would even rock during class later i learned to suppress it in public but at home or in safe places where no one judged me i kept doing it over the years more reasons piled up it helps me relax mentally it helps me think and process my thoughts better it keeps me from feeling bored when im sitting and doing nothing but now at its seriously affecting my life when i study i rock automatically and it completely destroys my concentration its like my brain cant focus because part of it is busy with the rocking i end up needing hours just to study what should normally take much less time even worse its affecting my body functions because my mind is so focused on rocking my body doesnt feel fully relaxed and that impacts natural processes like bowel movements i sometimes have to shift my sitting position to even be able to go ive realized that i dont rock when im deeply focused on something else like eating writing watching an intense movie or having a conversation its like my mind forgets to rock when its fully busy but otherwise the rocking feels almost impossible to stop ive tried forcing myself to stop but its like a powerful urge honestly it feels like an addiction its scary now im really worried about my future what if this behavior continues into adulthood what if it keeps sabotaging my ability to study work or even enjoy life normally im reaching out for real advice real guidance i would deeply appreciate hearing from people who have gone through something similar or even from experts who understand these kinds of repetitive behaviors if you have any tips exercises success stories or just encouragement it would mean the world to me i dont want this to control my life anymore i want to live fully and freely like anyone else thank you so much for reading im grateful for any help you can give me hashtags stimming mentalhealth bfrb focus selfgrowth

1k9bjmv,mentalhealth,2025-04-27 18:58:56,what to do with my brother and mother hi i have a pleaquestion as the title says i will chance names and ages since our situation is kind of recognizable to those who know us and well almost everyone in our circle use reddit i m have a brother m whom is depressed enough to have unaliving thoughts it all started when our father died due to covid almost at the start of the lockdowns were not a very close family were mostly by ourselves most of the time and when we do spend family time is mostly watching some anime or going to the movies thats important since we dont know how to communicate that effectively between us also theres something else thats hugely relevant we have a dog she helped us far more than each other to get through our father death and in fact i suspect the only reason why my brother is still alive is due to our dog now my brother have major depressive social anxiety inferiority complex he was diagnosed about years ago almost and was in treatment during the whole time with therapy and drugs i dont have many more details because i was struggling with my own attempts to unalive myself im already fine i choose to go to therapy by myself he many time feels worthless and he regularly said it back then something like we invite him to play something and he says no because he is the worst although now he doesnt say it as often he still acts like that now my mom is the kind of controlling woman in some aspects more than others for example when we dont to something she insists to the point is tiresome like she comes and say us do x thing and even before we can get up from the couch shes already telling us again so not even two seconds i know that were difficult in that aspect but as someone that has lived with that more than anyone i know how it feels and what it causes when she does that i actively want to not do it and my brother is the same and ive already tested it with my brother a few times when she is insisting that he gets out of bed like every seconds or so he can last there up to an hour yet when i stop her at the very beginning he doesnt get up immediately but in like minutes he does even without anyone telling him anything a few weeks back she went to our aún to spend the night religious thing and she told me to make him get up by well i did not and by he was already up and had his medicine also she always reprimand him about not putting enough effort for his recovery and while that is true she just dismisses everything he does do my brother of course always gets mad for that since he is indeed doing something im a doctor so i do have a good idea about mental health so ive already said to her that she must not do that since his diagnosis is that of inferiority complex that she just shrugs off his effort makes it worst plus i know how it feels she also does that to me i get that she is frustrated but i always tell her baby steps not perfection still she always gets more and more frustrated which i also understand the problem here is that since a few months when my brother does not do his steps for recovery and he fights with her she tells him that then she will not do anything else that he would be on his own and that its not worth her effort

1k96uhf,mentalhealth,2025-04-27 15:39:41,worried about my cousin sisters mental health and future need advice hi everyone im writing this because im really worried about my cousin sister and i would really appreciate any advice on what i can do to help her ill call her anna shes years old and currently in grade lately ive been very concerned about her mental health and how her childhood is shaping up and i dont want her to grow up carrying deep emotional wounds anna doesnt have any friends she had a few back in her earlier grades but after moving into a new class she started hating school and often complains that she has no one to sit with i think part of the problem is that anna is very raw and honest with people she says things very directly sometimes without realizing it might hurt others feelings i feel like other kids get weirded out by her behavior and start to avoid her to make things worse she comes from a very dysfunctional family her mom has a very high temper and is verbally abusive toward her for example once while brushing annas hair anna asked her mom to brush lighter and her mom snapped saying she would break her neck instead and then brushed even harder while it might be said in anger these kinds of interactions happen constantly and i can tell its taking a heavy toll on annas mental health its not that they dont love each other but the environment is very toxic for her anna also doesnt have the kind of childhood most kids should have she has no one to play with no hobbies and doesnt participate in any extracurricular activities so she has nothing to look forward to im currently preparing for my board exams so i cant spend too much time with her even though i try my best to make sure she doesnt feel lonely most of the time she just ends up coming into my room because she has nothing else to do because of all this anna has gotten heavily addicted to screens she spends most of her time either watching tv or staring at her phone her brother eventually set extremely strict limits only minutes per app but that only made her more frustrated and restless because she genuinely has nothing else to do sadly her brother also yells at her constantly for no reason and is very verbally abusive too anna absolutely hates him and i can see it damaging her selfesteem i once tried enrolling her in an extracurricular activity hoping it would help her make friends and find something she enjoys but her mom wasnt supportive she said she cant drop her off and pick her up im still trying to find ways to make it happen regardless out of everyone i think me and my sister are the closest to anna she has opened up to us a few times about how she feels once even saying that she often feels like crying shes not a bad kid at all shes very funny bright and full of potential when shes happy but im honestly scared that if things dont change shell grow up carrying serious emotional pain if anyone has advice on what i could do to help her even small things i would be really grateful thank you for reading

1k94x3h,mentalhealth,2025-04-27 14:14:29,i dont think ive ever felt worse at the end of i went through a very sudden outofnowhere breakup that was very painful to me that already hurt like hell and damaged my selfworth and then i decided to join a dating site about a year ago and i am still single the days where i swipe through idk whatever the limit of swipes is a day and get absolutely no matches are horrible i truly feel like an ugly troll and an unloveable hopeless piece of garbage especially when there are several of those days in a row but what makes it worse is that even when i do get matches of the time its the same story we talk for a while maybe exchange a few messages and then they ghost me to be clear im not sending anything inappropriate just talking about the normal stuff hobbies we have in common fun experiences weve had etc and then they just disappear sometimes i can kind of get it sometimes the conversation isnt running smoothly and we dont have that much in common and i can kind of understand like yeah maybe that wasnt working out but then there are other times where the conversation seems to be flowing we have a ton in common she seems to find what im saying interesting funny andor amusing and then suddenly poof shes gone never to be heard from again which makes me feel to say the least unloveable and hopeless i just wonder sometimes after this happens what is so wrong with me ive never been someone whos felt super attractive or anything like that ive had insecurities for a long time but man i feel truly awful after a year of this i feel like im hopeless and like i will never find anyone again like im the ugliest troll in the world a piece of garbage that nobody wants on the one hand you could say maybe you should stop using the dating apps then and i would happily do that if i had any other way to meet someone which i genuinely dont so i get to choose between either subjecting myself to this every day or just being alone for the rest of my life either option is awful but man unironically i cant do this anymore

1k915s2,mentalhealth,2025-04-27 10:48:36,am i too mentally ill to have a relationship hi this is my first time ever posting on reddit which is a sign for how desperate i am i think i wasnt sure which subreddit to post this on but i think this one is broad enough to fit my problem in however im not a reddit pro okay so me and my bf have been dating for exactly half a year tomorrow now were both and when we met we were both fresh out of school and it was summer and my mood was generally really good ive always struggled with mental health issues mainly ocd and anxiety since grade school im self diagnosed on those two but lets be real if you have it you know you have it those two sucked but they never caused an issue in my relationship how so the problem started to form when i went to university right before we got together i moved from my city which is pretty big to a smaller one with roughly k inhabitants which for me was basically a village especially cause my flatshare was located in the citys outskirts i knew noone there and this time made my mental health deteriorate pretty drastically i dont think i have depression but ive always had phases where i was generally depressed although before moving cities these were maybe a couple of days every few months not a week straight with maybe a day of happiness in between like then and also now i have moved back home since and am preparing to study at another university which is pretty hard cause i have no drive and feel numb pretty much all the time but we ball the main problem atm for me is the situation with my boyfriend i wanna keep this short but just know he is the loveliest person ever never fights usually very understanding we met in a video game and slowly started picking up contact till we met irl a few times and then started dating long distance about a hour train ride before i moved he knew me as a generally happy person i guess i was always the problem in our relationship but it was always small things that you can probably overlook it only started to get bad recently where my phases of being depressed started getting longer we call and play games together almost every night and i often kinda found myself not speaking and kinda clocking out of our conversations because i just couldnt get myself to talk where it gets really bad is when i start to get annoyed at every small thing he does sometimes something he does that isnt even wrong makes me go into full beat mode and i start to lash out on him start an unnecessary fight and am just generally very unfair and mean i know in the moment while its happening that it isnt right and i just keep going i pretty much apologize immediately everytime its happening but i know that doesnt fix things at all yesterday we had a very big argument that again i started and im not gonna go into details but it was really unnecessary i already looked into therapy for the first time ever but even if i get a spot now which obviously is not gonna happen i wont get better immediately i genuinely love my boyfriend so much and thats why i feel bad that he has to put up with me especially cause i feel like i could really try to be a better person more than i do now but its so hard i genuinely feel like he would be better off without me and have a more enjoyable life but i also know that i tend to be drastic thats why im asking reddit even tho i dont think anyone will even interact with this am i not fit to have a relationship at all or what should i do to to make this situation better

1k90zy2,mentalhealth,2025-04-27 10:37:43,can anyone explain hiding the reason behind emotions from an early age im not sure if this is the right subreddit but ive been trying to work out why this could be and wondered if theres any specific psychology behind it i distinctly remember being a child before i started school so at most watching a film about a girl and a fox and at the end the fox falls out a window and dies little me started sobbing but i was adamant it wasnt the emotional pain and so i made up that i had a tummy ache and that was what caused me to cry and that pretty much sums up the way ive been my whole life entirely unable to admit to emotion pain but why would yr old me feel the need to do that my home life wasnt difficult my parents were open about their feelings its been such a big barrier in my life and i would do anything to know why im like it

1k8xlif,mentalhealth,2025-04-27 06:36:53,i just found my brothers sucde note but hes still alive sorry for the flair they arent my own thoughts i am not sucdal for context my brother is and i am i posted on here a little bit ago about a note i saw on my little brothers phone while he left it open in front of me it was this weird paragraph talking in first person but written like the opening to ya novel and it was talking about self harm i was almost completely sure that it was something he wrote about himself because ive been noticing signs of depression in him and so has my mom who confirmed to me hed been cutting that paragraph has been really bothering me for a while so earlier today after he went to sleep i unlocked his phone and found it i know it was wrong of me to do this but i genuinely just could not get the paragraph out of my head i panicked when i first saw it and wrote my first post about it here and i have been worrying about his mental health more than i ever have but reading it confirmed to me that it was a preplanned suicide note its much longer now than it was when i first saw it and it talks about people he knows in real life and even talks about kllng himself directly its really in depth and talks about his struggles with people socially which ive noticed has gotten harder for him recently it lists a bunch of real people he seems to really hate and why he hates them im not mentioned in it at allhe inderectly mentions our parents when he talks briefly one sentence about how its difficult for him to see himself as a son to our parentsi dont know if that means i am a good figure in his life but i hope it does because i need to talk with him about his depression i dont know if i will mention seeing the note because that might embarrass him but still when i was his age even somewhat recently i used to write a lot of things that sounded like this but the fact that he self harms by cutting which i never did tells me he takes this much more seriously and i should genuinely be worried i think the bit about mentioning specific people he hates is more of a surface level primal expression of his general anger and dissatisfaction with his life which i understand he used to be very social but his friends have a lot of serious drama and hes going into high school and losing contact with a lot of his friends because of it i also blame unsupervised internet access which has definitely exposed him to some really dark concepts he never should have been exposed to this young im kind of looking for advice but im not sure on what to do other than have this talk with him and try to convince my mom to get him into therapy i need to find the right time to do it so it doesnt come up unnaturally and so i dont come on too strong because i dont want him to shut me out of his life especially not if hes struggling like this if i am one of the few role models in his life i need to take advantage of that and be a good one i know he still likes being around me and talking about things with me we have a lot in common and i really do love him and care about him i want the best for him and i think he really does still look up to me i honestly dont know why im even writing this i guess i just want some proof that im trying

1k90xby,mentalhealth,2025-04-27 10:32:45,i ate in peace for once for context i usually hear a quieter conversation level of the people near me during things like meals i honestly dont know if its real or not but its usually rather negative comments that drive me up a wall i generally just try to not react to that stuff in the moment i am aware i hallucinate sometimes due to things like multiple instances of seeing a cat and trying to pet it just to feel nothing where it was and still hearing people when no one was home no idea why it wasnt until i was confused by what sounded like someone else singing that i realised there was none of that going on during the meal last night it was actually just peaceful and enjoyable for once i cant name the last time it was like that to the point it was almost bizarre to think about it not happening i wish everything was that way

1k8zxcm,mentalhealth,2025-04-27 09:21:46,constantly ruminating and imagining my exhis friends are watching me i had a pretty bad breakup around months ago and i learnt a lot about my ex after the relationship namely how much of a liar he was throughout the relationship he kept me distanced from his friends and never formally introduced us to eachother he would also continually choose to side with his friends and respected their opinion over mine this created a lot of suspicion also a lot of insecurity i knew that his friends were not nice people from the way my ex would talk about them and from the very few times we met they were all just highly misogynistic objectified women nude peddlers etc some of them would insult me or just treat me like i was invisible and somehow after the breakup i ruminate more on my exs friends than my ex i imagine they are watching me when im literally doing anything getting ready talking to people i constantly worry ill bump into my ex or his friends when im outside i think this stems from the fact that i wanted to he respected by them and i guess i even wanted validation from them i have social anxiety but this has definitely made it more severe than usual to the point where i spiral when i see someone who looks like him or his friends even large groups of guys scare me also i tend to do this a lot even before dating my ex i would pretend people i was intimdated by like classmates teachers certain friends who were a bjt meaner to me a love interest were watching me and i would almost perform everything to impress them theres a lot more context needed but essentially i just want to know how i can stop ruminating on them i feel disgusted for wanting validation from people like that but i just cant stop it

1k8zafn,mentalhealth,2025-04-27 08:36:58,how do i stop hating everyone ive always been a judgmental person and i never cared to change yet now its really been interfering with my social life ive blocked so many people im only left with two friends left i nitpick at everyone around me to make myself feel better about myself i dont actually say it out loud unless its my family and im in a shitty mood i know its not okay so because of that i struggle to form relationships with people because i see them as inferior to me when i enter a room i place everyone in some hierarchy to the most attractive to the most liked or one who seems important i get irritated when someone unattractive talks or approaches me it makes me question what makes them think that im on their level and it deeply offends me whenever someone actually has emotional needs wants to vent or anything related to that it just makes me feel repulsed by them anything i felt for them is kinda icky now of course i have to fake empathy or else ill seem like as asshole for some reason a lot of people come to me for their issues its weird then when i finally form a relationship everything feels like competition like theyre trying to be better than me its kinda complicated like if i meet someone i think is good enough and understands me i obviously heavily idealize them then once them show theyre not living up to what i imagined them as i see them as pathetic worthless and discardable ive noticed i only date people who seem worthy or on my level but also thats a contradiction to my own beliefs because i dont want anyone better than me i want to be seen as the smarter prettier kinder loving personpartnerfriend so thats how i tend to display myself i make myself seem as a one of a kind person i hide all my flaws i never publicly start arguments i fit myself to seem perfect so anytime anything involving drama happens im never blamed thats until it all comes off eventually anytime i feel as if anyones challenging my own ego i either get distant and end up blocking them out of showing them their place i know it sounds cringe bare with me or if its someone i know wont leave me i get angry i do want to truly love someone but it gets so hard when everyone is a threat to me i know my standards are extremely unreasonable and i dont even want to get into it i just constantly think everyones out to manipulate me or its some social test it makes me afraid of interacting with people so i stay inside my house because of paranoia the reason people dont tend to leave first is because all these thoughts are internalized and i dont put it out there because i care about my reputation plus if i felt like someone were to try to leave me first id immediately do it before them is this some kind of internal superiority complex im sorry if i spoke i loops and kinda got nowhere im writing this at three in the morning lol i know this is super cringy and corny but please take note im a minor and simply trying to get advice i dont even know how ill feel taking criticism from others though thank you for reading this though

1k8vguu,mentalhealth,2025-04-27 04:16:02,i need help i need help i hate everything about myself regardless of how i think act or change myself i continue to despise myself i hate life and i hate that i hate life because so many people have it ridiculously harder than i have it not only does my hate hurt it feels unjustified as if i am selfish to feel this way recently college applications happened i am one of those kids who gave up everything socializing sleep mental health hell i even became obese cause i put all my time towards studying and refining my college application so i could get into one of the t schools instead i was handed letters that started with sorry every damn time ending up at a school where people who did everything i gave up also got in the worst part the people around me who did the same things i did or even less got into the places i was rejected from the pity they give me feels worse than if they just stabbed me on the spot whats worse when i talk to someone about my feelings they get enraged upset that the school i am going to isnt even a bad school and is in fact some peoples dream schools now im stuck disappointed with what happened and hating myself for being disappointed i gave up everything and got nothing in return and now i doubt if i am worth anything at all my best was worse than some peoples i have a lot of friends i use because im not sure any of them actually like me im not tall built like a fucking bowling ball have acne across my face and dont think im fun to be around all in all if i saw myself i would steer clear this then begs the question do my friends just tolerate me do they just act nice while hoping to be as far away as possible i genuinely dont know but the more i reflect the more i feel that this is the truth that nobody truly enjoys being around me i have a group of friends in which i always felt a little foreign i was never told the juicy drama never knew the inside jokes and was always the butt of the jokes but i stuck with it because these people had everything i wanted popularity strength a nice body attractive and sociable i hate myself for lacking the self respect to walk away for being so dependent on the friendship with them that i cant even leave every single day i feel as though im learning more about how im being thrown aside or about plans that everyone but i know about i am ashamed of being seen i am ashamed of putting people through the pain of having to see me i am ashamed of simply being i feel as if my existence is simply an inconvenience to others i cant stand to see myself in photos in videos and in mirrors i hate the way i look i hate the way i talk i hate everything and the worst part when people crack jokes about me unlike others who can retort i just sit there knowing damn well everything they say about me is true i can keep going but at this point im worried ive inconvenienced the stranger who is reading this with my dumb feelings and useless words so i sit here asking no begging for help as a man who is too cowardly to die and too cowardly to live what do i do

1k8urgh,mentalhealth,2025-04-27 03:34:45,why am i the way i am ive struggled with mental health since maybe my backstory goes like this absentcondescending dad physically emotionally abusive mom vaguely abusive older sister ive been bullied all throughout k except high school and a little bit in my freshman year of college which is almost over i think its because im an unattractive woman and a pushover my mom forced me to see a therapist when i was but i didnt speak to the therapist aside from hello and bye for all four sessions i sat in silence in retrospect i dont think that was normal i regret not saying anything because she probably could have helped me fast forward to and im miserable i have no energy for anything and i feel depressed heres a short list of everything that i think sums it up indifference i could not care less about my life i still complete my assignments and go to work but im so mentally detached from everything i do i dont know why i havent given up yet i am so indecisive i dont even know what my majorcareer should be i just do things because society tells me to not because i want to if it was up to me id lay in bed all day impulsivity i binge eat almost everyday and regularly spend money i dont have on clothes or food one month i spent on mcdonalds the month after i spent grand on clothes and food buying things is the only joy i get messy relationships no friends i have cut off of my friendships first during the pandemic i deleted my social media and then ignored all of my old friends when they tried to approach me at school in high school i had no friends until junior year where i made i cut off of them because they moved away and i felt abandoned i know this was irrational of me the other one is away at college but we dont talk she texted me happy birthday and i responded but thats it i deleted her number from my phone after in college i made friends with a group of girls but they bullied me so i cut them off i literally have no friends not even one its ironic because i am able to make my coworkers and classmates laugh and like me but there is no real depth there when i made friends in the past id go through this weird stage of loving and obsessing over them to hating them and wanting to cut them off i can see why i dont deserve friends but i still feel lonely fear of loneliness i hate feeling lonely but i dont mind being alone i hate looking lonely when i see large groups of people my age i will be on the verge of tears if no one sits next to me on the bus i crave friendship even though i cut off the people who cared about me i selfisolate partly due to anxiety the only human interaction i get is class or work i dont live on campus hateful but i crave connection i am full of hate there is not a day where i wake up and am not angry i spend hours antagonizing people on social media i have borderline crazy thoughts about people that i dont think i can share because i understand how terrible it would sound i regularly wish death on my parents and sister of course i never tell anyone about these thoughts and i still want friends and people to love me despite my abhorrent thoughts i really hate my lifemyself what do i do i was thinking about seeking help but i dont know where to start i want to change but i dont know how

1k8tzfm,mentalhealth,2025-04-27 02:49:54,the world is lonely let me explain im not trying to say the world is so lonely no one cares ok wait i mean i get that its kind of the same thing but its just a little little different anyways as i was saying the world isquite lonely you know people arent there to listen to each other sure therapy is good advice because a licensed professional will always be better than an average person but friendship is nothing but reduced to just having fun together whenever you share any negativity whether with friends or strangers you are quickly shut down why im not sure but its probably because they wouldnt want any negativity in their life either since they probably are victims as well of the very same thing i have mentioned here which is why the listening needs to be reciprocal because venting to friends feels good sure but we have to prepare for when they will vent to us and have full empathy for them which is different than sympathy since one is knowing how the other feels and the other is feeling the same the world is divided and im not gonna even try to say it was better back then because it clearly isnt true from the insights ive gained in the past years but the thing is with the internet we are much more exposed to this which affects irl relationships as well its a little contradictory but the fact is that we are more connected than ever through these wacky waves which are sent by our phones from everywhereand yet we are more lonely than ever because we are overwhelmed but this has always been even back then humans used to outcast whoever was different the thing is sure it might sound like a little rant and all but if you are reading this and a friend is often complaining or such think of them like a water glass which is being filled with water each day now or course it will become full and begin spilling which is exactly where the complaining comes into play so be there listen to your friend be reciprocal with them and also share some of your own complaints and thoughts so you balance each other out after all you are the very same glass drink that they are which means that you are bound to spill as well but lets not enable such things of course it must be reciprocal and not too often or else it turns toxic maybe you could try helping your friend by getting them into some creative hobby where the leaks will come in handy through expression within it tldr people dont listen to each other and are self centered but so are we the ones judging them right now just by reading this post which is why the change has to start within us by listening to others and pouring our own very negative energy into any creative skill we have and turning it into something positive we should listen to each other more and not only care about the good times but push through the bad ones too together

1k8r5lj,mentalhealth,2025-04-27 00:17:16,dont know what to do with my mum hi all hope youre all doing well i need some advice on how to handle a situation going on at the moment for the last id say years my mum has on and off been having glasses of gin and tonic a night measure is roughly doubles so roughly litres per week at first she said this was due to chronic pain as she had osteoarthritis in her knees which she suffered with until when she finally had her second total knee replacement however the drinking has not stoppedslowed down since the one thing i have noticed is she is not drinking monday tuesday wednesday she doesnt work on fridays and will then get a litre bottle of gin after work on a thursday she will drink roughly half the bottle on thursday night and then half on friday night before going out shopping on a saturday and buying a cl small bottle to top the litre bottle back up as if to show shes still got the original bottle left which she will then totally finish the bottle on saturday night before searching for more alcohol in the house i like scotch whisky and she has been known to pretend to be drinking a can of coke to make us think she has finished but in fact she has poured half of it down the sink and refilled it with my whisky which when questioned she goes all quiet and says i must have been in there not very true however as when i have a whisky i normally only have or at most very rarely as it makes me emotional if i have too much or often when she starts drinking she doesnt stop until she is very drunk or asleep she gets extremely argumentative at times and has been known to break glassware and also fall over we have had interventions a couple of times as we can tell this is not regular drinking at all my sister her fiancé and my dad have a similar approach of badgering her to stop drinking or at least cut down to which she will pop back that they are picking on her and she in her own words isnt hurting anyone my approach is far more lenient and i just tell her that i think she is overdoing it and try suggesting trying to cut down to two cl bottles per week rather than a litre and a half plus whatever other alcohol she can find in the house the truth is she is hurting people i can confidently say shes not purposely doing it to upset us however shes hurting herself as she is drinking roughly units per week which is really high above the recommended amount and shes hurting us all watching her doing it as she is clearly drinking purely to escape something in her life which i am not at all sure what it could be any ideas really appreciated because we are totally out of ideas now and we want to do this the most effective and right way we can as we all love her very much

1k8mqej,mentalhealth,2025-04-26 20:44:16,should i consider hospitalization even though im not at risk of suicide i f am a student and from austria the last months of my life have been kinda rough i have had crying attacks multiple times a day for almost a year now my boyfriend and i are permanently fighting and he has abusive tendencies i have gotten away with light bruises until now but it is scary anyways because he can be manipulative and cruel to an extreme extent i am failing three subjects and i suffer from chronic stomach pain and headaches those headaches occur daily and make learning and everything else hard for me i lost all my hobbies and interests and i have no aspirations or goals for the future i cant find any career path that seems even remotely interesting i went to a therapist for half a year but i stopped going a few months ago because i didnt have time for it anymore because of failing school my therapist couldnt help me and blamed everything on stress but i feel even more awful when i am not stressed which is especially problematic during holidays because i cant find a reason to even get up my first psychiatrist wasnt any better and she suggested that i take antidepressants and stimulants and when this didnt help me she simply told me that it must be hormonal and sent me to a different doctor it turned out that my hormones are fine my therapist tested me for depression anxiety and adhd it turned out that i only had adhd which was later declared as a misdiagnosis by my next psychiatrist and she sent me to get an mri at a neurologist the mri indicated nothing wrong and i had some other tests done but every time everything was fine in october i ended up at the hospital due to intense stomache pain and headaches and i couldnt stop throwing up several tests were made and it turned out that i had gallstones but a few days later i had another ultrasound and nothing was to be seen so it was declared as a misdiagnosis again all my organs and my blood have been checked and everything is fine i was sent home two days later and they said that i must have eaten something wrong but i dont think that this is true i still feel awful all the time and im endlessly tired and exhausted from feeling so down all the time my parents think it will be better when i graduate but i actually dont look forward to this because i like school even though im failing and i dont know what ill do after they dont really approve of me going to therapy and taking medication and they arent the most talkative people about the crying that i have mentioned before it happens everywhere and in all situations i get avoided and made fun of at school for this and my boyfriend hates it it happens about to times a day and it takes like half an hour per attack my therapist said im just exhausted and that its a normal reaction but i dont think she believed how often it happens the reasons for it are usually me feeling like a disappointment or a failure but it has happened because of a lot of other stuff too i was told by my boyfriend that i am a burden to him because im constantly ruining his mood my classmates dislike me and i dont have any friends my relationship to my family also isnt great i have contacted a helpline and my school counselor because of my issues but it wasnt helpful for me i dont know what to do anymore and i think that going to a mental health institution and letting myself get hospitalized is the only way out at this point i feel completely hopeless

1k8kf42,mentalhealth,2025-04-26 19:00:12,school makes me want to die i know that sounds dramatic but before you come attacking me in the comments let me explain before covid i used to go to in person school i was a happy kid with lots of friends then covid happened during that period me and my siblings my brother is two years older than me and my sister is four years older than me didnt go to school for a year because of covid after that we switched back and forth between virtual and in person school till we full time did virtual we havent been in the same school for more than two years max that isnt really where the problem starts though because of the gap where we didnt go to school i missed a lot so when i did go back to school even though its virtual i didnt understand anything and they didnt really teach things well because we didnt have as many classes as we would in person they gave us a lot of homework they dont explain the homework well or teach half the time they just put us in breakout rooms to teach ourselves for about twoish years now ive wanted to die i didnt want to kill myself i just wanted to not be alive this year i wanted to die i didnt care if i had to kill myself i stopped doing my homework and skipped alot of classes most of the time i went to class but then they mentioned breakout rooms and i panicked i felt like throwing up and i care way too much about what people think and always think im too dumb or theyll hate me or something so before i know what im doing ive already left the zoom meeting i tried to kill myself times maybe six i wasnt keeping count each of which failed obviously no one found out and i didnt tell anyone i cant sleep at night and i have trouble focusing before you tell me to see if i have a mental illness or something like that i briefly mentioned it to my mom once after she mockingly asked if i had autism and she scoffed saying that even if you did have one you wouldnt and i quote want that on your record so thats out of the question my mom is always yelling to me about homework and calling me retarted etc my dad kind of just sits there and occasionally tries to parent dont get me wrong i love my dad hes a nice guy but because of his job hes basically never home hes sometimes home on late weeks nights and most of the time here on weekends but during that time hes mostly sleeping again dont get me wrong i love him and understand hes working so we have a house and can buy things before you ask my mom technically has a job but shes kind of on and off of it it wouldnt make enough to pay for things we need like groceries housing bills or her shopping trips etc but hes never home so i guess i kind of resent him whenever he tries to parent me i love my mom i think but shes either yellingbeing super pissed and thinking everyone and everything should do what she wants is acting like a child literally or is just watching shows on her ipad and drinking wine and not paying attention to anyone and getting supper mad when someone bothers her i dont think my parents love each other anymore maybe my dad does but my mom is always talking about him behind his back and yelling at him im getting off topic sorry i dont understand the homework and therefore cant do it i literally dont understand the topic or what its even asking causing my mom to yell at and degrate me idk ig i just wanted to vent still wanna kms any advice for the record i have harmed myself before cutting my thighs i never told anyone before and i sometimes still do idk i rarely feel happy anymore and every day feels like im just doing stuff on muscle memory it feels like im drowning if yk what i mean idk what to do i want to cry and scream and punch something

1k8i633,mentalhealth,2025-04-26 17:21:52,ive become a solipsist and plan to keep it secret from my psychiatrist discussing ontology and epistemology with a psychiatrist is asking for trouble solipsism at its core is the philosophical idea that only ones own mind is certain to exist there are different forms but a common thread is the radical skepticism about the existence of anything outside of ones own consciousness including other minds and the external world googles gemini its important to note that solipsism doesnt necessarily reject logic itself a solipsist can still reason logically about their own experiences and the relationships between their thoughts and sensations the issue arises when logic is applied to claims about a reality beyond their own mind googles gemini ive always been very solipsistic i used to believe in a combination of ontological realism and neurological nondualism in which an external physical world exists objectively but since neural activity of the sensory systems of the brain results in this sensory world there exists an illusion of nondualism i have reevaluated this belief which was a result of my personal experiences to be a form of logical deduction but one in which i cannot honestly be certain the only thing i am certain about is that i experience whether those experiences are real or not and whether they reflect an external physical world or not the true nature of consciousness is to be conscious of something i believe that the conscious mind is a priori to experiences and that it is because of ones experiences that one inferred the existence of phenomena beyond ones own mind theres more to cognition than pretending that everything is real while dreaming only to wake up to pretend that everything is real while awake theres no logic to that sort of distorted sense of real
1k8i3td,mentalhealth,2025-04-26 17:19:05,is it so wrong to blame the ppl around you for being what you are now these past few days i have been blaming the people around me specifically my family for what is happening to me now i know this is not such a good thing to do as it just stops me from growing and changing the flaws that i have but somehow i guess i feel tired of always getting mad at myself ever since i was a kid my parents have always been protective of me most of my childhood memories i remember is crying in my room or begging my mom to let me go outside and play with my friends though years ago they finally understood how i felt suffocated and had no freedom if it werent for my school asking them to let me see a psychiatrist which i am now diagnosed with depression anxiety and bpd though i would say they are finally understanding me better than before and letting me meet friends outside im now in college tho lol i felt like because of the environment that they have given me i always felt so weak minded vulnerable and dependent to others i also stopped seeing my psychiatrist and taking meds as i already felt so bad for my parents as we are also struggling financially rn i still want to continue and take meds but somehow it always felt like a burden to my father that i kept seeing a doctor although he doesnt say it but it always felt like seeing a doctor to him is a waste of money and whenever he sees me going happy and smiling for about some weeks hed tell me that maybe i can stop going now but then after that my mental health gets worse and he gets me back to the doctor again it becomes a cycle until i finally just said maybe i can just handle it on my own but i never get to i always feel like hanging by a thread barely achieving something and barely surviving its hard thats why i feel like just blaming them for what i have become now though i want to say more its getting quite long i guess if anyone managed to read up till here that means a lot to me i do hope that i get to finally free myself from all these one day

1k8h1zh,mentalhealth,2025-04-26 16:33:40,ive just come over a discovery so i was going through a rough patch for a bit isolating from my people doing nothing all day overthinking everything and thinking every interaction was a test or just not real probably too many drugs or something but anyway i believe that every feeling is beautiful like being happy and laughing with people feeling down angry disgusted its all like beautiful like if your brain can catch a vibe everything is beautiful and peaceful and blissful at the same time from brain fog to clarity to all the in between how songs make you feel in the moment how the right song makes you feel i remember i was pretty down and out and all i wanted was to go back to my old self laughing all the time being liked etc but im realising that as long as you do what you love every feeling is beautiful ripping an open wavetrack when your down and out and take your sadness anger anxiety happiness like how you feel is your style and however you feel completely changes the way you experience it even people being happy loud laughing maybe a bit down talking or even angry arguing its all beautiful really im really starting to realising your enjoyment in life comes from your perspective not mood like feeling sad feels good angry happy i think it shows you care for whats going on around you and not just some meathead going through life i used to hate being a lot more socially there i guess picking up on things others didnt seeing past things etc and just feeling stuff deeply but i think its a gift when i look at it right like almost like i can experience how other people feel just by thinking about it i love this mane even if i feel different next week ill still hold a certain perspective that i can just get up go to the lineup go to the trials wet a line go play basketball i think everyone needs a hobby they put their soul into no one should be robbed by that from this dirty age we live because of social media and other things like that people constantly putting on a mask to like whats cool this life things a cool mystery man im excited to see what comes next good or bad every experience is different from the last i think a lot of people need to stop living for what others think of them and a lot of world problems would be fixed obviously not things like wars and world hunger but i think if everyone could wake up we would work towards things thought not possible as a society dirty slave corporations big fat money printing companies dirty politicians i think it could all be gone if people see through the materialistic society we live in the cars jet skis money the clothes the houses social media presence im happy ive surrounded myself with people that dont care for that most my life and im definitely seeing less materialism i think as a collective everyones soul is getting sick of the hour days to afford a lifestyle thats all show no go sorry for the yap if anyone even read it i appreciate every one of yall in this subreddit and hope you all get better one day seriously you deserve to experience this even if you hate people or wish death on people you deserve to see the peace in life also never be afraid to reach out theres too much life to live where anything that purposefully shortens it is ever worth it thank yall once again

1g54ik2,Fitness,2024-10-16 17:08:37,workouts without a rest day this is another update about training without rest days i have surpassed consecutive training days along the way i have grown bigger stronger and generally more fit this is because training without rest days requires sustainability above all else to accomplish that my priorities as a lifter have shifted to consistency patience and effort these are what i have previously referred to as the triumvirate of progress those three priorities govern sustainable progress meaning gains what this post is not me saying that rest days are wholly or even generally unwarranted me saying that rest days are bad suboptimal unscientific etc me making a moral or ethical argument about rest days themselves me trying to make you feel bad for taking rest days this post is an anecdote about training without rest days and how daily training has benefitted me stats age gender manlet weight height lol lifts squat bench dead best ever was press natty status i was on trt nearly a decade ago tried it for a year didnt benefit from it like i thought i would based on what i was told at the time nothing during this period i have not and do not claim to be a lifetime natural why i decided to start training daily and heaps of other detailed information that and more can be read in my previous posts five years without a rest day the tom platz experience pain pleasure and high rep squats four years without a rest day no rest days workouts without a rest day training without rest days has benefited me because by prioritizing sustainability over all else i make better training decisions this results in fewer injuries and minor setbacks meaning more gains with less risk lifting is something i enjoy so i do it often and feel better because of it frequency is a significant factor in making progress whether that is gaining size or strength i am now bigger than ive ever been and stronger in nearly every lift my general fitness has improved due to the increased training frequency allowing for more training diversity meaning more opportunities to include conditioning workouts whereas previously nearly all my workouts were strength oriented because i didnt have time to do conditioning consistently an excuse you might benefit similarly if you decide to train without rest days you might not all i can say definitively is that i am happy with my results and because training is itself a luxury and a pleasurable experience i will continue to do it daily counterintuitively busier people seem to do better with daily training this is because a three four or fiveday training week as is typical packs in exercises and a progression that can take an hour or more to complete busy people often do not have that kind of time i have found that my busy clients can manage to minutes consistently and sometimes even less than that so to accomplish their goals they have started training daily with each workout being shorter biasing the program towards consistency which ushers results when coupled with patience effort and of course sensible exercise selection volume and intensity progression while most of my training has been based on my general gainz training framework there are occasions when my progress is not derived from general gainz or even my own original training structure modeled after a pyramid these resources will provide to you a reasonable structure with which you can build your own training programs even brief ones so that you can also begin training daily if it is right for you some may have contraindications there are two things that have recently benefitted my training the first was when i ran a program called maelstrom which resulted in a lifetime personal record pound beltless deadlift here is a review another user wrote of their experience running that program this was a very unusual approach to training the deadlift because it is high frequency high volume and low intensity the second occasion was when i had only a brief period to get a training session in this happens somewhat regularly now because i own my own business to train effectively in a short period of time i would do workouts that i began to call monotony these helped me maintain the daily training streak because even if i had only minutes in my schedule i could still hammer a lift and benefit from the workout perhaps you would likewise benefit you can read maelstrom monotony and watch me perform those workouts on my blog and instagram on my blog you will have access to an updated program compendium so that way you can perhaps run one of my old programs like gzclp jacked tan or try drowning in deadlifts by running maelstrom i wish you the best with your training if you have any questions drop them in the comments and ill do my best to answer them

1judkby,mentalhealth,2025-04-08 13:28:28,i m have been seeing prostitutes since the age of and i am now realising that this may be why i struggle to connect sexually with partners and have depression what to do hi heavy title i know for some background info i am from a country that has legal prostitution similar to the netherlands there are no age checks its just a street that you can walk into the details are not important but i found myself with enough money gifted from grandparents unbeknownst to parents and i had just felt my sexual awakening i lost my virginity there it set me off on years of visiting prostitutes with no thought about its implications paying for sex just became my normal and i never knew anything else i rejected conventional relationships because i could never feel sexual about my partners in my mind this was a separate activity to be done almost like a ritual with no emotions involved but recently after the breakdown of my second relationship it has finally dawned on me how fucked up all of this is the exploitation of women that i am contributing to the dangerous places and people i interacted with across different countries i have travelled to to partake not for prostitutes but i always seem to find a way wherever i go for work or leisure the fact that i had sex at with a prostitute i have not partaken for a while now but my problem is my sex drive seems irreversibly damaged nothing gets me aroused i am unable to express myself sexually at all i feel weird talking about sex i feel gross having sex with anyone i am emotionally invested in i dont understand how to explore sex because its been so mechanic and unemotional for me and i dont know any better i really dont know what to do this is starting to affect beyond sex i feel damaged guilty and disgusting i feel empty and depressed its like a black cloud following me everywhere in my otherwise seemingly perfect life what can i do who do i speak to are there therapists that specialise in this just to note i have never been unprotected or continued whilst with a partner i get tested frequently so this is a mental not physical issue for me

1js16z6,mentalhealth,2025-04-05 11:18:24,why is bpd excusatory but narcissism is accusatory i would have posted this in raskreddit but i couldnt write more than the title basically why i know a few people with bpd and one of them ex friend used it as an excuse for shitty behavior like cancelling plans she insisted in make with me with no regard of my time i had a job and little free time and no im sorry for being such an asshole to be fair most people i know with bpd are working towards selfimprovement and being functional beings of society but in the case of that girl she used it as an excuse and also her mother who stopped talking to me because she understand what her daughter has and she loves her the way she is basically spoiling her but on the other hand narcissism is an accusatory term rraisedbynarcissists or rnarcissisticabuse for example but both narcissism and bpd are clinical terms they are cluster b diagnosis but no one would say you have to empathise with me and excuse me for my behavior i have narcissistic personality disorder but many people with bpd say this as if people with bpd cant control their actions but narcissistics are machiavelic or something if i tell you the issue with that former friend without mentioning her disorder many will tell me she is a narcissist screw her but if i mention she has bpd so so so many people from tiktok and selfdiagnosed with some disorder will say you gotta understand her she has a disorder that messes up her personality you have to support her she doesnt want to be like this why narcissism is still a disorder not just being evil bpd still has awful consequences on the mental and emotional health of your close people just because you have a diagnosed mental disorder doesnt mean you can get away with being insensitive and emotionally irresponsible others have their feelings their problems and even their mental disorders hello depression and anxiety tldr narcissism is a disorder that requires treatment not just being evil and bpd is not an excuse for shitty behavior and getting away with it

1k7lp74,mentalhealth,2025-04-25 14:02:02,tired of being called neurodivergent its okay to say abnormal disclaimer this is no diss to people who call themselves neurodivergent im glad for you if that term resonates with you this is from the perspective of someone who doesnt resonate with the term theres five siblings in my family and my oldest sister constantly describes us all as neurodivergent ive just never identified with this term nor neurotypical i think the two terms are overused not unlike how people tend to overuse the term narcissistnarcissism now i think it also verges on selfcontradictory and can be regressive with the way i normally see it being used my understanding is that it originated to move away from using the terms normal and abnormal but in my opinion those arent bad words they just mean what typically doesdoesnt occur they are neutral terms that we need to reclaim the connotation of but it feels like neurodivergent has been overused to a point where its become the catchall for things that are pretty standard human quirks its like its literally become the new normal everyone is different everyones brain is unique and if were all neurodivergent as the term is typically used then none of us are divergent so whats the point of treating any mental illness i have mild dyslexiadyscalculia and severe anxiety that manifests in obsessivecompulsive tendencies and these actively prevent me from utilizing the strengths that my unique human brain naturally has which is contrary to what neurodivergent means my dyslexia and anxiety dont offer me unique strengths they hinder me from using the unique strengths i actually have does that mean im somehow bad for having these issues no it means i have a disorder and that is abnormal and its okay to be abnormalhave abnormalities i would much rather be called abnormal and receive the help i need for being such than have my struggles brushed off as simply being neurodivergent and therefore somehow fine im not fine and i dont want my issues sugarcoated i have abnormalities and that is not a moral failing i need help that other people dont and that is okay again i dont mind if other people want to call themselves neurodivergent but i wish it wasnt assumed that everyone with a mental illness or disorder wants to be referred to with this term i understand im probably in the minority there though so i dont expect it to change just venting thank you in advance for being kind in your responses

1k55kum,mentalhealth,2025-04-22 12:54:33,im upset with myself for being f and letting my teeth get so bad that ill need dentures this is a whole rant and story behind my teeth see previous post for pics but viewer discretion is advised ive had issues with dental stuff as a kid but not to this extent it would be something like multiple cavities filled for too much sugar and improper brushing even had a tooth break when i was and panicked but again my teeth were just yellow but looked beautiful but now it didnt start getting bad until i was since i have been on a pure liquid diet from boost plus drinks alone due to swallowing issues i drink of them a day to get the nutrients i need to live i guess all the drinks caused acid in the mouth and its been horrible to my teeth the past few years im ashamed of myself since i didnt think it was that until about a year or ago and didnt take better care of my mouth even tho ive always had issues with brushing properly to begin with i would have at least try washing my mouth with water every boost drink to help with the acid level im especially ashamed when my own family thinks my swallowing issues are in my head when i had a pill get stuck in my throat and severely burn my throat i also have acid reflux since i was about too which also probably caused this it just feels like life threw a curve ball at me i dont even drink soda all the time like i did as a kid and even still my teeth looked good back then for a whole year or two it felt like that pill was still in my throat and it hurts to swallow foods the first few days was so bad after i swallowed the pill wrong that i stopped eating entirely i received nothing but backlash from family about it i always get triggered when they ask me if im eating anything because i know its not possible for me and i hide my teeth from them too cause i know theyd just point out its cause of my drinks drinking the boost drinks was my last resort since i wasnt eating and lost lbs from it but im still alive to this day even years later when i tried eating more solid foods i still feel like something is wrong with my throat its not fair i know its destroying my teeth to be drinking boost and im sure my digestive system too but my anxiety and physical pain in my throat prevents me from eating now even if i wanted to eat my teeth would just hurt badly and break if i tried no one understands what its like to be in my shoes to not eat food like everyone else then be treated like an alien when i enjoy stuff like ranch sauce or cheese sauce or liquified foods guacamole with no tomato if im feeling brave enough

1k6lisy,mentalhealth,2025-04-24 06:31:53,i was sexually coerced as a young boy and it led me down a dark road but i always told myself i gotta keep living to tell my story and help the others hi there this is my first post ill do my best thanks for taking the time to share this safe space with me i was groomed by a male at the church i was at and ended up with many years of sexual abuse from him im now male married to my wife and have children my eldest daughter is to another woman but we see her biweekly i think i was when it started and managed to finally cut ties when i was i never told anyone until i was years old this meant i was in a constant state of fightorflight and had a very disturbed and despondent world view throughout all of my formative years im lucky that i come from a loving family background chaos and the rollercoaster of life of course but the foundation was solid i did go off the rails and become the black sheep for a while at i went through a period of gender dysphoria the only logical correlation i could make at the time was that if the younger me had accepted and put up with all of those years of being used as a sex toy i must be a female in the wrong body i came out and spent months in transition before the bullying and ostracization sent me into a long and dark period of depression the dark periods occured across many facets of my life and still occur to this day i was also diagnosed with various mh labels in my early s anxiety depression bpd i went through a period of psychosis and when i finally started reaching out for help years ago i was diagnosed with cptsd these labels were all true in regards to the symptoms but i rejected them i didnt want to be defined by a diagnosis label so i didnt take any of the medications they prescribed i now know that i was subconsciously practicing self sabotage because i wasnt accepting the diagnosis knowing that i wasnt talking about the abuse i had been through and experienced my story is super long and complicated i went through drugs selling my body hanging with the wrong people i also went to na meetings and had a really good mask when faced with the light of day i fooled everyone into thinking i was a fun loving kind guy i am true but the amount of trauma and pain i carry have seen and continue to work through is insane i have an innate need to help people i like to talk about loving kindness with strangers why because what we put out we get back and all i want to see in the universe is loving kindness so that is my fundamental compass throughout all of this i managed to clean up off the drugs and sex scene and got a career in construction at and just kept my head down for years this ingrained a lot of disassociative coping mechanisms to keep my mask on straight while my insides boil and sizzle through every moment of the day the anxiety is insane and so are the flashbacks its very visceral and i wont bear anyone here the burden of hearing the details my need to help people continued to thrive and i finally met a woman who wanted to carry my child and settle down the relationship didnt work out but i was there throughout the pregnancy in best support i could be and maintain shared parenting arrangements to this day family is very important to me i met my wife in papua new guinea and shes back in nz with me and we have beautiful children together i had a severe tbi months ago and as i go through rehab this foundation of pain and trauma are very raw and so i will continue to tell my story

1k7uyd9,mentalhealth,2025-04-25 20:26:11,i wish bad things would happen to me im kind of at a point where i would say im doing well except for this constant want for bad things to happen i wouldnt say im suicidal i have no desire to make any act towards ending my life but i always wish something would happen that would kill me or at least put me at risk i had surgery the other day and found myself wishing that something would happen that id bleed out or theyd find something incurable i feel so guilty because i know those who actually have issues like that would give anything to not have it i think part of it is definitely a form of suicidal ideation but i think a larger part is that i want some justification to feel this way i dont know im still not with it mentally as im still recovering but im just exhausted and hoping im not the only one who feels like this

1k76nen,mentalhealth,2025-04-24 23:31:22,my parents are kicking my sister out and even if its justified im sad before i start it is justified theyre not even kicking her out theyre going to give her until october to find a new job and a place she doesnt know it yet shes been mentally abusing them and our family for years and years shes sick not the depressed sick she was diagnosed with bipolarity at some point but then said doctors were wrong and she wasnt so she stopped her meds but to me its probably something more like personality disorder we wont know because she refuses to see anyone one day she threw away worth of food even though we struggle financially because she didnt want us to eat things she wasnt allowing herself to eat she was on a diet to loose weight and because of that we couldnt eat anything that wasnt vegetables we had to put locks on the fridge locks our father had a cancer scare last year because he lost so much weight doctors were in alerts turns out its depression that wore him down hes nearing and sometimes im so scared for their health my mom keeps crying because she cant deal with my sisters outbursts anymore shes mostly the target everytime there is something wrong its because of our mom she says a bad mom a toxic mom selfish manipulator and it keeps going yelling yelling yelling shes so great with words that she will hurt anyone deeply with them our parents were never perfect but who can say they have perfect parents our dad is ex military so he was not extra feelings with us as a kid but hes always been a great dad our mom had so much problems with her family she didnt grow up to be a huggey mother either neither was her mom so yes were daughters but maybe she needed more attention than they could provide but it doesnt justify the hell shes put them through for years i could list the tons of things they did for her but she forgets them when you mentions it she doesnt remember them only the bad she extrapolate reality too lies distort assume things are happening when theyre not she gets paranoid once told me she wanted to hurt people the way they hurt her i will always remember how dark her eyes were that day thats the first time i felt uneasy im sad because i dont know if shell live long she said she attempted scide once or twice before and she came back home a decade ago because she was living alone in her apartment and was this close to hanging herself she said i know she cant live alone thats why shes here with us at i know and our uncle was like her before he died at ish despite it all i dont want her to die not like that not so young i also know well never see her again the only reason we can reach her right now is because she lives with us she cut contact with everyone she barely use her phone shell be so mad at them for this decision that shell pack her things and go and never look back i know her so i guess im sad ill be loosing my big sister regardless of everything shes done to me and others i hate her for it all i really do the things shes said and done but i feel sad too i hate her for putting us all her included in this situation

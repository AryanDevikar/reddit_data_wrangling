To help him out, I analyzed his films and their movie posters to come up with a perfectly bad Sandler film entitled 'Jacked Up'","Earlier in the year, Adam Sandler was a guest on Howard Stern’s show to discuss his starring role in the excellent *Uncut Gems*. During the interview, Sandler made a joke about what would happen if he didn’t win the Best Actor Academy Award. [He told Howard](https://www.businessinsider.com/adam-sandler-threatened-to-make-bad-movie-if-he-doesnt-win-oscar-uncut-gems-2019-12):

“If I don’t get it, I’m going to f–king come back and do one again that is so bad on purpose just to make you all pay. That’s how I get them.”

In a bad news, bad news situation, Sandler wasn’t nominated, and he’s promised to make a terrible film (I’ll still watch it a few times regardless). In an effort to assist the Sandman with his terrible film, I dug through all of his films and analyzed their posters to come up with the objectively worst Sandler picture that could be made. Here it is:

* *Jacked Up*
* Directed by Dennis Dugan
* Written By - Tim Herlihy
* PG-13
* Running Time: 135 minutes
* Released on Netflix
* Predicted Tomatometer score - 6%
* Predicted IMDb score - 3.75

Adam Sandler plays a personal trainer/shoe salesman named Jack Goodheart who is married to Janet Goodheart (Also, Sandler, using a very off-putting voice). They travel to an exclusive resort in Costa Rica to attend his 30th high school anniversary during the fourth of July weekend. During the event, Rob Schneider (playing a terrorist) and his team of henchmen, hijack the event and take everyone hostage, including State Senator Chuck Finley (Terry Crews) and presidential candidate Casey Fitzpatrick (Maya Rudolph). During the melee, Jack and Janet escape, and the two use their past military experience and buff physiques to save the day. This PG-13 action-comedy is entitled “*Jacked Up*” and ends with a jet ski chase at the hotel’s lazy river pool that circles the hotel. The film is directed by Dennis Dugan, and co-stars Kevin James, Chris Rock, David Spade, Salma Hayek, Terry Crews, Steve Buscemi, Taylor Lautner, Luke Wilson, Peter Dinklage, Maya Rudolph, and Al Pacino.

This is how I came up with the storyline. I pulled together his best and worst films to find patterns that appear. Here are Sandler's lowest rated films on Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb. I drew a lot of inspiration from them. Also, I tried to make this as objective as possible.

* *The Ridiculous 6  (0% TM)* \- Action Comedy  - Action hero
* *Jack and Jill (3% - 3.3 IMDb)* \- Two Sandler's - Jet Ski scene - Married - Holiday
* *Grown Ups 2* (7%) - Reunited with old friends - Married
* *Bulletproof* (8%) - Action comedy
* *The Cobbler* (9%) - Shoe repairman
* *The Do-Over (10%)*  \- Action Comedy - Reunited with old friend - Married
* *Grown Ups (10%)* \- Reunited with old friends - Holiday - Married
* *Adam Sandler’s Eight Crazy Nights (12%)*\- Takes place during a holiday
* *Blended* (14%) - He’s a dad who travels to Africa
* *Going Overboard* (1.8 IMDb) - Lots of terrible boat action
* *The Week Of* (5.1 IMDb) families get together for a wedding
* *Sandy Wexler (5.1 IMDb)* \- Sandler pulls a unique voice (which isn’t statistically a good thing

**Here’s all I research I compiled to create** ***Jacked Up***

* A trademark of Sandler’s latest movies is that he likes to travel to beautiful locations to film (which is brilliant, and why not?). *The Do-Over, Just Go With It, Blended*, *Grown Ups 1 & 2* and *Murder Mystery* are examples of his penchant for travel. The problem is, the films have a lower Tomatometer average (21.2%) than the films where he didn’t travel to nice locations (37.4%). This is why he travels in *Jacked Up*.
* Sandler has several directors that he enjoys working with. Those Directors are Steven Brill, Dennis Dugan and Frank Coraci. Steven Brill (20%) has a lower Tomatometer average than Dennis Dugan (24%) and Frank Coraci (30%). However, Dugan is responsible for *Jack & Jill*, so I’m giving him the director’s chair. He did direct *Happy Gilmore*, so this could backfire on me. Frank Coraci directed *The Ridiculous 6*, but, [I love the baseball scene ](https://youtu.be/sI6LvdaozEk)and he also directed *The Waterboy* and *The Wedding Singer.*
* Aside from *You Don’t Mess With the Zohan* ([which is brilliant, and has a fun jet ski action scene](https://youtu.be/5OfAMHeIr7k)), His action comedies are lackluster. *Bulletproof* (8%) and *The Do-Over (9%)* didn’t win him many points. That’s why *Jacked Up* features an action-centered plot.
* His films featuring him as a married man have a 29% Tomatometer average. Movies featuring him as a single man have a 38% Average. Thus, the marriage to himself (think *Jack & Jill*) is included. It’s a double whammy
* I picked Tim Herlihy to write because he wrote *The Ridiculous Six, Grown Ups 2* and *Pixels (8% average)*. I do love his *Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison, The Wedding Singer* and *The Waterboy* scripts though
* His PG-13 (29%) rated films have a lower Tomatometer average than his R (51%) and PG-rated (45%) films. For Netflix, M rating = R and TV-14 = PG-13
* I included a pool because in [*Airheads* he is a pool cleaner who thinks about swimming pools](https://youtu.be/YryTJKsn2i0). Also, *Grown Ups, The Do-Over, Jack and Jill* feature swimming pools. They have low scores.
* Movies that feature Sandler doing a voice have a lower Tomatometer score (24.8%) than his regular voiced roles (36%).
* None of his Fresh films feature a jet ski -[ *50 first Dates*](https://youtu.be/S__SZwFn0Rw) *(45%),* [*Jack & Jill*](https://youtu.be/leAGt-vpIf0) *(3%)* and *You Don’t Mess with the Zohan (37%)* are all Rotten
* In *The Ridiculous Six, Grown Ups, The Do-Over*, and *Bulletproof* he plays a totally capable man who isn’t an underdog like he is in *Billy Madison* and *Happy Gilmore*. So, he can’t be a doofus during the action scenes.
* Randomly enough, Rob Schneider shouldn’t adopt some kind of stereotyped character because his makeup-less roles have a lower Tomatometer average (27.6%) than his stereotyped roles (32%).
* His lowest rated movies on IMDb are *Going Overboard* (1.5), *Jack & Jill* (3.3), *The Ridiculous 6* (4.8), *Sandy Wexler* (5.1) and *The Week Of* (5.1) - These movies feature water exploits, gun fights, weird voices, two Sandlers, and large gatherings. These things are all in *Jacked Up*.
* \*Bulletproof (\*$25 million), *Little Nicky* ($39 million) and *Blended* ($46 million) are a few of his lowest grossing comedies. In these films, he uses a wild voice, goes on vacations and engages in action shenanigans. I left out movies like *Spanglish* and *Reign Over Me* because they aren’t traditional Sandler comedies. Also, *Billy Madison* and *Happy Gilmore* weren’t huge earners. However, they established him as a force of nature.
* His first or last name couldn’t begin with an “R” -  Howard Ratner (*Uncut Gems*), Henry Roth (*50 First Dates*), Robbie Hart (*The Wedding Singer*).

**WHAT DOES THE POSTER NEED TO LOOK LIKE?**

* He cannot be centered on the poster. His best films *Punch Drunk Love, Happy Gilmore, Funny People* and *Uncut Gems* feature him centered on the poster. *The Wedding Singer, Reign Over Me* and *The Meyerowitz Stories* don’t have him centered. However, the movie posters that have centered have a 48% Tomatometer Average. The Posters that have him on the left have a 30% Tomatometer average. I’m going with that.

https://preview.redd.it/actfhq081a551.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9c8031c0894460b3d33ee218f96d31e80abcd3df

He' rarely centered in his ""worst"" films

https://preview.redd.it/7592qqi41a551.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ff647a066806a5dfbf516fd83ebff761d79621dc

* There needs to be multiple people on the poster. When Sandler is alone on a poster, his movies have a 42% Tomatometer average. The movie posters with 4+ people have a 20% Tomatometer average. More is good.
* In this poster he needs to be holding something random. In *The Cobbler* poster he is holding a coffee cup (this is important) and the movie has an 8% Tomatometer score. In *The Wedding Singer* (microphone) and *Happy Gilmore* (golf club) and *The Waterboy* (bucket, helmet) he is holding items related to his character. He needs to be holding something weird (like a can of sponsored coca-cola). Also, the posters that feature him holding an item (31%) have a lower Tomatometer score than the posters featuring him not holding anything (42%).

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/l6mzirud1a551.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d8ccf8ee14641d421c38e2c0775f00299e517d83

* It’s best if his entire body is on the poster. The movie posters featuring a full-bodied Adam Sandler have a lower Tomatometer average (31%) than his partial body posters (43%).
* Ideally, the title would be in the center, because *Jack & Jill* and *The Ridiculous Six* have somewhat centered titles.

**Poster**

* Title centered
* Sandler(s) on left side - Full body
* At least six other characters on the poster

There you have it! I can't wait to watch *Jacked Up*.

would make a terrible film if he didnt win a best actor academy award for uncut gems to help him out i analyzed his films and their movie posters to come up with a perfectly bad sandler film entitled jacked up earlier in the year adam sandler was a guest on howard sterns show to discuss his starring role in the excellent uncut gems during the interview sandler made a joke about what would happen if he didnt win the best actor academy award he told howard if i dont get it im going to fking come back and do one again that is so bad on purpose just to make you all pay thats how i get them in a bad news bad news situation sandler wasnt nominated and hes promised to make a terrible film ill still watch it a few times regardless in an effort to assist the sandman with his terrible film i dug through all of his films and analyzed their posters to come up with the objectively worst sandler picture that could be made here it is jacked up directed by dennis dugan written by tim herlihy pg running time minutes released on netflix predicted tomatometer score predicted imdb score adam sandler plays a personal trainershoe salesman named jack goodheart who is married to janet goodheart also sandler using a very offputting voice they travel to an exclusive resort in costa rica to attend his th high school anniversary during the fourth of july weekend during the event rob schneider playing a terrorist and his team of henchmen hijack the event and take everyone hostage including state senator chuck finley terry crews and presidential candidate casey fitzpatrick maya rudolph during the melee jack and janet escape and the two use their past military experience and buff physiques to save the day this pg actioncomedy is entitled jacked up and ends with a jet ski chase at the hotels lazy river pool that circles the hotel the film is directed by dennis dugan and costars kevin james chris rock david spade salma hayek terry crews steve buscemi taylor lautner luke wilson peter dinklage maya rudolph and al pacino heres the first fan made poster ill add as more people share thank you ukelkith here is another fan made poster thank you utremetal another very fun poster this is how i came up with the storyline i pulled together his best and worst films to find patterns that appear here are sandlers lowest rated films on rotten tomatoes and imdb i drew a lot of inspiration from them also i tried to make this as objective as possible the ridiculous tm action comedy action hero jack and jill imdb two sandlers jet ski scene married holiday grown ups reunited with old friends married bulletproof action comedy the cobbler shoe repairman the doover action comedy reunited with old friend married grown ups reunited with old friends holiday married adam sandlers eight crazy nights takes place during a holiday blended hes a dad who travels to africa going overboard imdb lots of terrible boat action the week of imdb families get together for a wedding sandy wexler imdb sandler pulls a unique voice which isnt statistically a good thing heres all i research i compiled to create jacked up a trademark of sandlers latest movies is that he likes to travel to beautiful locations to film which is brilliant and why not the doover just go with it blended grown ups and murder mystery are examples of his penchant for travel the problem is the films have a lower tomatometer average than the films where he didnt travel to nice locations this is why he travels in jacked up sandler has several directors that he enjoys working with those directors are steven brill dennis dugan and frank coraci steven brill has a lower tomatometer average than dennis dugan and frank coraci however dugan is responsible for jack jill so im giving him the directors chair he did direct happy gilmore so this could backfire on me frank coraci directed the ridiculous but i love the baseball scene he also directed the waterboy and the wedding singer aside from you dont mess with the zohan which is brilliant and has a fun jet ski action scene his action comedies are lackluster bulletproof and the doover didnt win him many points thats why jacked up features an actioncentered plot his films featuring him as a married man have a tomatometer average movies featuring him as a single man have a average thus the marriage to himself think jack jill is included its a double whammy i picked tim herlihy to write because he wrote the ridiculous six grown ups and pixels average i do love his happy gilmore billy madison the wedding singer and the waterboy scripts

8x9c6b,[self] Dear Netflix - stop auto-playing every time I want to look at a title.,"I mainly watch Netflix on my Playstation, but often on my computer too. I’m very close to canceling my service based solely on this one unbearable design flaw.
If I want to read a description of whatever I’m thinking about watching, I should be able to do it without having my eyes and ears assaulted. In fact, I frequently skip over titles (including, of course, a lot of Netflix original content) simply because I don’t want it to come blaring through my screen and speakers before I’m done perusing.
I don’t even see why this is an option. Nobody wants this.
Stop.

Edit: wow, I did not expect my wine-fueled rant to gain anywhere near this much traction. I finally understand “RIP my inbox”. I’m thrilled to see so many people here share my sentiment.

Edit 1: Spelt Rey wrong sorry! Autocorrect and I didn't check.

Edit 2: Thank you so very much for the support that this post has received, it really has been quite overwhelming. This post is very much a quick outpouring of thoughts of mine rather then a well thought through argument focusing on the main issues with EA's Star Wars Battlefront 2. I only eluded to the main issues, rather than outright stating the unacceptable issues with loot boxes, progression grind, the pay to win aspects and the short campaign etc. However people who are on this sub reddit are very much aware of the main issues.

All I hope that this post has managed to bring attention to the main issues and bring about some positive change.

8swmb2,"Youtuber ""Potates"" completely plagiarized a post I made on r/Fallout about Fallout 76, and passed it off as his own work. The video is now at 800k views.","EDIT 5: Just wanted to thank everybody for their interest in this topic and in me as a content creator. Now that things are cooling off, I will make an update thread a few days from now to let everybody know how things have turned out. 

There are also hundreds of people encouraging me to make a YouTube channel and I just wanted to acknowledge that. I really appreciate your interest and may set something up, but I don't have anything at this moment to share.

Thanks everybody for their kind words and support. :)

I'm not sure why this thread was locked, I didn't get a message from the mods about it. I assume just because the thread has run its course, and I'm okay with that.

**EDIT 2:**

I had no idea that this thread would blow up in the way that it has -- I only posted here to begin with because a buddy of mine posts here and he said it would be good to share, and maybe get some exposure for the original post. I am pretty overwhelmed with the amount of people who are taking an interest in this and I want to make it abundantly clear that I do not and will not ever support anybody who is dishing out threats and personal attacks against Potates. Be better than that. Thanks.

Potates has DM'd be acknowledging the situation and owning up to it, and does not deserve to be harassed and threatened over this. He has been cool about the whole situation and I am willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, and be cool back. Neither he nor I knew just how crazy this situation was going to get. Again, I am asking you from the bottom of my heart, do not lash out at Potates. Do not harass him, do not harass his family. These actions are 100% wrong and I condemn them wholeheartedly. Calling him out for his behavior is one thing, but when you cross the line into his real life, you have gone too far and need to reexamine your moral compass.

**EDIT 4:**

I am aware that Potates has removed all his videos except for his apology. I am not responsible for this, and I have not filed any kind of DMCA claim against him as we are settling things privately. I have and will continue to encourage him to not delete his YouTube channel, as I believe he can and will bounce back from this controversy. Plagiarism is serious, and there is a lesson here to be learned -- if he respects the content of *all* creators moving forward, then his channel can become a positive part of YouTube again.

It is easy to be angry at this situation, believe me. But I am always willing to give somebody another chance if they are prepared to make a genuine change, and for now, I am willing to give that chance and let things play out.

-------------------

Link to the Potates video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t26s5aMSBWY

Link to my post, which he reads (mostly) verbatim off in his video without any credit to me, or even that it is a post from reddit, whatsoever: https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/8qsx8s/complete_notes_from_the_noclip_documentary/

\^That's a massive Fallout 76 info dump based on the Noclip documentary that had a strong community reaction, and got passed around a lot. It took me a while to write up as I watched the documentary, and I spent a non-trivial amount of time making as it clear and concise as possible, using direct quotes whenever possible. Shout out to when he misread one of my points that said camps are saved as blueprints, and accidentally said ""served as blueprints"" which is a nonsensical statement.

I'm passionate about video games, and love to write about them, even though I'm not a professional. So to see something you've written being plagiarized after putting in time and effort to share that written content with people just hurts a little bit. When you're looking for more opportunities to write in a way that will attract attention, seeing somebody else take that attention can really suck.

He starts his video off at the ""Gameplay"" section of my post, and at the beginning switches up his verbiage a little bit so it's not too obvious. As the video goes on, that stops quickly, and he starts reading every single bullet point almost verbatim. I'm not *too* upset because I'm glad more people got to see the information, but I am a little irritated that he passes it off as his own work. He reads the post like it was his script! Even the way he does the voice over makes it sound as if he is saying these things off the cuff, when in reality he is reading off the words I wrote from a page.  I only found this video at all because I clicked it and wanted to hear new Fallout 76 information -- a minute or two in, I realized that I had heard those words before... because I wrote them!

Here's the thing. If he had shot me a message saying ""hey man, I'd like to quote this post in a video"", I'd have said go for it 100%. If at the beginning of the video he had said something like ""hey guys I found this post on reddit I'd like to read you"", I'd be fine with that. But the fact that he passes this off as if he wrote it all, or as if he took the time to compile this information is definitely frustrating to me. I feel like I put in the work for this, and then this guy turned around and monetized it without even having the decency to acknowledge that it wasn't his. 




EDIT: I see a lot of you commenting on the video saying that he has stolen my content. Unfortunately, it appears as if he is deleting all of those comments as they come in.

---------------


**EDIT 3:***

~~I tried to comment on Potates' apology video, but the comments aren't going through. Here is what I wrote, if I am able to post it directly on the video I will do so in the morning.~~ **EDIT 5:** It appears as if the apology video has been deleted.

> Hey, I'm _Robbie. First off, I would like to lead with the fact that I completely condemn anybody who is issuing any kind of threats to @Potates and his family. Nobody deserves to be threatened and harassed over a situation like this. 

> Secondly, I would encourage @Potates not to delete his YouTube channel. I do not agree that there is no coming back from this. Mistakes were made, feathers were ruffled, and lessons were learned. I have seen smaller YouTube channels come back from worse. I have given Potates full permission to re-post the offending video under the agreement that I am properly credited, and that we can work out our differences in private. I truly believe in the value of giving somebody another chance, and even in spite of everything, I am willing to give Potates another chance.

> This whole situation got out of hand to a degree that nobody could have predicted.  Me and Potates are making things right between us in private as I type this and I am confident that we will come to an understanding.

this whole situation got out of hand to a degree that nobody could have predicted me and potates are making things right between us in private as i type this and i am confident that we will come to an

7ekwu9,The FCC is about to kill net neutrality. We’re protesting nationwide on Dec 7th to stop them.,"**tldr: The FCC is about to kill net neutrality. We’re protesting nationwide on Dec 7th to stop them.
Head over to http://www.verizonprotests.com/ for more info.**

**WHAT’S HAPPENING?**
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) just [announced](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20171120/11253438653/fcc-plan-to-use-thanksgiving-to-hide-attack-net-neutrality-vastly-underestimates-looming-backlash.shtml) its plan to slash net neutrality rules, allowing ISPs like Verizon to block apps, slow websites, and charge fees to control what you see & do online. They vote December 14th. People from across the political spectrum are outraged, so we’re planning to protest at Verizon retail stores across the country on December 7, one week before the vote and at the peak of the busy Holiday shopping season. We'll demand that our members of Congress take action to stop Verizon's puppet FCC from killing net neutrality.

**WHAT’S NET NEUTRALITY?**
Net neutrality is the [basic principle](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/05/the-case-for-rebooting-the-network-neutrality-debate/361809/) that has made the Internet into what it is today. It prevents big Internet Service Providers (like Verizon) from charging extra fees, engaging in censorship, or controlling what we see and do on the web by throttling websites, apps, and online services.

**WHY VERIZON STORES?**
The new chairman of the FCC, Ajit Pai, is a former top lawyer for Verizon, and the company has been spending millions on [lobbying](https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/12/15959932/comcast-verizon-att-net-neutrality-day-of-action) and lawsuits to kill net neutrality so they can gauge us all for more money. By protesting at Verizon stores, we’re shining light on the corruption and demanding that our local do something about it. Only Congress has the power to stop Verizon's puppet FCC, so at the protests we'll be calling and tweeting at legislators, and in cities where it's possible we'll march from Verizon stores to lawmakers offices.

**WHAT ARE OUR DEMANDS?**
Ajit Pai is clearly still working for Verizon, not the public. But he still has to answer to Congress. So we’re calling on our lawmakers to do their job overseeing the FCC and speak out against Ajit Pai’s plan to gut Title II net neutrality protections and give Verizon and other giant ISPs everything on their holiday wishlist. 

**HOW CAN I JOIN?**

**[But there’s still hope. The most effective way to can stop this is by driving as many calls as possible to our Senators and Representatives, now through Nov. 22nd. ](https://www.battleforthenet.com)**

We're getting word that there are lawmakers who are sympathetic to our cause and considering taking action to slow the FCC down, but they won’t act unless they get more phone calls from constituents. Also, if your think your Rep's opposed to net neutrality, its all the more reason to call them. Those Reps need to hear your voice more than anyone.

**Please, head over to https://www.battleforthenet.com , and give your Senators and Reps a call telling them to stop the FCC from slashing Title II net neutrality protections.** The time to act is now.

To reach the call in line directly by phone, **call 202-930-8550**.

When you get through to your Rep's office, introduce yourself, be polite, and say: 
> I support ""Title Two"" net neutrality rules and I urge you to oppose the FCC's plan to repeal them. Specifically, I'd like you to contact the FCC Chairman and demand he abandon his current plan.

PIGEON FORGE, Tenn. (WZTV) — Dollywood on Tuesday announced they'll start paying a hundred percent of tuition for employees who wish to further their education. This includes the cost of fees and textbooks.

The education benefit package is available to all team members on the first day of their employment. The company says it's a way for employees at all levels to pursue their personal and professional dreams.

Piloted by Dolly Parton's operating partner Herschend Enterprises, the program from GROW U. will mark a significant investment for workers. President of Dollywood Company Eugene Naughton says it's an opportunity for employees to grow.

""One of The Dollywood Foundation’s key tenets is to ‘learn more.’ This program is created with that very tenet in mind. We want our hosts to develop themselves through advanced learning to fulfill the foundation’s other tenets: care more, dream more, and be more.""
The program will officially launch Feb. 24 for all seasonal, part-time, and full-time employees at Dollywood Parks & Resorts. Hosts can enroll in the program on their first day of employment.

""When our hosts strive to grow themselves, it makes our business and our community a truly better place,"" Naughton said.

wc0201,"Taylor Swift's private jets took 170 trips this year, landing her #1 on a new report that tracks the carbon emissions of celebrity private jets","Article: https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/kylies-17-minute-flight-has-nothing-on-the-170-trips-taylor-swifts-private-jets-took-this-year-1390083/

As the world quite literally burns and floods, it’s important to remember that individualism won’t really solve the climate crisis, especially compared to, say, the wholesale dismantling of the brutal grip the fossil fuel industry has on modern society. Still, there are some individuals who could probably stand to do a bit more to mitigate their carbon footprint — among them, the super-wealthy who make frequent use of carbon-spewing private jets. (And let’s not even get started on yachts.)

While private jets are used by rich folks of all kinds, their use among celebrities has come under scrutiny recently, with reports of the likes of Drake and Kylie Jenner taking flights that lasted less than 20 minutes. In response, the sustainability marketing firm Yard put together a new report using data to rank the celebrities whose private jets have flown the most so far this year — and subsequently dumped the most carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. 

Drake and Jenner both appear on the list, but they’re actually nowhere near the top, which is occupied by none other than Taylor Swift. According to Yard, Swift’s jet flew 170 times between Jan. 1 and July 19 (the window for the Yard study), totaling 22,923 minutes, or 15.9 days, in the air. That output has created estimated total flight emissions of 8,293.54 tonnes of carbon, which Yard says is 1,184.8 times more than the average person’s total annual emissions. (At least one more flight can be added to that list, too: The flight-tracking Twitter account Celebrity Jets notes that Swift’s plane flew today, July 29.)

“Taylor’s jet is loaned out regularly to other individuals,” a spokesperson for Swift tells Rolling Stone. “To attribute most or all of these trips to her is blatantly incorrect.”

To create this report, Yard scraped data from Celebrity Jets, which in turn pulls its info from ADS-B Exchange (“the world’s largest public source of unfiltered flight data,” according to its website). Yard based its carbon emissions estimates on a U.K. Department for Transportation estimate that a plane traveling at about 850 km/hour gives off 134 kg of CO2 per hour; that 134 kg estimate was multiplied with both time-spent-in-air and a factor of 2.7 to account for “radiative forcing,” which includes other harmful emissions such as nitrous oxide (2.7 was taken from Mark Lynas’ book Carbon Counter). That number was then divided by 1000 to convert to tonnes. 

Coming in behind Swift’s plane on Yard’s list was an aircraft belonging to boxer Floyd Mayweather, which emitted an estimated 7076.8 tonnes of CO2 from 177 flights so far this year (one of those flights lasted just 10 minutes). Coming in at number three on the list was Jay-Z, though his placement does come with a caveat: The data pulled for Jay is tied to the Puma Jet, a Gulfstream GV that Jay — the creative director for Puma — reportedly convinced the sneaker giant to purchase as a perk for the athletes it endorses.

While Jay-Z is not the only person flying on the Puma Jet, a rep for Yard said, “We attributed the jet to Jay-Z on this occasion because he requested the Puma jet as part of his sign-up deal to become the creative director of Puma basketball. The Puma jet’s tail numbers are N444SC at Jay-Z’s request. N, the standard US private jet registration code, 444, referring to his album of the same name and SC for his birth name, Shawn Carter. Without Jay-Z, this jet would cease to exist.”

The rest of the celebrities in Yard’s top 10 do appear to own the jets that provided the flight data for the report. To that end, though, it’s impossible to say if the specific owners are the ones traveling on these planes for every specific flight. For instance, Swift actually has two planes that CelebJets tracks, and obviously, she can’t be using both at once.

So, beyond the Jay-Z/the Puma Jet, next on Yard’s list is former baseball star Alex Rodriguez’s plane, which racked up 106 flights and emitted 5,342.7 tonnes of CO2. And rounding out the top five is a jet belonging to country star Blake Shelton, which has so far taken 111 flights and emitted 4495 tonnes of CO2. The rest of the Top 10 includes jets belonging to director Steven Spielberg (61 flights, 4,465 tonnes), Kim Kardashian (57 flights, 4268.5 tonnes), Mark Wahlberg (101 flights, 3772.85 tones), Oprah Winfrey (68 flights, 3493.17 tonnes), and Travis Scott (54 flights, 3033.3 tonnes). 

Reps for the other nine celebrities in the top 10 of Yard’s list did not immediately return Rolling Stone’s request for comment. 

As for the two celebs who helped inspire Yard’s study: Kylie Jenner’s jet landed all the way down at number 19 (64 flights, 1682.7 tonnes), sandwiched between Jim Carey and Tom Cruise. And Drake’s plane popped up at number 16 (37 flights, 1844.09 tonnes), in between golfer Jack Nicklaus and Kenny Chesney. While Jenner has yet to address her 17-minute flight, Drake did respond to some criticism on Instagram by noting that nobody was even on the seven-minute, 12-minute, and 14-minute flights his Boeing 767 took during a six-week span. The explanation, in all honesty, doesn’t do him any favors.

“This is just them moving planes to whatever airport they are being stored at for anyone who was interested in the logistics… nobody takes that flight,” Drake said. (A rep for Drake did not immediately return Rolling Stone’s request for further comment.)",1659194955.0,73898.0,4584.0,/r/Music/comments/wc0201/taylor_swifts_private_jets_took_170_trips_this/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/wc0201/taylor_swifts_private_jets_took_170_trips_this/,YoureASkyscraper,Music,0.86,True,False,False,False,0.0,1745869729.09002,Entertainment

71fe3y,TIL about a website called Boil the Frog - put in two artists of different genres and you'll get a Spotify playlist that gradually and seamlessly takes you from point A to point B.,"(inb4 /r/TitleGore)

According to the website itself: Boil the Frog lets you create a playlist of songs that gradually takes you from one music style to another. It's like the proverbial frog in the pot of water. If you heat up the pot slowly enough, the frog will never notice that he's being made into a stew and jump out of the pot. With a Boil the frog playlist you can do the same, but with music. You can generate a playlist that will take the listener from one style of music to the other, without the listener ever noticing that they are being made into a stew.

I'm using it right now for the first time, so I can't really comment on the validity of their claim... but it's certainly a really damn cool idea. I'll give an update if my ""from Maya Jane Coles to Boris"" mix actually worked out.

7ogtkr,Ticketmaster.. I'm trying to buy a $25 ticket to Streetlight Manifesto and you're charging TWENTY DOLLARS in fees... Seriously??,"At this point, I had accepted fees as a fact of life. You want a concert ticket, pay $5 ...maybe $10 in fees. So be it. Sucks. 

But when the ticket price nearly DOUBLES when fees are added, that's just absurd! What is [this](https://i.imgur.com/PDYxoRQ.png) damn $11 service fee for?? And a venue AND an order processing fee?? Who knew the computers handling ticket sales were so expensive to run that you must charge to use them for every single sale. Incredible.

So freaking angry at their stupid fees. My god. Was super pumped to see one of my favorite bands play a classic album from 20 years ago and was willing to travel about 2 hours to go see it (and probably still will) but damn you know how to take advantage of people when there is no other option in place other than physically getting to the venue.

I've been compiling this playlist for 7 years now! I've really tried to keep it impartial, but it'll of course skew slightly to my tastes and my demographic (British, 26, Male).

Hope some of you enjoy the playlist, always gets a room singing along.

Comment if you think I'm missing any songs, or any song doesn't deserve to be in there!

Edit:

Thanks guys, Couldn't be happier that people are enjoying the playlist! I've cleaned up some of the duplicates.

ia3c6o,This subreddit is so unfun and lifeless because of the regulations.,"This goddamn sub pisses me off so much. r/music is supposed to be about talking about music and sharing the music you enjoy with other people. The moderators are authoritarian assholes that go directly against what the sub is for.

qod8ck,The Travis Scott incident perfectly encapsulates the insane ‘celebrity worship’ associated with music. It’s always been like this.,"The fact that this dude has done shit like this MULTIPLE times, is historically known to be a piece of shit, and yet 50,000 people show up to his festivals speaks volumes. Watching [these](https://youtu.be/6rkioecE8E0) videos, it’s so obvious that this guy has 0 empathy. Does anyone think for a second he’s reeling from this? Or is it more likely that he doesn’t give a fuck and is just concerned about the bad PR he’s getting. 

He’ll put out some half-assed apology while he’s stoned and this will be forgotten and happen again in less than a year.  This part of human psychology that makes people idolize these human turds baffles the fuck out of me. 

Rockstars are not gods, people. Judge them for their shitty actions and hold them accountable. 

Does [this](https://youtu.be/eKzcNZ7m43k) look like normal behavior? All to see a shithead.

Also pay close attention to the cult-like vibes of people STILL defending this waste of air.

Edit:
Also those calling me a boomer (I’m 30) and a white nationalist (I’m a minority/POC) for saying celebrity worship is bad just prove my point. Enjoy your hypebeast McDonalds meals, overpriced sweatshop shoes, and shitty life choices homies. Prove your loyalty by being front row at his next concert 🤘

4htudc,"Why isn't there a ""tip jar"" on Spotify? I would gladly pay bands I like $10 or $20 for a record I love, if I knew it went straight to them","Spotify would take a cut, obviously. But even if 80% of it went to the band, it would make a huge difference for struggling artists putting out sick records. 

EDIT 2: WOW! The internet is a cruel, cruel place. Just to be clear - I understand that there are other ways to support artists... including ""buying the record, buying merch, and going to a show"". My point is that most (or at least many) of us no longer care to have LPs, CDs, or even MP3s lying around. I have never used or wanted band merch, and I simply don't get a chance to see bands I really like that often. So my point, once again, was to have a feature to DONATE to the artist (without getting anything physical, in return) through the platform that I listen to music on, which I realize doesn't pay smaller artists that well. 

Also to clarify, I understand that a lot of work goes into writing/recording/putting out a record; in a perfect world, this theoretical donation could be split between the artist and their label/legal/creative team however they saw fit.

to music on which i realize doesnt pay smaller artists that well also to clarify i understand that a lot of work goes into writingrecordingputting out a record in a perfect world this theoretical donation could be split between the artist and their labellegalcreative team however they saw fit edit wow i dont really understand how goldupvotes work i made this post a few days ago and didnt even

gxpjq0,Modern country music is a shell of what it's supposed to be and I understand why so many people hate it.,"I know a lot of people hate the country music genre in general, but modern country is an absolute shell of what country music started as and is supposed to be. You used to be able to have a country song without it including mud, a truck, beer, the mention of cowboy boots or a cornfield. It's supposed to be much more than that and I think if we still had country from the good 'ol days, a lot less people would hate it. Country music is supposed to draw from down to earth living, love of the simple things, living a rural or blue collar life, overcoming struggle, working hard, love, etc just like a lot of other genres. Nowadays you're hard pressed to find a country song that's not part an extremely specific stereotype that's been pumped out for the past decade.

I understand some people are just never going to enjoy or relate to country music and that's fine but Jesus Christ let's stop acting like 85% of these modern artists are country. ""Hick"" would be a more appropriate name for this genre. It's the Party Down South types who think wearing a camouflage tank top and enjoying fishing is an identity. Singing about drinking, driving a truck in the mud, having a dog and a pretty blonde girlfriend to the twang of an acoustic guitar don't equate to a country lifestyle or music. These people took the soul out of country and killed the genre. 

Loretta Lynn. Dolly Parton. Johnny Cash. The Carter Family. Hank Williams. Merle Haggard. George Jones. Glen Campbell. Waylon Jennings. Patsy Cline. THEY are country, when it was still a respectable and relatable genre. The majority of what's released today under the 'country' label is a slap in the face to all of them. Modern ""country singers"" turned the genre into a joke.

Now, I'm not saying there are zero good country artists today. I have a few faves. But most of them just have seemed to complete miss the point of country music.

posting this very late the movie is almost two years old but i love it and wanted to share my thoughts and opinions on it nothing stated here is going to be a new revelation or a new discussion point that hasnt been brought up already but i want to know your thoughts on my thoughts you may disagree with some of my views but thats also why i wanted to share this to hear your opinions on it all fission and fusion oppenheimer and strauss alienation flipflopping and martyrdom oppenheimer and strauss are introduced right after one another as two sides of the same bomb they are both prideful men who went slighted will respond in different but similar explosive ways oppenheimer when made a fool of in front of his fellow peers by his instructor patrick blackett chooses to inject the instructors apple full of cyanide as revenge this response by oppenheimer shows that he is impulsive enough to attempt murder when his ego is damaged in front of his peers in my opinion it also shows that he does not think before he speaks that he does not think about the consequences of his actions in a sensible manner the next morning he goes to stop the apple from being eaten by his instructor patrick blackett but neils bohr who was not his intended target almost eats it oppenheimer created an object of death then regrets it when it is almost too late and almost kills someone who was not its intended target this happens to him as a relatively young student and throughout the movie he personally passes this act of humiliation on to his peers on multiple occasions this comes to bite him in the ass like a snake in your toilet oppenheimer has no filter in his thoughts and actions throughout the film all of this adds up and ultimately causes him to lose his security clearance and the privileges that come with it on multiple occasions oppenheimer humiliates his peers whether it be intentional or unintentional and this causes a chain reaction throughout his life that causes his own destruction the people who hurt oppenheimers security clearance case is someone who oppenheimer has humiliated first and foremost is strauss obviously strauss is someone who wanted to be respected amongst his peers but had an inferiority complex that is apparent throughout the film this inferiority complex caused even the slightest remarks to be perceived as personal attacks to his ego and place amongst his peers im not saying that there were not blatant slights made towards strauss for example when oppenheimer makes a fool of strauss in front of their peers during the shipping of isotope discussion however there are relatively little things that added up over time that strauss held internally until it was let loose in an explosive manner concocting the security clearance case against oppenheimer throughout the film these perceived slights included a insisting to be called admiral strauss when called mr strauss by his senate aide b responding to being called once lowly shoe salesman by oppenheimer and then correcting him saying no just a shoe salesman c at the aec gathering discussing the spy and filter paper detecting a russian atomic weapon strauss tries to give his thoughts to oppenheimer on what the committee should do regarding this but oppenheimer disregards him and doesnt even look at him when saying that strauss is not on the advisory committee and that he essentially has no say on the outcome d at strausss birthday celebration when strauss approaches oppenheimer at the bar with his son and fiancée oppenheimer doesnt even give them the time of day and essentially ignores them e the whole oppenheimer and einstein misunderstanding strauss thought oppenheimer soured einstein on strauss when in actuality something more important was going through their minds in actuality in was nothing personal towards strauss now i am not saying that strauss is entirely wrong in all of his perceptions of these actions and events strauss has a right to be called admiral being called a lowly is hurtful not getting looked in the eye by your peer and straightup dismissed of your opinion in hurtful having your son and his fiancée essentially ignored on your huge birthday celebration is wrong and having one of if not the the most respected scientist in the world einstein not evening look or respond to you must sting terribly when you hold that person in the highest regard what i am saying is that these things were blown out of proportion by strauss and some of these slights had nothing to do with strauss at all at strausss birthday celebration he thinks oppenheimer is indifferent towards his son and fiancée because he is preoccupied on the fact that it was revealed that there was a spy at los alamos and that oppenheimer was pissed at being wrong about that and pissed that strauss was right about that but in actuality oppenheimer was pissed about the hbomb program going forward oppenheimer still should have congratulated the engaged couple it would have been the easy and right thing to do especially if it was strausss son and on strausss birthday event but oppenheimer decided to be rude the oppenheimer and einstein discussion where strauss felt that oppenheimer soured einstein on strauss had nothing to do with strauss at all they just got done talking about how they might have cause a chain reaction that destroys the world their minds were preoccupied on that einstein had nothing against strauss obviously but strauss didnt see it that way any slight was internalized overthought and held tightly together and let out in an unhealthy way lastly oppenheimer alienated his peers throughout the film has conflicting thoughts and actions and plays a martyr throughout alienations oppenheimer on multiple occasions alienates himself from strauss mentioned above oppenheimer alienates himself from edward teller this is done by making teller feel foolish when teller brought up the creation of a fusion bomb but also on the multiple occasions where teller wants to know oppenheimers thoughts on the bomb but was never given a straight answer oppenheimer cheats on his wife with jean tatlock but also with ruth tolman ruth was richard tolmans wife and strauss tells ernest lawrence richards friend that oppenheimer was having an affair with richards wife which led to the death of richard this is one of the reasons why lawrence was going to speak against oppenheimer lawrence also sees the how oppenheimer disrespects his peers at the aec filter paper meeting and even attempts to call him out on it flipflopping and playing the martyr oppenheimer attempts to kill his instructor but says he didnt hate him and that he liked him very much to jean tatlock he insists at los alamos to call what theyre building a gadget but when its announced that the atom has been split he immediately makes the bomb connection oppenheimer knows what he is building he knows what it will do and he tries to convince himself that the bombs creation is an inevitability which personally i agree with he knows that the bomb must be built before the nazis build it he knows it will be used a weapon of mass destruction but he cannot come to terms with that after its use he feels like he has blood on his hands because he led the invention of this weapon but he liked the fame power and privileges that leading the creation of the bomb provided neils bohr states this theme when he tells oppenheimer that he cannot lift the stone without being ready for the snake that is revealed oppenheimer is haunted throughout the film by the bomb and what it will do the power it will bring and the mass destruction it will cause but the idea of being a bringer of death a godlike figure gets him off as strauss said oppenheimer wanted to be remembered as the leader in creating one of the most important inventionsweapons in history but not remembered for the lives that his creation took oppenheimer wants to have his cake and eat it too he wants to cheat on his wife but is distraught and wants to be comforted when his infidelity adds to the death of jean tatlock kitty tells him to his face that he cant commit the sin and then expect people to feel sorry for him kitty also states that oppenheimer enduring the security clearance ambush is a way for him to feel like a martyr to accept the punishment for the culmination of his actions oppenheimer knows what an atomic bomb will do but he spearheads its creation and then he feels like he has blood on his hands and wants people to feel sorry for him he wants people to tell him that there was no choice but to build the bomb and that he wasnt responsible for all the deaths while at the same time enjoying the perks of being responsible for the creation of the bomb when dropping off his son peter at chevaliers he says he knows that he is a terrible person and pauses because he wants to hear from chevalier that he is not a terrible person and that what he is doing is necessary in my opinion chevalier only accepted taking oppenheimers and kittys son in because chevalier wanted to stay on oppenheimers good side in order to pass on los alamos info to the russians at the end both oppenheimer and strauss share similar fates they are both denied what they are after oppenheimer does not get his security clearance approved and strauss is denied his cabinet position the cause boils down to each man alienating their peers oppenheimer is shown to do this time and time again throughout the film and strausss avarice towards oppenheimer is obvious to those in the scientific community who are paying attention to the situation to those whose minds arent clouded by pettiness david hill played by rami malek has little screen time in the movie but his role in my opinion is one of the most interesting even though hill was treated with disrespect by oppenheimer the first two times we see him in the movie oppenheimer knocks his pen down in one scene then his clipboard down in his next scene hill comes to oppenheimers defense in his third scene hill states that strauss has a vendetta against oppenheimer hill is able to see the bigger picture and not focus on these relatively small slights and hill doesnt try to get revenge on oppenheimer even though his only interactions with him were ones of disrespect i think hill is the level headed character to which oppenheimer and strauss should be compared he is doing what is best for the scientific community without letting personal feelings get in the way of doing what is right tldr this was mainly a summary with some opinions included i wanted to highlight how the film shows the nuances and actions that added up over a long period of time and led to major defeats in the lives of oppenheimer and strauss i understand this included a lot of obvious retelling of what occurred in the movie but i wanted to put it together in summary form oppenheimer and strausss desire to feel important and respected and their paths to achieve this are similar in a tragic way i believe this movie deserved all the praise and rewards it achieved and i think christopher nolan did a great job telling this story in three hours,,,,,

the running moments in his filmography earlier this year in anticipation of the release of mission impossible the final reckoning i decided to rank all of tom cruises running scenes in the mi franchise id worked on several mi data pieces for various companies and figured it would be easy to rank the ish running moments when the list was completed it felt incomplete so i decided to rank all of the running scenes in his filmography starting with s endless love and finishing with s mission impossible dead reckoning cruise had gone to extreme lengths for his films so i decided to honor his hard work by putting together this absurd list quick note his x handle always makes me laugh heres what you need to know about the list i found and ranked moments i counted running sprinting and jogging the amount of time doesnt matter either in top gun theres a onesecond shot of him running to hit a volleyball it was included a short blurb was included for list items timestamps have been included for the top some of the timestamps may be a little off for you it depends on wherehow you watch the movies for me it was a mixture of dvds blurays vudu and streaming channels i researched the top scenes and wrote more about them and included youtube links this list is obviously subjective but after going through cruises filmography for the fourth time since i am very happy with the top there is zero chance that our lists will match up so dont be surprised if the moments dont line up with your list for some of the scenes i split them up into moments i just went with the flow of the scene and if he stops for a moment or the scene cuts to someone else i split up the running moment into parts if youre interested in learning more about the top and this list i recorded a podcast episode about the data collection and ranking process its fun you should listen to it the podcast is called movies films and flix you can find it wherever you listen to podcasts i also have a show called deep blue sea the podcast that you should listen to as well heres the list losin it quick moment featuring cruise starting to run losin it he runs to get into a car losin it while being chased by some people he runs to the convertible again top gun he runs to hit a volleyball mission impossible ii cruise runs up some stairs top gun quick run before going up some steps days of thunder jogs through a parking garage to catch nicole kidman the firm stair running legend hell prison crouched jogging the mummy cruise runs to his horse mission impossible dead reckoning a little bit of running

out of a hospital and across an overpass when he starts running i dont think hell ever look faster on screen edge of tomorrow arrest this man in an alltimer cruise moment he tries to escape arrest and it ends badly youtube clip moments before brendan gleesons character yells arrest this man tom cruise delivers an alltimer cruise moment in which this dialogue is delivered i just inspired millions of people to join your army and when the body bags come home and theyre looking for someone to blame how hard do you think it would be for me to convince people to blame you id imagine the general would prefer to avoid that cruise enters gleesons office with total confidence and he quickly becomes a slimy rat whose escape attempt ends quickly its perfect and it makes his heroic transformation more interesting director doug liman did a great job weaponizing cruises charm in this scene and its fun watching a guy who cant escape an office building becoming a worldsaving soldier the firm the final chase scene he runs jumps goes up steps and this is when we get to see his true breakaway speed and hes holding a briefcase youtube clip the firm is cruises first film to fully showcase his soontobefamous running form elbows and knees we get a glimpse of it at the minute mark when hes chasing down jeannie tripplehorn but its not until the climactic chase that we see his breakaway speed for several minutes as hes running away from tobin jigsaw bell far and away in a neat transition cruise starts running so fast that the next shot is of an explosion talk about explosive running youtube clip i love how ron howard cuts from a sprinting tom cruise to an explosion its silly and it always puts a smile on my face i also love that the movie ends with the land run of mission impossible rogue nation cruise wipes out while trying to jump over a car it is very funny and the mi score helps make it better youtube clip this is mission impossible i cant just cross a street and get in a car mcquarrie talking about a conversation he had with cruise on the rogue nation commentary when putting together the top i always knew that this threesecond moment would be included its a silly moment punctuated by cheeky musical accompaniment and it proves that cruise doesnt take himself seriously its made even better by the knowledge that cruise came up with this bit on the day and he surprised the crew with his illfated car jump also the ensuing dialogue what are you talking about is delightful at this point in his career cruise was on a hot streak and its fun knowing that he was still totally down to make himself look like a dork mission impossible fallout iconic run across the building punctuated by a beautiful tracking shot dude looks amazing and he almost catches cavill youtube clip i loved doing this but it hurt tom cruise fallout bluray commentary watching cruise run across the blackfriars railway bridge is an alltimer cruise moment for multiple reasons it looks great and is a perfect trailer moment im jumping out of a window great line i love the reaction he gets from the people in the office they tom was still recovering from the ankle break he suffered during a jump gone awry director christopher mcquarrie said he was going for it the score rules its a bit gratuitous but the running makes sense in regards to the story mission impossible cruise runs from an exploding restaurant and does his first i look awesome while running in an action film work lots of fish die youtube clip that one was particularly very crazy talking about the scene on the graham norton show tom cruise was already a big star in but this moment made him a gigantic action movie star he had been in top gun sitting in a plane legend lots of rolling and crouch running days of thunder more sitting far and away boxing and the outsiders fisticuffs but mission impossible saw him entering a new phase of his career this moment was everywhere in and its one of the most iconic images of the mission impossible franchise it gets added points because the stunt looks legitimately dangerous and features some solid arm work from tom risky business a cigarettesmoking cruise wearing sunglasses at night runs up to some teenagers while the song mannish boy plays on the soundtrack this is the moment when cruise became tom cruise youtube clip starts at seconds wearing a suit coat black shirt black sunglasses and puffing on a cigarette cruise is strutting down the street and runs up to a group of classmates the moment lasts only seven seconds but its a turning point for cruise also the song selection is perfect vanilla sky cruise runs through an empty times square youtube clip the groundwork for the times square running in vanilla sky was set up in the film jerry maguire in the cameron crowedirected movie cruise dramatically runs through an airport and it looks great years later while filming vanilla sky crowe and cruise pulled some strings with the city of new york and were able to close down times square for three hours on a sunday morning in november the idea was that cruises character hates being alone and he dreams that hes alone in one of the busiest places in the world its total vanity but i love that cruise has a running scene in an empty times square collateral he throws a chair through a glass window then wipes out on the chair and just keeps running its his most aggressive running ever youtube clip starts at collateral not only features the best sitting performance of tom cruises career it also features his most aggressive running toms character vincent is a straightup killer and its fun watching cruise as he fully commits to being a coyote who chases down his prey with lightningfast footwork theres a moment towards the end when vincent is chasing down max and annie jada pinkett smith running in heels and he takes a chair to smash a window so he can run through it however cruise mistimedmisjudged the chairs trajectory and he wiped out on the chair and fell to the ground the neat thing is that he springs up immediately and keeps running its a perfect showcase for cruises tenacity and toughness and i love that the unplanned moment made its way into the film and so does mann who felt like it added to the realism of collateral its a secondslong moment but i love that nothing can stop cruise from running mission impossible iii cruise runs across some rooftops and then he sprints through a shanghai fishing village youtube clip in cruise had been running in movies for years and had some memorable sprints in war of the worlds the firm minority report collateral and far and away however his sprinting in mi which took takes to get perfect made people sit up and realize they were witnessing cinematic running history its the fastest cruise has ever looked and the spidercam rig that was built for the scene works perfectly as it tracks alongside cruise as he damn near goes plaid on the

we have a situation of what we call in hebrew a generation who knew not their forebearers i often chuckle when people wax lyrical about oh paul atreidis story is a subversion of the heros journey or michael corleone is such an antihero and im left thinking fancy words we have had a term for that for two milennia its greek tragedy well the same applies to the dreaded term fan service its a term i never use because it takes something which had long been the currency in drama the callback or recurring motif and bastardizes it into something derogatory for no apparent reason in older forms of storytelling callbacks have indeed been a part of storytelling for very long indeed greek dramas sometimes repeated lines somewhere during the play or even across a trilogy of plays like the oresteia much later wagner did it for his ring heres wotan sir donald mcintyre the flying dutchman selfloathingly bequeating the world to the unborn hagen the nibelung son and heres hagen two dramas later calling himself nibelung son to the same notes it had appeared in literature quite often proust is especially notorious for having recurring motifs all through his à la recherche du temps perdu the phone constantly ringing the repeated allusions to pink and muave colours and much else beside in film callbacks have obviously been used in films people can philosophize about the appearance of oranges across all three godfather films and how they symbolize death but ultimately what all of these appearances amount to is a callback between the three films callbacks are also used within the span of a single film they dont even have to be lines they can be visuals for example sir sam mendes opens and ends by reproducing the very same shot red appears all through the sixth sense as all allusion to things touched by the undead this example is especially valuable because it engages with the underlying conceptual ideas behind the story these two shots from fellowship of the ring and the return of the king mirror each other theyre especially pervasive in soundtracks in revenge of the sith when anakin remembers giving padme the pendant from the phantom menace john williams plays the theme of the boy anakin when bilbo baggins recovers from his hrraagh moment the music is similar to when galadriel is coming down from her nuclear mode literally every time a theme like the socaled force theme or imperial march play it is a form of a callback and yet what seems par for the course on the soundtrack to a film for example causes some people to cry fan service like bloody murder when it is done in dialogue curious the function of the callback in all these cases and many others like them the callbacks serve a structural function they tie the piece together artists at least as far back as aristotle have strived towards greater and greater unity in a work of art and at the inverse of that to this day we often criticise films when we feel that they are too piecemeal in the th century writers spoke of this practice as a red thread that runs through the piece alluding to ariadnes red thread guiding theseus through the labyrinth carl maria von weber praised perhaps a little overlyenthusiastically ludewig spohrs faust for having certain melodies running through the whole like delicate threads and lending it a sense of artistic unity callbacks can also create powerful parallels and juxtapositions in the batman begins example above the fact that the first is rachel telling bruce and the second is the disguised bruce telling it back to rachel is meaningful on several levels not least because it allows her to realize whos under the mask but also because youre made to think back to a point in the film in which rachel and bruce were quite estranged but again what works for a single film is somehow derided as fan service when its done in a series of films even when they tell the same story in that sense callbacks are a close cousin to mechanism of setup and payoff obviously a returning line doesnt always function like a setuppayoff structure but sometimes it does furthermore often when there is a long span of time between a setup and its payoff even in a single movie the writer may insert any number of reminders to the setup thats entirely normal screenwriting procedure im trying not to fall into george lucas maxim of its like poetry it rhymes and ring theory and all this stuff because that implies a kind of more rigorous structural parity than most films including lucas owns aim for much less achieve this sort of thing was attempted in the th century where people attempted to make entire acts of dramas mirror each other in form and create palindromic aa or ternary aba forms weve generally moved away from this kind of thing in the interest of greater realism and film in particular tends to be a little looser structurally outside of arthouse exotica like satantango that sort of thing can also come too close to pastiche you cant in good faith excuse the force awakens or even return of the jedi for replaying entire swathes of star wars as a kind of structural exercise in parallelism nevertheless callbacks can create a feeling of a larger structure especially if theyre interspersed evenly through the entire work from start to finish like a web that holds the piece together in an unexpected journey the map transition from hobbiton to erebor mirrors partially thanks to the music the map transition from minas tirith back to the shire in the return of the king creating two bookends over the largest scope will people remember its not clear but artists have long believed that the way these things accumulate will at least get to us on a subliminal level at worse it can be regarded as something the artist does for his own artistic satisfaction like how kubrick would put things into drawers that would never be opened oncamera just so that the feel of the room was right to him but even barring these more complex uses of callbacks to tie the work together or create a sense of parallelism a callback can simply work as well a callback like the refrain in a song even on that most basic level it helps keep the thing feeling of a piecelike red threads tying knots through the piece callbacks in a film series seen as one long film obviously the extent to which a whole batch of films in a series are of a piece is contentious but i do feel like if youre a filmmaker embarking on or participating in the making of a film series especially one that has a central storyline like harry potter or star wars then it only makes sense for you to treat it as one giant story told in parts quite how succesfull that endeavour may or may not turn out is another thing but as a working premise its surely a good one to follow again under the aegis of the artistic ideal of unity in his directors commentary to an unexpected journey over a shot of narsil sir peter jackson says it will come to have a very big significance in the later trilogy even if people dont actually watch it in that order and many people will i do think that they will subliminaly be impressed with the conscientiousness that went into making it feel like one long film taking that line of thought of treating a film series with a single storyline as though it were one giant movie told in parts further some setups seem downright essential again in a single long movie you wouldnt want important characters or storylines to drop out of the story for too long only to then loop back in and you dont want to introduce characters or other narrative elements for the first time unless its fairly early in the piece otherwise it feels like a hail mary using subtle callbacks can help avoid these two traps within the longer span alloted by an extended film series see how chamber of secret subtly setsup the hurcruxes for the halfblood prince for all these reasons i think callbacks are a valuable tool and entirely par for the course in a film series thats why i never use the term fan service but it is being willfully oblivious to the benefits of callbacks and to the long storytelling tradition that they embody thats not to say all callbacks are equally succesfull if it all callbacks can anticipate later moments in a way that takes the edge of them when they actually happen in jrr tolkien objected to a story treatment for lord of the rings that by transporting gandalf across middleearth on an eagle he felt ruined the surprise of seeing the eagle rescue gandalf from orthanc similar arguments had been made that seeing jabba the hutt inserted into the original star wars in the special edition ruins the effect of finally seeing him in return of the jedi after hed been talked about all this time in those cases you might want something more subtle and subliminal for example in silence of the lambs as clarice admires the painting in lecters cell he says its the duomo as seen from the belvedere later buffalo bill is found in belvedere california this is not to say that lecter is knowingly alluding to gumbs location from the beginning but that its a device the writers use that when the name belvedere comes up again a part of us goes i know what that is ive heard that before and this helps with the sense of unity the ability of callbacks to create parallels and juxtapositions can also kind of expose weaknesses the callbacks in spectre to vesper from casino royale cause audiences to juxtapose vesper with madeleine youre left thinking just how much more impactful that relationship was then the one in the mendes film alas certainly in the attempt to make disparate films work together as a piece a callback can only underpin just how differently the films actually feel star wars is particularly guilty of this i personally have never able to in watching something like return of the jedi find myself really thinking about the lloydchristensen anakin and having my experience of the jonesprowse vader be informed by what befell them the films just dont feel cohesive enough for that and so lucas attempts to create a callback by having vader cry out noooo fall particularly flat in some cases the attempts at a callback exposes continuity headscratchers bringing back the lars homestead in attack of the clones with cpo already in the familys service does bring into question the fact that cpo is clearly a stranger to owen in the original star wars you can find ways to explain it from blinkered memory to cpos being a common model of droid and him getting his golden covering to owen just messing with him but ideally a movie series shouldnt put you in a position of doing homework to explain disrepancies obviously when a film series doesnt really have a central storyline the need for callbacks is not so great subsequently ive never warmed to temple of doom calling back to indy shooting the swordsman from raiders the fact that temple of doom nominally takes place before raiders hardly helps but even here it is valuable to tie the films together at least stylistically and so at least some amount of callbacks is stillwell called for how i learned to stop worrying and enjoy the callbacks but none of these bad examples make the habit of callbacks a malpractice as the ewww fan service crowd will lead you to believe as with any narrative device it can work well less well or not work at all but its still a legitimate widelyaccepted and longrunning storytelling tool and potentially a very powerful one there are lot of prequels sequels and spinoff coming out in the next few years and for all i care they can fill them to the brim with callbacks bring it on,,,,,

justin cornwell logline after a drug deal gone wrong a bruised detective must fight his way through the criminal underworld to rescue a politicians estranged son unravelling a deep web of corruption and conspiracy that ensnares his entire city rotten tomatoes metacritic some reviews the hollywood reporter david rooney with hardy in fine form at the wheel havoc knows what its audience wants it also looks great with regular evans dp matt flannerys dynamic cameras zipping in and out of the bloody fray and textured visuals slashed with throbbing colors the setting is a city so grim and seedy it seems to exist only at night the fact that the environments were mostly constructed at a studio in cardiff suggests theres lots of ace craftspeople hiding out in wales slashfilm chris evangelista to be clear i love a good violent action movie as much as the next dude but you have to give me something more than just one extreme shootout followed by another perhaps if the hyperviolence was a little more stylized it would play better instead its just ugly stuff repeated in numbing fashion by the time havoc ended i felt as exhausted as hardys beaten and bruised character i suppose evans and company deserve some credit for making an action movie that really leans into the brutality but theres only so much of that you can put up with before it starts to grow tedious variety peter debruge theres a reason bigstudio producers looked to sundance darlings like colin trevorrow rian johnson and jon watts to handle their tentpoles not because those guys are great at action but because they keep the interpersonal dynamics interesting thats precisely where evans wreaks the most havoc ignoring or simply not understanding what connects us to such characters in the first place and therefore ensuring that his unwieldy netflix vehicle is dead on arrival nextbestpicture giovanni lago after years of waiting it feels like havoc was never going to reach the preconceived levels of hype that it was supposed to live up to its clear that whenever certain moments were filmed years later than the original period of principal photography mainly due to hardys more than apparent changes in beard thickness theres doubt it made any real difference in the final cut that evans envisioned still when havoc hits it only reminds us how awesome it feels when evans gets to do his own thing even a flawed gareth evans film satisfies more than most action flicks today empire beth webb theres also something refreshingly egoless to it hardy may have top billing but takes not only many sucker punches to the face but an entire roof to the head around him evans utilities his full cast throwing greener actors like quelin sepulveda who plays charlies partner mia into the eye of the storm armed with a meat cleaver and a mission to survive the result is a throbbing bonecrunching diorama of violence with the occasional horrifying glorious flourish youll never want to see a fishing harpoon again slant magazine jake cole instead of elaborate exchanges of closequarters strikes and counters the characters here tend to get the upper hand based on who has the quickest reflexes in tackling an assailant or getting a block up at the last possible second despite the advanced choreography that evans and flannery capture with a generally superior sense of visual fluidity than they displayed in the raid movies theres an overwhelming sense of chaos here that feels realistic nick schager the daily beast havoc is such relentless hardhearted business that the squeamish need not enlist nonetheless those with a hankering for escalating insanity will be well satiated by this saga whose narrative convolutions are untangled in a second half that puts a premium on combat disappointingly evans who wrote the script shortchanges olyphant in a role thats barely onedimensional and receives no standout momentsto a large extent because he shares only scant screen time with hardy the director makes up for it however with a barrage of broken bones and mutilated corpsesand set pieces drenched in slow motion and decorated with flying glass splinter and bodily debristhat tips the material into sensoryoverload territory collider tania hussain havoc might deliver on its promise of blood guts and glory but its these committed performances that keep it from completely collapsing under its selfinduced chaos while the vision by evans swings hard as a stylishly savage brawler it rarely lands with meaning which also feels like an injustice to the filmmakers incredible past work despite a toptier cast and bonerattling action to keep you engaged the netflix flick buckles under a cluttered story with chaotic execution its watchable even entertaining in bursts but beneath all the bruises and broken bones theres not much else to hold onto indiewire david ehrlich b rote as evans plot might be and wasteful as its treatment of certain characters definitely is pour one out for jessie mei li whose screen time as walkers new partner greatly outweighs her purpose to the story he has a welldeveloped ear for icecold gangster speak and he isnt afraid to make people pay a steep price for their penance its enough to forgive him andor the movie gods for making us wait so long to see him do it again,,,,,

english teachers everywhere took a teaching break during classics week and showed their students the nbcproduced armand assante version of the odyssey which was a superfun and mostly accurate depiction of the classic greek myth i have it on dvd where else have we seen the odyssey retold everywhere what springs to mind immediately are a pair of excellent films cold mountain and oh brother where art thou and a notasexcellentbutstillfun blockbuster troy more of the iliad but whatever and now we have the return in which an independent film studio and a european director use one of cinemas greatest actors to savingprivateryanize the story of odysseus i thought it worked wonderfully and the films emphasis on cinematography quiet moments nature and intensity were a refreshing break from normal hollywood bullshit the last movie i watched was the gorge so i admit to being biased in favor of something that doesnt completely suck possible spoilers for a yearold story ahead i come at this from someone who loves to read and watch films so just a fan im not an industry man not published never been to film school i have read some complaints about the returns pacing and some weak moments of dialogue i will not refute these complaints but i will just say they must have skipped right over me i was so immersed in the story and so athome with the movies strippeddown nature i found myself quite comfortable with less and never wanting for more the movie is carried almost entirely by ralph fiennes and juliette binoche and all you really need to do to understand whats going on is to watch their eyes i will say i thought the film struggled with the story of telemachus and what to actually do with him but the abandoned son of the king is supposed to be a little outofwhack isnt he anyway demythologizing so the movies main thing is the demythologizing of the story of odysseus instead of being captured and toyed with by the gods for a decade hes just been off somewhere too ashamed to come home without his men and too tormented by the killing hes done living with the trauma of war fiennes has a fantastic yard stare to bring this home especially when his blue eyes shine through a blood mask though this may be a toomodern condition to apply to a yearold story would a feeling of war guilt be anachronistic to ancient times maybe maybe not i do remember seeing a bible meets history show once in which they theorized joshua rested the israelites after each battle during the conquest of canaan for psychological reasons as they were slaughtering the women and children too anachronistic or not the deposit of values into different times makes for good art the mythology is beautifully hinted at during this movie of course i saw another post from months ago pointing out odysseuss answer of nobody when asked who he is and it comes back in the final battle not in the form of gods or magic but in his mythological prowess as a combatant when he slays an entire room of enemies sexuality part of the demythologizing of odysseus comes in the form of rumor on the island telemachus discovers his father has been living on an island with a woman the myth has odysseus captured by calypso and circe with whom he stays for years and fathers children the movie instead leaves this open to interpretation in our demythologized telling of the story we must assume odysseus was just out there shacking up in shame until he got the stones to come home we also have to make some guesses about penelopes sexuality the suitors allege shes either sleeping with one of their number or furiously masturbating and the movie doesnt really attempt to clear her name we can assume shes still being faithful to odysseus and is sexually frustrated this seems like the obvious takeaway as the movie gives us two scenes of her walking through the halls at night and being overcome with emotionlonging as she watches her serving girls fuck the suitors however she also does not hesitate to offer herself to antinous when he threatens her son as if having sex with him would just be another romp since this movie is all about humanizing mythology i think we can assume neither odysseus nor penelope has been completely faithful during their separation i think they hint this to each other during the bath scene at the end also juliette binoche has got to be the hottest yearold on the planet blood this movie is awash in blood appropriate for our warshocked odysseus the sea often appears to be dark and murky as though filled with blood characters shed it profusely odysseus wears it hard its interesting how often this movie mixes blood and water there are several shots of blood seeping into water from various wounds and the sea after all is the vehicle which took away the islands men so its a bloody place to them odysseus wears blood in various amounts throughout the movie despite numerous attempts to rest and recuperate and clean up he always seems to be bloody somewhere on his body and its not until the end when we get that closing shot of the blood spreading into the water that he is able to truly come clean and thats the big moment for the return odysseus comes clean about his life his experiences his infidelity everything,,,,,

1jtyamn,,,,,,,,,movies,,,,,,,,Entertainment & Pop Culture,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2025-04-07 22:32:07,april box office recap a minecraft movie massively overperforms debuting with a colossal million domestically worldwide it earned million the second biggest debut for a video game movie after some very weak months the box office finally picked up steam with april and thats practically all because of a minecraft movie which overcame months of negative buzz to deliver a record opening weekend for a video game adaptation as well as the biggest debut of the year the top earned a combined million this weekend thats up a massive from last year when godzilla x kong the new empire stayed on top while monkey man and the first omen underwhelmed debuting atop wbs a minecraft movie surpassed all expectations earning a colossal million in theaters thats even bigger than wbs barbie million and its only behind harry potter and the deathly hallows part million for the studios biggest debut the opening is also higher than the previous video game record the super mario bros movie million although mario debuted on a wednesday and burned off demand simply put its a fantastic film especially after months of negative buzz surrounding the films trailers and a much needed win for wb after a slate of disappointing performers like joker war of the rohirrim companion and the alto knights back in september when the teaser trailer debuted the film earned poor reception with many criticizing the vfx to win over audiences for the other trailers studio marketing suits added more vfx and quelled rabid fans by conveying that their minecraft will stay true to the game but thats perhaps the key people will talk badly about a product but that buzz translates into awareness which builds into curiosity of course not all negative buzz translates into curiosity snow white waving in the distance but the advantage for this film is simply minecraft despite the belief that the game lost relevance years ago the stats say otherwise minecraft is the bestselling video game of all time with over million copies sold and nearly million monthly active players as of clearly theres already an audience awaiting for a film and they happily paid tickets for this even lukewarm reviews on rt didnt dissuade fans from checking it out according to warner bros of the audience was male and was under years old they gave it a middling b on cinemascore which is very mediocre for a family film while word of mouth among children is very positive adults are less thrilled with the film well see in subsequent weeks how much it drops but for now a million domestic total is in the cards for a minecraft movie last weeks champ a working man added million this weekend thats a drop which is slightly worse than beekeepers drop of course that film had incredibly weak competition but its a sign that the film might not be able to leg out as hoped through days the film has amassed million and it should finish with around million domestically in third place the chosen last supper part earned million this weekend thats down from part s performance last week lets see how part fares this weekend with the arrival of a big blockbuster snow white had another terrible drop this weekend it fell a rough earning just million this weekend the films legs appear to be running out through days the film has earned a terrible million and its gonna finish with less than million domestically thats absolutely pathetic blumhouses the woman in the yard added million this weekend thats a drop which isnt that bad considering the films poor word of mouth through days the film has earned million and it should pass million by next week death of a unicorn earned million this weekend thats a drop which is quite rough for a comedy through days the film has earned just million and it will struggle to get to million by the end of its run with the arrival of part the chosen last supper part collapsed a horrible this weekend earning just million that took its domestic lifetime to million after days there was another wide release this weekend neons hell of a summer debuting in theaters it earned an okay million with weak word of mouth and horrorthriller competition on the way its gonna disappear quickly from theaters in ninth place bleecker streets the friend expanded to theaters and earned million this weekend rounding up the top was captain america brave new world which fell and added million this weekend the films domestic total stands at million and it will crack the million milestone sometime this week overseas a minecraft movie also took over the rest of the world the film earned a huge million overseas for a million worldwide debut thats the second biggest debut for a video game movie behind mario the best debuts were in the uk m china m mexico m germany m and australia m it still has other markets left including japan well see if the film can be strong enough to hit the billion mark snow white is running out of steam and its already its third week it added just million overseas which takes its worldwide total to a terrible million films that ended their run this week none this weekend were getting four wide releases and none stand a chance in dethroning minecraft the first is th century studios the amateur which stars rami malek as a cia cryptographer who seeks revenge against his wifes killers with a working man slowing down this could be a main attraction for oldschool action fans another release is universalblumhouses drop which stars meghann fahy as a widow who is contacted by a stranger to kill her date or her family will be murdered the film already premiered at sxsw and it has received strong reviews on rt can it be the hit that blumhouse wants and needs another is as warfare which follows in realtime a platoon of navy seals on a mission through insurgent territory in its directed by both ray mendoza and alex garland although the latter states his role is more secondary and it has earned great reviews so far on rt its unreasonable to expect numbers similar to civil war but perhaps it could be a surprise breakout for a and finally theres angel studios the king of kings an animated film about the life of jesus christ angel studios has delivered a big marketing for the film and presales are reportedly strong here maybe it could surprise ____________________________________________________________________________________________ if youre interested in following the box office come join us in rboxoffice,,,,,

wonderland that thrives on imagination to get back home theyll have to master the terrain while embarking on a magical quest with an unexpected crafter named steve rotten tomatoes metacritic some reviews the national william mullaly while many bad films are made with love sequels spinoffs and bigbudget adaptations often make the artform feel inert because they are produced with so little heart that they might as well have been generated by ai but heres the thing i actually liked a minecraft movie im as surprised as you are this is not a disaster not by a mile in fact for most of its duration its downright charming and in parts had me laughing out loud variety owen glieberman watching a minecraft movie were always aware that the story is something thats been grafted onto the world and that we dont have much of a dramatic stake in it that its just the films way of cobbling together something that works which in its way is very minecraft some of this is amusing but like the rest of a minecraft movie it never feels like it matters yet its no insult to say that in this case thats actually true to the spirit of a video game that turns life into a blockhead version of itself the hollywood reporter lovia gyrakye the most disappointing aspect of a minecraft movie directed by the husbandwife duo who go by jared hess napoleon dynamite nacho libre isnt that its born out of an existing ip we live in a world of loweffort reboots unnecessary remakes and movies operating as extensions of corporate brands another one of these gluttonous projects is hardly surprising what makes a minecraft movie so dispiriting is how it fails to spark the imagination betraying a core tenet of the game on which its based the wrap michael ordona the most accurate summation of a minecraft movie is probably it is what it is its what its supposed to be it probably wont dig up many new converts to the game but should strike boxoffice silver at least and fans be sure to stick around for two credits scenes especially the second one indiewire david ehrlich c its a real credit to blacks irrepressibly unique comic energy that a minecraft movie never feels quite as hypocritical as it should either disastrously illsuited for its message about how money is the enemy of joy or immaculately wellsuited for its message about much harder it is to build things than it is to destroy them hess film cant help but feel like its very existence is an affront to the creative freedom that has allowed minecraft to become such a vital form of selfexploration for kids around the world even warner bros choice to call it a minecraft movie as opposed to the minecraft movie implies a spectrum of different concepts despite the reality of a business that can only imagine this one but black whatever his charms and regardless of how well theyre deployed here is a living testament to the idea that people can still thrive by staying true to their own expression if not in this world then perhaps in one of their own design ign jesse hassenger for a bigstudio adaptation of a massively popular videogame a minecraft movie lets a surprising amount of its directors personality shine through napoleon dynamites jared hess manages to fit some laughoutloud silliness into his overworld saga before surrendering to the obligations of cgdriven fantasy adventure thematically a minecraft movie offers a pat worldiswhatyoumakeit lesson but jack black and jason momoa in particular sell it with a lot of comic enthusiasm av club jacob oller one could rightfully question pretty much all of a minecraft movie a formulaic template ornamented with surrealism some moments bear the scribbled signature of a filmmaker with offbeat passions these are quickly plastered over by the hotel artwork of a fourquadrant ip extravaganzaand even the bythenumbers sequences seem jumbled out of order or repeated yet theres something fitting about this films contradictions minecraft is fertile ground for innovation and exploitation its adaptable limited mostly by those playing it one can build something personal copy something mass produced or attempt to tweak one with the other those behind a minecraft movie saw infinite possibilities laid out before them andunlike another adaptation of a popular building pastime the lego movieopted for the one thats been made a thousand times before new york post johnny oleksinski your noggin will certainly be done in by steve and garrett momoa flying through the air in a risque position suggesting a sex act really a minecraft movie a minute lobotomy put that on the poster for the uninitiated the overworld im pretty sure is a pixelated place where a player can erect buildings create tools and design weapons out of blocks the rules are unclear as the filmmakers picked silliness over storytelling stacking cubes would not at first glance seem like a strong plot to hang an actionadventure film on however the lego movie did so with cleverness heart and humor trust me the lego movie is lawrence of arabia next to minecraft next best picture giovanni lago theres a world where a minecraft movie actually backs the idealism of creativity which it so proudly boasts in its barebones story maybe if the film were animated it couldve played far better to the concept of endless possibilities and allowed for a far more visually dazzling spectacle inherently maybe it would never even be possible as the idea of creativity can only be celebrated as little as possible when its given the parameters of being in such a lazy ip scrape of the barrel as this there used to be a time when a majority of childrens films were made with such care and intention now it seems all you need is buzzwords celebrities and avengers endgame clapinducing moments all of which a minecraft movie has unlike a soul which at least the game feels like it possesses the daily beast nick schager so sloppy is a minecraft movie that it cant keep track of its various concerns highlighted by a mirthless subplotin which jennifer coolidges vice principal picks up and woos an overworld resident whos traveled to our universethat it basically drops around the midway point buried deep within hess wannabe blockbuster is a message about how creativity is cool and thus so too are outcasts yet nothing about this hodgepodge fits together minecraft enthusiasts will be pleased by the films various nods to its multiplatform predecessor nonetheless shouting out isnt the same thing as faithfully celebrating and translating and those with no experience assembling towers villages and weapons in mojang studios sandbox will undoubtedly find it all scattershot and wearisome its proof that you can build it but that doesnt mean anyonemuch less newbieswill come,,,,,

the best debut for cooglers career outside the black panther films in fact its the biggest debut for a liveaction original film in the postcovid climate opening above nope million simply put its a fantastic start take into account getting an original film to open this high is a miracle given that audiences are pivoting to focusing on franchises its a testament to the strength of ryan coogler and michael b jordan so how they did succeed where other original films failed for the past decade coogler has earned some great good will thanks to his works in films like creed and black panther the films have earned fantastic reception allowing him to finally get an original title like sinners to get greenlit it wasnt easy obviously a big reason why some studios turned it down was cooglers request to have the film rights revert to him after years so warner bros took the bullet and agreed to his terms a decision that apparently scared a lot of hollywood executives the films clear selling point was coogler and jordan but the premise was also very important a s horror film with jordan playing twins has been very weak for horror the biggest horror film is the monkey which hasnt even topped million worldwide the audience was starving for a horror film and sinners arrived at the right time to offer just that the films fantastic reviews cannot be ignored either its sitting at a marvelous on rotten tomatoes and on metacritic that makes it one of the best films of the year so even nonhorror fans wanted to see if the film would live up to the hype according to warner bros the biggest demos were black caucasians hispanic and latino and asian they gave it an incredible a on cinemascore this makes it one of the few horror films to get an a on the site poltergeist and aliens are the other two in its yearold history yes its insanely hard for a horror film to get this grade what does this mean that the film is gonna have some damn great legs its already seen in the weekend horror films can drop over on sunday yet sinners dropped just with no horror competition till final destination bloodlines sinners can have a lot of space for now were predicting a million domestic total for the film which is simply fantastic all around a minecraft movie dropped this weekend grossing million thats not a bad drop but its still rough just like last weeks the film is not collapsing but its not showing great legs either the film has amassed million so far and it should still hit over million domestically unsurprisingly the king of kings benefitted from the easter weekend it dipped just earning million this weekend thats one of the best holds for a film playing at over theaters through days the film has earned million although with the holiday over maybe it will have a steep drop next weekend th century studios the amateur was hit by the arrival of sinners it dropped a rough earning million this weekend while the film was aiming an old audience that doesnt go to opening weekend it looks like the film is struggling to leg out through days the film has earned a weak million and it remains a question mark if it will hit million domestically in fifth place as warfare dipped adding million this weekend through days the film has earned million and it will probably end its run with around million domestically universalblumhouses drop added million this weekend which is a poor drop after its already low start despite positive reviews and word of mouth the audience doesnt appear to be interested in the film through days it has earned just million and its now guaranteed to miss million domestically making it one of blumhouses lowest grossing titles colorful stage the movie a miku who cant sing managed to sneak into the seventh spot despite playing in just theaters earning million this weekend focus features rerelease of pride prejudice earned million in theaters that takes its lifetime total to million the chosen last supper part collapsed this weekend earning just million this weekend through all installments the show has made million so far rounding up the top was disneys snow white which is nearing the end of its run it had another brutal drop earning just million this weekend the films domestic total stands at a poor million so far bleecker street released the wedding banquet in theaters although the film earned just that means that the film is gonna make less than what ang lees original made back in million but the real worst performer of the week was briarcliffs animated film sneaks despite playing in theaters the film earned an abysmal this weekend thats one of the worst debuts for a film playing in over theaters expect this to fade quickly ahead of its wide release this week as the legend of ochi debuted in theaters earning thats a pertheater average which is quite low usually buzzy titles like this make k or more lets just hope it can do better when it hits wide release janus films also released david cronenbergs the shrouds in theaters where the film earned alos a low pertheater average it will continue expanding in the coming weeks overseas a minecraft movie earned million overseas taking its worldwide total to million the best markets are the uk m germany m australia m mexico m and china m the billion mark is becoming more and more likely pals sinners earned million in markets taking its worldwide numbers to million the best debuts were in the uk m france m mexico m germany k and australia k an okay start but its pretty clear its gonna lean heavily on the domestic side the amateur added a further million this weekend for a million worldwide total the best markets are the uk m france m mexico m japan m and spain m at the very least it should hit million worldwide thatd be great if it didnt cost million films that ended their run this week movie release date studio domestic opening domestic total worldwide total budget dog man jan universal m dreamworks dog man has ended its run with million domestically and million worldwide definitely a success given it cost just million but something weird about the film are its legs normally animated films leg out to a x multiplier but dog man finished with just a x multiplier making it one of the most frontloaded animated films while the super bowl impacted its second weekend not hitting the million milestone after its debut is kinda disappointing but then again this should be enough if dreamworks wants a new franchise this weekend weve got three wide releases though its unlikely any of them can take the top spot the closest that could challenge the top spot is amazon mgms the accountant which brings back ben affleck jon bernthal cynthia addairobinson and j k simmons in their roles the original film earned million worldwide and has been a huge success in streaming and home media so a sequel was pretty much imminent although the year gap raises concerns that they might have waited too long another release is sonys until dawn an adaptation of the video game director david f sandberg has had success in the horror field and in fairness the movie tries to change things up from the game nevertheless the films premise a time loop involving different killers suggests it pretty much abandoned the games original plot it remains to be seen if the fans will be willing to buy a ticket and as mentioned as the legend of ochi is hitting wide release the limited release numbers were quite underwhelming but perhaps it could surprise when it hits wide release

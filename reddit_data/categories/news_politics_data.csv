kwqdsf,Megathread: House Votes to Impeach President Donald J. Trump for Incitement of Insurrection,"The U.S. House of Representatives voted today to impeach President Donald J. Trump for Incitement of Insurrection. The vote saw 10 Republican members of Congress vote in favor of impeachment, along with all 222 Democrats. 

This is the first time that a US President has been impeached twice during their presidency. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has stated that he does not plan on reconvening the Senate prior to January 19th, making it likely that the impeachment trial will take place during the beginning of President-elect Joseph R. Biden’s administration.

kteyie,Megathread: Twitter Permanently Suspends @realDonaldTrump,"Twitter has announced a permanent suspension of President Donald Trump’s account, citing ""the risk of further incitement of violence"" after conducting a review of recent activity.

Twitter issued a temporary suspension earlier this week following the events taking place at the US Capitol and required the removal of three specific tweets before the account would be eligible for reinstatement. Prior to this, President Trump used Twitter to announce policy positions and campaign decisions.

See the announcement from Twitter’s Safety Team [here](https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1347684877634838528?s=20).

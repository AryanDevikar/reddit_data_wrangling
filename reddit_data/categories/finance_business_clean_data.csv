l6omry,wallstreetbets,2021-01-28 05:06:14,an open letter to melvin capital cnbc boomers and wsb mods do not delete this is important to me please read xb i was in my early teens during the crisis i vividly remember the enormous repercussions that the reckless actions by those on wall street had in my personal life and the lives of those close to me i was fortunate my parents were prudent and a little paranoid and they had some food storage saved up when that crisis hit our family we were able to keep our little house but we lived off of pancake mix and powdered milk and beans and rice for a year ever since then my parents have kept a food storage and they keep it updated and fresh those close to me my friends and extended family were not nearly as fortunate my aunt moved in with us and paid what little rent she could to my family while she tried to find any sort of work do you know what tomato soup made out of school cafeteria ketchup packets taste like my friends got to find out almost a year after the crisis low my dad had stabilized our income stream and to help out others he was hiring my friends dads for odd house work one of them built a new closet in our guest room another one did some landscaping in our backyard i will forever be so proud of my parents because in a time of need even when i have no doubt money was still tight they had the mindfulness and compassion to help out those who absolutely needed it to melvin capital you stand for everything that i hated during that time youre a firm who makes money off of exploiting a company and manipulating markets and media to your advantage your continued existence is a sharp reminder that the ones in charge of so much hardship during the crisis were not punished and your blatant disregard for the law made obvious months ago through your for the melvin lawyers out there alleged illegal naked short selling and more recently your obscene market manipulation after hours shows that you havent learned a single thing since and why would you your ilk were bailed out and rewarded for terrible and illegal financial decisions that negatively changed the lives of millions i bought shares a few days ago i dumped my savings into gme paid my rent for this month with my credit card and dumped my rent money into more gme which for the people here at wsb i would not recommend and im holding this is personal for me and millions of others you can drop the price of gme after hours im not going anywhere you can pay for thousands of reddit bots im holding you can get every mainstream media outlet to demonize us i dont care im making this as painful as i can for you to cnbc you must realize your short term gains through promoting institutions agenda is just that short term your staple audience will soon become too old to care and the millions of us not just at wsb but every person affected by the crash thats now paying attention to gme are going to remember how you stuck up for the firms that ruined so many of us and tried to tear down the little guys i know for sure ill remember this in response here is a list of cnbc sponsors and partners they include but are not limited to ibm cisco tmobile jpmorgan oracle and ziprecruiter their parent company is nbcuniversal owned by comcast and ge to the boomers andor people close to that age just now paying attention to these millennial blog posts you realize that even if you werent adversely effected by the crash your children and perhaps grandchildren most likely were were not enemies were on the same side stop listening to the media thats making us out to be market destroyers and start rooting for us because we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to punish the sort of people who caused so much pain and stress a decade ago and were taking that opportunity your children your grandchildren might have suffered as i described because of the institutions that were fighting against you really want to choose them over your own family and friends were not asking you to risk your k or retirement fund on a single gme bet were just asking you to be understanding supportive and to not support the people that caused so much suffering a decade ago to wsb you all are amazing i imagine that im not the only one that this is personal for ive read myself so many posts on what you guys went through during the crash whether youre here for the gains to stick it to the man as i am or just to be part of a potentially market changing movement thank you each and every one of you are the reason that we have this chance ive never felt this optimistic about the future before this is life changing amounts of money for so many of you and to be part of a rare instance of a wealth distribution from the rich to the poor is just incredible i love you all xb xb note i cant seem to get a hold of mods and they keep fucking removing the post i have no idea how to get this to stick and its important to me that the people im addressing read it

l6j4r9,wallstreetbets,2021-01-28 00:36:02,where do we go from here and who is going to step up to help us we have grown to the kind of size we only dreamed of in the time it takes to get a bad nights sleep weve got so many comments and submissions that we cant possibly even read them all let alone act on them as moderators we wrote software to do most of the moderation for us but that software isnt allowed to read the reddit new feed fast enough and submit responses and the admins havent given us special access despite asking for it were suffering from success and our discord was the first casualty you know as well as i do that if you gather k people in one spot someone is going to say something that makes you look bad that room was golden and the people that run it are awesome we blocked all bad words with a bot which should be enough but apparently if someone can say a bad word with weird unicode icelandic characters and someone can screenshot it you dont get to hang out with your friends anymore discord did us dirty and i am not impressed with them destroying our community instead of stepping in with the wrench we may have needed to fix things especially after we got over server boosts that is pretty unethical to add to this people are coopting our name on twitter i wont mention their accounts but lots of handles with wsb and wallstreetbets in them are pretending to speak for us theyre saying things that we dont agree with driving traffic to derivative communities and shitty pixelated merch stores and generally making it harder for us to define who we are theres also too much political bullshit in a community that was never ever political the only way i want to occupy wall st is in a suit myself or rentfree in the mind of a blown up short that is why im throwing my support behind the twitter handle in general we need a way to publicly reach out to the staff of the infrastructure that is failing us so the world can see that we arent doing anything wrong here if they dont respond we need to be able to respond directly to a reporter that is lying to the world about our clubhouse we cant be expected to meet any expectations when we arent given the tools we need thats not to say i approve of every message or will even be in the loop for all of them but its clear to me we cant do nothing and we need a megaphone well do our best not to pretend to speak for you but to try to speak with the volume our name now seems to command to get shit done for us edit as of recent developments the aforementioned twitter handle is obviously not legit anymore phew

lalucf,wallstreetbets,2021-02-02 03:03:05,i suspect the hedgies are illegally covering their short positions tldr melvin and gang hasnt covered shit theyve been illegally closing out their short positions and if we hold they will get fucked there is far more nefarious shit at play so this morning i saw the s and ortex data both report significant covering of short positions for gme this absolutely threw me for a loop because friday morning they reported above short interest still i could not for the life of me figure out how someone could close of short positions on such a tightly held stock in one day with very little trading volume in the week this got me digging around to figure out whats up i started by looking into gme failed to delivers ie short sellers not able to cover their position on a stock for the first half of january and i was shocked to find that just in the first days of jan gme had million failed to delivers this is before most of wsb or mainstream began buying what was interesting though is that of that million k shares were covered in chunks throughout the two week period i dug further back into the sec failed to deliver reports for gme and saw that pattern extending back months it seemed almost as if the short positions were just being kicked down the road having spent some time looking at the pattern its clear a large amount of failed to delivers come in then a small chunk of coverage then another large amount and so on to me this looked shady af so i looking into reasons that could cause that and discovered this article in it a specific section is eerily similar to what weve experienced with gme assuming that xyz eg gme is a hard to borrow security eg apes holding strong and that trader a melvin or its brokerdealer is unable apes again to borrow shares to make delivery on the short sale of actual shares the short sale may result in a fail to deliver position at trader as clearing firm rather than paying the borrowing fee on the shares to make delivery or unwinding the position by purchasing the shares in the market trader a might next enter into a trade that gives the appearance of satisfying the brokerdealers closeout requirement but in reality allows trader a to maintain its short position without ever delivering on the short sale most often this is done through the use of a buywrite trade but may also be done as a married put and may incorporate the use of short term flex options these trades are commonly referred to as reset transactions in that they have the effect of resetting the time that the brokerdealer must purchase or borrow the stock to closeout a fail the transactions could be designed solely to give the appearance of delivering the shares when in reality the trader has no intention of meeting his delivery obligations such transactions were alleged by the commission to be sham transactions in recent enforcement cases such transactions between traders or any market participants have also been found to constitute a violation of a clearing firms responsibility to close out a failure to deliver its almost like a play by play of what weve seen in combination with the ladder attacks my guess is well find out more when the failed to deliver report for the second half of jan comes out on the th i think that melvin is committing massive securities fraud in fact i would bet all my money on it oh wait i did gme i am now holding on principle to see these fucks fail more dd not a financial adviser i eat paint chips for dinner edit ok so ive been reading some comments and i wanted to clear a couple things up the failed to deliver number is reported cumulatively so if you sum everything for the jan time period itd come out incorrectly as million what im doing is summing all the debits to get an aggregate view of all the failed to delivers in the time range this process is validated and discussed in other rwsb posts i know etfs could have been redeemed by some mms to gather up gme stock however im not convinced there is enough gme held in etfs to be a significant factor someone in the comments reported this amount to be about m we would know if a bunch of etfs rebalanced and dumped gme my number for the ortex short interest was incorrect i got mixed around when i wrote this initially the short interest reported by ortex on friday morning was the figure for s was correct please checkout the linked dd it goes into much more detail and covers things far better than i can share this post and the related dd we need to hold wall street accountable if this is true and i think that starts by spreading the word im going to continue to dig into this tonight tomorrow look forward to a new post tomorrow evening if i take an l to i take an l to i dont invest what i cant lose but you can bet your ass ill be holding till this blows open we like the stock

7nhrsp,personalfinance,2018-01-01 21:30:57,warning att applying customer loyalty speed upgrades without customer consent so over the holiday i received an email with an order confirmation from att my isp and the only one available in my area and it had a new bill amount about month higher i havent ordered anything so the first thing i thought was maybe someone got a hold of my account number or personal info and changed it i immediately logged in to check out my plan and make sure everything was in order i had a notification that showed that att had upgraded my internet speed at no extra charge obviously i was annoyed by this so i dug a little deeper to figure out why the bill had changed i then found this alert showing that the promotional discount for this socalled customer loyalty speed upgrade would expire in a month and my bill would go up more per month i then looked at my bill and found that they had upgraded my plan to the highest speed and most expensive plan they have without my consent under the guise of customer loyalty and applied a month promotional rate for month to make it look like my plan hadnt changed and the new bill was probably just some random fee added on like most isps occasionally do i immediately called and spoke to a rep named jorge who stated that it was a mistake that the change was applied automatically and it wasnt supposed to be applied to my account but after telling him if it was automatic it needed to be addressed immediately because it was probably affecting other people he confessed that att was aware of it and that they had received many calls about it i dont for one second believe this was accidental i believe they are doing it on purpose and hoping that many people wont notice make sure you watch your bills because if this happened to me it is almost certainly happening to others im not sure what should be done about it if anything and i dont personally care at this point because the issue is resolved for me but i do feel like att should be outed for this shady behavior and that someone should be held responsible so i wanted to post to show everyone what happened if this is the wrong place to post please suggest a better sub this was just the closest thing i could think of that applied and it could be sharedcrossposted from here edit since there were a couple questions about my last login the date is inaccurate i usually log in from my phone but did it via my computer this time so i could make the post easier w images etc not sure why its showing as my last login as im pretty sure i didnt even have att then lol anyway heres the email i received dated so this is definitely a current thing edit since this is getting a good amount of attention if this happens to you heres what i did you should immediately pause your autopay if you have it so the bill doesnt get paid note that i got this email two days before the bill was due on so they definitely tried to sneak it by me then call them and they should credit your current bill back to your normal rate you should pay that months bill manually then let autopay resume as others have noted in the comments always watch your bill closely edit fixed some formatting stuff edit holy moly this thread has picked up some steam thanks anonymous reddit friend for popping my golden cherry one last edit from a pm i receivedthe sender wanted to remain anonymous but i thought this was great info i work in big telcom what you experienced is called a slam sale in the industry its when a salesman places an order for you without ever receiving your approval for the order the salesman gets credit for the sale meets quota or receives a big bonus oddly enough this is not a very common tactic today it was popular until years ago and its almost unheard of today i wasnt aware that att was experiencing slam sales today you can protect your account from slam sales all the major telco providers will offer authenticationsecure account protection call att ask for billing and tell the rep that you want to passwordprotect your account from unauthorized sales you can setup either a password or a pin that must be entered to make any account changes sorry this happened to you and another pm i also work for a major telco as wellname is somewhat synonymous with dicks the account pinpassword is visible to us when we do verification and would not stop someone from putting sales on random accounts pretty much every isp and cable company uses outdated billing software from the s thats a glorified as mainframe running with a s era gui overlay scroll about halfway down in this pdf for some screenshots

boza0g,personalfinance,2019-05-15 15:24:14,i made a spreadsheet for people who dont know how to budget hey guys last year i made a spreadsheet to help myself budget im terrible at sticking to a budget so i made a sheet that breaks it down so that i just have the ability to break it down to a daily manageable amount heres what it looks like i grew up very poor and had no sense of what or even how to start budgeting i was taught that money would disappear if i didnt use it so i just used it even now i still feel anxiety about money and can spend recklessly if im not careful another problem i faced is that i have adhd so impulse control can be hard and it can also be hard to keep track of every purchase and focus on a bunch of aspects of a budget this spreadsheet is made so you only focus on one number xb the sheet was set up with three goals in mind xb that it be easy to use that it focuses on a daily budget that supports long term goals instead of a long term budget that doesnt have daily support that it be a good starting place for people who have never saved before xb so how does it work the main budget is divided into three core areas xb income you use this to fill in your income and choose to have a monthly weekly or biweekly pay cycle if you are a worker who is tipped it includes an area where you can add tips my suggestion is put in your minimum average income from tips so for example if you usually make from tips a week even if you get extra try to program your budget around the minimum average expenses there you can add your expenses utilities are bills that are for electricity heat phone internet or water bills are important expenses that you cant miss and are integral to living finally expenses are other things you need to allocate money for whether it be gas lunch expenses transportation ect within your expenses there are two areas to which you need to pay attentioncredit card payments this is new to this years sheet use the tab below to fill out your information for up to three credit cards decide whether to pay the minimum payment or choose an amount to pay the tab will allow you to see how much youre paying and how much interest youre accruing once you have filled it out your budget will adjust accordinglybig purchase use this tab to create a budget for a large purchase and adjust your budget easily and automatically to finance this purchase budget summary finally the most important part of this sheet is the budget summary here you will see just how much you can spend this money is shown in three ways the lump monthly sum a weekly amount or a daily amount as long as you dont go over that number you will have enough money for the rest of your budget it will also feature a breakdown of what your budget it where your money is going and what your income vs spending is xb here is a link to the sheet xb ou use it like this go in make a copy change the numbers decide what percentage of your income you want to be saved budget the sheet includes three charts a bar graph as a simple visual tool to see if you are spending more than you are saving a pie chart to see where your money is distributed a daily pie chart to see realistically where your money is going compared to your target savings i dont work well with a lot of budgets because i have issues imagining the big picture by giving myself a dailyweeklymonthly budget i can make sure that on any given day i havent spent more than im allowed to and if i do i can see where im borrowing from or where that money is supposed to come from xb note all images in the spreadsheet are from vecteezy edit new copy link

9az2w9,personalfinance,2018-08-28 13:49:52,irs will allow employers to match their employees student loan repayments the irs is setting up a framework for companies to match their employees student loan repayments in the same way companies match k contributions this will be cost neutral for the employer edit as in it would not be more or less expensive for the company than traditional matching edit the employers match would go into the employees k account according to the article employees with student loan debt accumulate less wealth in their retirement plans by age than their peers without student loan debt i think most of us with student debt have at one point or another felt behind thoughts this is definitely a cool idea and would be a great hiring incentiveperk edit due to the popularity of this post i wanted to remind everyone of some of the rules on our sub we dont allow moralizing issues petitions political discussions political baiting soapboxing this is meant to be a discussion of personal finance debt and retirement savings not a meta review of the pros and cons of capitalism please keep things on topic edit since a lot of people are confused ill explain how a k match works a k is a retirement savings plan that came into popularity as pensions fell out of the mainstream the k is a taxefficient vehicle to invest your money for retirement like the pension employers can contribite to their employees k plans as a benefit this is usually done via a matching mechanism i contribute of my paycheck and my employer matches that amount matches are almost always capped with the method laid out in the article you would be able to make qualified student loan payments and have your company match that amount as a contribution to your k up to a certain amount so say you make per month your employer matches of your k contributions and your monthly minimum loan payment is in this example you have a lot of debt you arent contributing to your k currently if your company chose to take advantage of this program they would put match in your k each month you made a payment on your student loan this doesnt hurt people without loans this is only subsidized by the government insofaras the k is taxsheltered you still pay taxes on that money and this doesnt constitute your company paying your loans participation isnt compulsory
dp7pww,personalfinance,2019-10-30 14:46:25,i mde a spreadsheet for people who dont know how to budget ver hey guys im back six months later with a new version of the budgeting spreadsheet i made earlier this year i posted the spreadsheet i made for myself and it really resonated with people as i got more and more feedback i found places where i could improve and develop the sheet into something easier to use but still useful you can find pictures of it here a bit of background on me and why i made this and also why its made the way it is i grew up poor and was never taught about how to handle money if we had money it was already needed for other things food bills all of the money we had already had a place this made me get a mentality that if i had money i needed to spend it before something came up and the money would go its unhealthy but it was the only thing i knew until i moved out i was taught that money would disappear if i didnt use it so i just used it even now i still feel anxiety about money and can spend recklessly if im not careful xb another problem i faced is that i have adhd so impulse control can be hard and it can also be hard to keep track of every purchase and focus on a bunch of aspects of a budget this spreadsheet is made so you only focus on one number xb i have made this sheet and previous versions of it with three goals in mind that it be easy to use that i can focus on one daily number while supporting my long term goals that it be a good starting place for people who have never had another budget the sheet is divided into a few different tools budget select your pay schedule add any extra incometips that you get monthly and select the percentage of that income that you want to save the credit card section allows you to input up to five cards and adds your monthly car payments to your expenses the expenses area is where youll add all of your itemized expenses you can also select when your bill is due during the month allowing you to see if early on in the month your spendable is different from later on in the month your budget summary at the top is the breakdown of all the information below yes i know pie charts arent useful for everything but that is useful to visually digest information look and see where your money is going see if you spend more than you earn and finally see how much money you can spend xb this sheet focuses on giving you one number to remember daily spendable if you want to spend money throughout the day you just have to make sure you dont go over that number and you will always have enough to cover any other expenses i dont work well with a lot of budgets because i have issues imagining the big picture by giving myself a dailyweeklymonthly budget i can make sure that on any given day i havent spent more than im allowed to and if i do i can see where im borrowing from or where that money is supposed to come from there are a few extra features too a large purchase calculator that lets you figure how long youd have to save to buy a larger purchase it includes a monthly tracker that lets you see what youre spending realistically vs what youve budgeted for and finally a daily tracker for further breakdown xb finally link three changes added a bi weekly option so you stop asking me to redo math please yall its an open spreadsheet you can edit it but i did this one for you also note yall i wont make an excel version some of the functionsgraphs break and the whole point of this is that i made it for myself and i want to share it freely what means not a paid program im sorry

bqwrrc,personalfinance,2019-05-20 15:11:19,to all the graduating high school seniors and those turning get a bank account thats only in your name for minors its generally required for a parent to cosign their bank accounts once you turn its best to establish an account in your name only so you have sole control of it it would even be better if you can establish the account at a different bankcredit union than the one the minor account was in to avoid any inadvertent connections between the previous and new account there are a couple reasons for this it doesnt take too long to find stories of people who are still using the accounts they had when they were minors who are shocked when their money is suddenly taken away for reasons beyond their control the parents could have financial problems and either use the money to pay off their debts or the money is seized by the institutions that they owe there could be disagreements between parents and their kids so they take the money away as a punishment or it could just be old fashioned greed and the parents decide to just take the money it doesnt matter who earned the money thats in the account if two people are on it the money belongs to both parties and the bank isnt going to stop someone on the account from withdrawing the cash keep in mind also having your own account does not mean that your parents cant send you money if you need it all they need is your account and routing number the same information that would be on a check to deposit money into the account in addition there are any number of banking apps today they could use to send money to you if youre still being supported by them other excuses may have good intentions at heart but from a safety and security standpoint its best to establish an independent banking account

9dcwnn,personalfinance,2018-09-06 00:38:51,your amazon store card is probably scamming you i noticed a weird charge in my statement that pays my amazon store credit card off its listed as security i didnt know what it was but the amount kept going up as my card balance went up called the number and the guy answered then danced around what the name of the company was and what they were charging me for eventually he slipped the word synchrony and that dinged in my head the bank that issues the amazon card so i googled all this while still trying to get this guy to tell me what this charge was for and found that its an automatic form of insurance that you are put on when you open the card its of your balance monthly and you have to opt out by responding to a single piece of paper mail that gets sent sometime when you open the card now im getting frustrated that this guy isnt saying what the hell his company does when he just changes gear and says the full balance will be returned and the service stopped it was over dollars since ill have it back in days i was told but check your statements people edit even if you use the for months on large purchases which is how i typically use my card it still charges their fee every month edit i had to go to amazons chat this morning as it was still showing as being active the representative was polite and disabled it immediately saying the refund will come in a weeks credited to my card edit i was credited back the money this morning hours after chatting with support

9n43xm,personalfinance,2018-10-10 22:14:55,a story of how i just got out of paying a bill why you should never blindly trust a debt collection agency and always request proof of a debt owed i got a call out of the blue a little over a month ago from a debt collection agency saying i owed almost from an ambulance ride i took because of me being involved in a car accident over years ago while on the phone with the debt collector i looked up debt collection laws and after a couple minutes of research decided to request a debt validation letter which they are legally required to send me within days of initial contact long story short never received it instead they sent me a verification of balance letter which immediately told me holy shit they dont have proof i owe the debt which means im not legally required to pay this shit today right before the day cutoff i receive another call from them attempting to collect the debt i request to speak with a supervisor after going back and forth with him for a few minutes about why they havent sent me a debt validation letter which theyre required to do under the law he transfers me to his supervisor this is where it gets fun im now going back and forth with him after a few minutes he puts me on hold roughly minutes later he comes back on and says sir after reviewing your file it doesnt appear we have the documentation required pertaining to the original bill in order to send you a debt validation letter however i am showing you have a balance owed here in your file of would you like to pay a portion of it now set up a payment plan or holy fuck this dumbass just admitted to me they dont have proof of me owing the debt which means im not legally required to pay it its null and void i tell him this he gets flustered and after some more back and forth basically tells me to have a nice day and hangs up the phone im going to still send a letter requesting a copy of the debt validation letter via certified mail with a return receipt requested to cover my ass and when they dont because they arent able to its a done deal if they try to put it on my credit report i just contact the credit agencies with proof of me asking for the debt validation letter and never receiving it and it gets removed from my credit report moral of the story always ask for documentation dont let debt collectors scaring you into paying a debt you may not be required to pay heres the bogus ass letter i received edit this seems to be a pretty common question so im editing it into the main body of my post im being asked if i actually even rode in an ambulance and if i did i should just pay it i was involved in an auto accident because some girl ran a red light and tboned me going mph and i had to take ambulance rides because of it i contacted my attorney and he sent me an itemized list of all debtors paid after the settlement which was finished years ago there was a couple ambulance companies listed on there but the amounts did not match the this debt collector was claiming and without an account number or any sort of identifying info i was unable to match it to either of the paid ambulance bills in the documentation i received from my attorney thus me attempting to clarify this with the debt collector via a debt validation letter
5uoe7r,personalfinance,2017-02-17 20:16:56,update found out i was being paid less than entry level employees what do i do hey guys a couple weeks ago i posted about a situation at work where i was promoted to an admin and clinical position and found out that i was being paid at least a dollar less than entry level employees i was making hr while others were making anywhere between hr i asked for advice and the post blew up to the point where i had to delete do to me being careless with personal info i received a lot of advice to search for another job negotiate higher than i was asking and some pms asking for my name and location and position in the company which led to me deleting the post anyway i met with the woman in charge of wages for my company and the talk was very friendly and transparent she said the person hiring people before me was ignoring protocol and absolutely should not have hired people at that rate she said our range was significantly lower for hiring and that was a mistake on the previous persons end since she showed me proof of emails that went on between everyone i listened and acknowledged and said i understand but where does that leave me originally they offered me a cent raise which would bring me to which i quickly countered and explained calmly why that wasnt a fair compensation i feel with my qualifications and my value of being the only fully certified employee at my location i think a cent raise would not be very fair to reflect my role after minutes she realized i had never received my mandatory day evaluation for a wage increase never received raises for certain goals met and other factors i received a raise to hr and i will be up for review again in april when my annual review comes up where she said with everything you have done the minimum you will see your wage go up is another i would expect to be up to at least hr when your eval is due most likely more i requested that in writing so id have it and she happily obliged tldr was being paid less than entry level employees negotiated professionally thanks to advice from the sub received a raise with another one coming in two months edit forgot to mention full back pay for the time worked also edited our irrelevant company info edit im going to acknowledge this because ive been seeing a lot of people saying its a low wage and i should leave ill admit its not an ideal wage however the overall career benefit towards a higher wage and career is well worth it they pay for graduate school in full which benefits me as it is a top university they are affiliated with for my career path they offer a lot of benefits most companies similar to mine do not offer or offer at a high cost to the employee im well aware i could be making more but something people on here forget sometimes is life satisfaction im happy where i am and yes the wage isnt perfect but i love what i do and i wake up every day excited to work not dread it i do look at it as a paycheck but i am not unhappy edit didnt realize this would generate hate well ill break down even more whether hr is screwing me with this new wage is honestly whatever you guys think in my opinion they took care of me as best they could this is a position that doesnt require a degree and hopefully when i receive mine this may it will go up more in pay the takeaway from the post was supposed to be that i was able to get a higher wage by being professional and collected those of you saying to leave a job im happy at for money it baffles me yes i was unhappy with my pay when i found out now thats fixed and im happy again its a shame i have to explain that to reddit but seriously being happy and making okay money is perfectly fine for me because this path and company will allow me to do both if i invest the time now its not about making a lot of money right away its about learning and perfecting your skills to make more money i just get lucky enough to have both

6ooc52,personalfinance,2017-07-21 14:43:26,seriously get and use a credit card ive encountered many people both in my personal life and online that insist upon using a debit card for their purchases instead of using a credit card either because they dont yet have one or because they have some fear of using a credit card there are literally no cons to using a credit card if and heres the catch youre responsible thats all there are so many pros built in to using a credit card over a debit card here are a few its safer when you use a debit card to make a purchase youre essentially handing the merchant direct access to your bank account should the waitress at the restaurant youre eating at write down your debit card number or should your favorite grocery store experience a breach thats direct access to your account and your money yeah you can file a fraud dispute with your bank and get your money back eventually but in the meantime that money is poof gone compare this to using a credit card when you do this youre using the creditors money to make your purchase and you dont have to pay it until your statement closes you have a day window in between payments to make sure that all purchases on your card are yours and if theres a purchase you didnt make thats not your money missing it builds your credit when you use a credit card responsibly it will build your credit over time which if youre young may not be a big deal to you but eventually you might want to buy a car or house and unless you have a lump sum sitting in cash youre going to need to finance it low interest loans are granted to people with good credit scores meaning you pay the bank less in interest to use their money compared to someone with poor credit who will either get a high interest loan or no loan at all the caveat here is that you never miss a payment ever a good rule of thumb is to only spend on credit what you can pay cash for at the same time you should never buy something on credit that you couldnt otherwise afford at that same point in time with your debit card purchase protection a lot of major credit card companies like american express and discover offer a suite of purchase protection features this is especially useful when you buy big ticket items like a flat screen tv or laptop for example because it adds a layer of protection to you the consumer some features are accidental damage coverage if you break your device in the first couple months of owning it you can get it replaced by your credit card company better price guarantee just bought an expensive item but found a better deal somewhere else the credit card company will cover the difference theft protection if your item is stolen within the first few months of owning it your credit card company will replace it for you extended warranty all my credit cards offer of the manufacturers original warranty on any purchase year manufacturers warranty on my iphone becomes a year warranty including the extra year of coverage from the credit card company and many more the credit card company will reward you for using it most credit cards offer points or cash back that you earn every time you swipe your card on things youd already be buying anyways same applies for paying bills so by using a credit card you can get a percentage of cash back or points that you can redeem later or put towards a purchase or vacationtrip some tips on using a credit card never miss a payment ever you will destroy your credit with as little as one missed payment only buy on a credit card what you can afford to buy on a debit card at the same point in time this is how people end up with s in credit card debt because they use their card irresponsibly and then cant afford the payments being responsible is the only thing it takes to use a credit card pay in full only suckers make the minimum payments when you only pay the minimum each month the credit card companies will charge you interest for using their money longer than the day statement period whatever you heard about making the minimum payment to boost your credit score is false paying your card off in full achieves the same score improvements hopefully this post is enough to convince you to make the move to responsible spending with a credit card theyre awesome financial tools to build your credit and build your future as a responsible adult and all it takes is responsibility and self control now heres a success story for you now that youve gotten through this post a couple months ago my credit card number was skimmed and used several states away from me the purchase was at a small convenience mart and was only a few dollars as the thief was likely testing the card to make sure it works my bank notified me immediately of the fraud alert all i had to do was say it wasnt me who made the charge and it disappeared never had to deal with it again granted a couple bucks didnt do any harm to me but had that been a purchase of or more that would have stung if it was my debit card that made the purchase i applied for my first credit card the day i turned i now have seven credit cards with over in available open credit across them and a credit score of at a young age all it took was a little persistence and responsibility if i can do it believe me so can you edit thanks for the gold

f5336f,personalfinance,2020-02-17 04:24:01,my experience with a timeshare wyndham sales team in vegas im writing this because the reddit threads on this topic are outdated and more people should know what i now know about the new timeshares this is what its like to be on the receiving end of a wyndham timeshare sales pitch here goes i vaguely knew what i was getting in to my girlfriend and i arrived at an mgm owned casino we get a bite to eat and as soon as we began our exploration of the casino someone approached us offering vouchers for free play in the casino worth im usually hesitant to ever get sucked into something like this but my girlfriend insisted that we do it they give it to you for showing up well just say no ive got friends who did this too etc i went along and decided to keep an open mind about it we talk to this guy who convinces people to attend this seminar for two hours and youll receive the vouchers plus a hotel room for a few nights from a selection of locations plus free breakfast he insists that all you need to do is say no not interested once the hours are up and you can just leave with your vouchers obviously his incentive isnt to sell anything but fill the buses with as many people as possible the next day we get on the bus to the seminar location my initial thought was that wed all crowd into a room and watch some presentation before given the opportunity to bounce i was caught off guard when every couple was assigned a salesperson we meet our salesman and he immediately compliments us is incredibly impressed by any of the words we string together and has now become our fake best friend we go into the presentation and the speaker does his thing and everyone here should be aware that much of what he said was true but his conclusions were abhorrent he pointed out that in america we do not use all of our vacation days we tend to waste them we are also constantly putting off that one trip to our dream destination to someday but someday never comes next he points out that most people dying people regret working so much and wish they spent more time with their families these are true facts but then he concluded by suggesting we should all buy into this program which will allow us to take these dream vacations it was the kind of sound financial advice youd expect from someone who would directly benefit from the purchase and would never hear from you again i want to note the speaker was talented and entertaining he was loaded with jokes selfdeprecating humor it was funny but holy shit looking around the room were the salespeople with the obnoxious fake laughter they saw this probably a hundred times it was creepy it was surreal of the audience was in on the sales pitch the salespeople used every joke as an opportunity to measure the responses on the faces on their paired couple the speaker would crack a joke and all the sales people would simultaneously throw their back out laughing before turning to the couple they were with to see if they were laughing too there were no opportunities for me to speak with my girlfriend without the salesman eavesdropping the presentation moved fast enough that looking anything up seemed like too much of a distraction as skilled as they seemed at controlling my behavior the whole thing was throwing up red flags anyway the presentation ended and our salesman led us to a table on the way over there were other couples sitting out in the open with their assigned salesperson they seemed excited about what they were hearing and excitedly signing papers it wasweird we sit down and the salesman goes through the program in more detail heres where i get genuinely turned off i work in it im about to finish my bachelors degree i dont think im a sucker but my love of science puts me at odds with a person whos giving me overwhelmingly biased information he reiterates all of the great things about this program he turns to my girlfriend what do you think about that it sounds great then he turns to me and what do you think about that is it something youd want to do and i reply depending on the cost yes id do it next he has us estimate the cost of a hotel we normally pay for then he asks us how many vacation days we take per year this is fine and easy math if the average cost is per night and you take days its per year in hotel costs the program timeshare but they completely avoid the term lasts years its still vague at this part but the salesman insists on focusing on how much we are gonna pay for these hotel rooms over the next years cost per year multiplied by years is but thats not the equation theyre doing theyre not accounting for interest ah it would be more over that time how much does it really cost about they estimate that the hospitality industry has an inflation rate of everyone should have it ingrained in their heads that inflation across the entire economy in america has been around per year he was willing to tinker with the numbers but generally speaking were spending a fuck ton of money on just hotels according to their calculations and any close observers would note that the number should have been much lower years i could have been wrong in my calculation but their cost estimate was obscenely high disclaimer as several people pointed out some of that math is off and i used the incorrect equation this does not change the conclusions here is a better description from a more qualified redditor umowscut as an actuary both yours and their calculators bothered me no idea where k comes from but your calculation assumes youre paying the fully inflated price in years for every payment the full value is a simple future value of annuity certain formula which is pin i where i is the interest n the number of payments and p the payment amount this gives which is also a crazy number but formulaically appropriate then he asks if we have any more questions uh yeah how much are we talking about here they never mentioned up to this point how much it costs but im skeptical and the questions im asking are things like how do you actually book a vacation what happens if i change my mind about it is it transferrable the salesman doesnt know the answers to these questions so a higher level salesman comes over hes very happy to meet us he loves the outfit im wearing he compliments various other features and with the limited amount of information ive provided seems completely ready to compete with the other salesman for the title of my new best friend he answers some of my questions but cant provide any documentation to back up his claims they still wont provide a price but they hand an ipad to my girlfriend to start filling out personal information i look over and as soon as i see theres a field for the social security number i damn near slap it out of her hands they were literally going to do a credit check to see how much the cost would be for us huge red flag for me first the inquiry shows up on your credit report while that may not be so bad i want to be informed on making a purchase and at least know a price range before taking that kind of step this throws the salesman off apparently no one stops at this part of the process the head sales guy says its fine and offers for us to check out a room which would be the type of room wed be staying in if we join this program i still dont know how much this program costs we go and the salesman leaves my girlfriend and i alone to explore at our own pace this is where i frantically looked for the reddit thread where personal finance gurus say get the fuck out of there they kidnap redditors like you and your clone becomes a salesman i found a few threads and they did warn against this but they were at least a year old and it didnt all seem timely i couldnt find costs online either so i thought to myself how much per month would i be willing to pay for something like this i concluded per month but i still had misgivings about making a big commitment on such short notice when i couldnt even read anything like a contract id rather go home and read independent reviews so i can be confident in my decision i couldnt get to that point once again we end up back at the table but this time the salesman has a laminated piece of paper with prices on it i immediately i see huge numbers and realize why they waited so long to show it they wanted approximately for the total program it would be down to get started and almost per month note when i did the math later the actual cost wed likely pay is around what they wanted for the program but wed be paying a fortune upfront and have a monthly payment we could only go to where wyndham had properties which was in america or australia or some islands but if we wanted to go to europe it would be through rci which cost about per week thats about the cost of an airbnb in some locations so if youre a smart traveller it may not be worth it at all would you rather pay this the head salesman circles the or this he circles the ooga not want pay big number when ooga pay small number instead i didnt want it dollars was as high as id go this is the part where they tried to pit my girlfriend against me in an amateurish attempt at manipulation first they go through the list of everything we ever told them about what we liked about the program before we ever heard a price they even sneak in a you should be willing to sacrifice something for it and gave a few examples like eating out less or having fewer cups of coffee from starbucks so im telling the salesman that this is way too expensive and once again the head sales guy shows up he says things like i thought you said you liked the program you said it was a are you saying its not a you said youd be willing to sacrifice for this he was getting irritated then he turned to my girlfriend and says it doesnt sound like hes as rich as he says he is at this point i was infuriated best friends dont say things like this to each other but i held my cool i looked him dead in the eye and firmly said im gonna pass but damn the manipulation didnt stop and they didnt give up they leave us alone to fill out a brief survey with a guy who definitely doesnt sell anything so this guy shows up introduces himself and asks us about why we didnt buy it i was truthful it was too expensive and i wasnt willing to spend all that for it i also felt pressured to make a big commitment on something that hours earlier i knew nothing about so then he offers to sell us a trial program its a fraction of the price and it only lasts two years it starts to be appealing but then it is also limited to certain locations i ask to see the contract and the guy says what do you want me to do sit here and read you a contract at that point he gets frustrated and offers to walk us to the exit it had been hours we get our vouchers and leave tldr it would have been a bad financial decision edit there are a ton of stories in this thread from people who have had experiences with timeshares they are all worth reading

as5zhr,personalfinance,2019-02-19 03:41:41,as a former car salesman these are the common fallacies that people used to justify purchasing a new car there are basic reasons people came in to purchase a car current car is messy i sold a ton of cars to people whos current car they hated simply because it was dirty some elbow grease or paying for a good detail could have saved them k wanted new technology i sold k cars weekly because of bluetooth capabilities no matter how old your car is you can add this to any existing car for around cheaper if your diy wanted it as a status symbol cars always look amazing at a dealership where they are waxed clean and smothered in armor all and tire shine in two weeks the difference between your old car and your new car will probably be negligible the whole status symbol thing really only lasts a few weeks most of your peers dont know the difference between a new and much older models if they are both dirty mechanical problems this is the only reason i would advise anyone to purchase a car eventually the repairs get to the point where its more expensive to keep it than to move on if you are buying a car for anyother reason than this dont edit reading the comments i figured i should address some general thoughts safety isnt something i meantioned before but probably should have regardless of how reliable a car is if you are driving something with a rusted frame and year old safety features its time to upgrade assuming you can afford it my wife and kids drive in a star crash rating car with every modern safety feature we have chose to be stingy in other places in our finances so we can afford to have a car with these types of features its worth a little bit of money to us to know our family is safe and to be able to see when backing out of the driveway that moment when repairs out way the cost of upgrading is tricky i have been burned several times by spending money on repairs that i thought were a good investment only to have more and more repairs pile up i wish i knew some perfect rule for this i dont i have repaired cars i shouldnt have and i have gotten rid of cars that probably would have been great with minor investments

7bv4wo,personalfinance,2017-11-09 18:14:55,macys new employees are encouraged to open a store credit card apr to obtain their employee discount i recently picked up a parttime seasonal position at macys for some extra holiday cash ive been working in retail off and on over the past years and am familiar with the hiring and management practices at a lot of places but its been a few years since ive worked for a big retailer like macys i was very surprised and disappointed to learn that the employee discount is only available through a prepaid card like a gift card i guess not terrible but not great or through their actual store credit card they conveniently inform you of this halfway through your new hire paperwork and even allow you to apply right then and there ive been through this type of application process before but ive never seen something so brazenly unethical these are often young adults or older people applying for these positions filling out so many forms with so much corporate legalese that your head would spin and theyre being targeted with a hard hit thanks auto mod hit to their credit for a card with a ridiculous interest rate is this new in retail seems like a disturbing trend if it is anyone have any thoughts on this just wanted to get the word out edit thanks for the replies everyone really enjoyed the discussion about credit cards business practices and obviously pf the consensus seems to be that store credit cards are not any worse than other forms of lending as long as they are managed responsibly i respectfully disagree in that it seems like they are often offered to a range of people namely new employees that may not have the knowledge or experience to handle a line of credit but i will agree that its fair game to solicit employees i just think its kind of shady to imply that a store credit card is an easy solution for employees employees should just get an effing discount period but were all free to work and shop where we please so feel free to support smallerlocal businesses that dont subject their customers and employees to frivolous lending situations

5lgh97,personalfinance,2017-01-01 18:52:20,i raised my credit score by points in months and got myself out of debt thank to this subreddit i know i still have work to do but i wanted to share my small success story and some gratitude to this sub for helping me get my finances back on track in late i was out of work for several months due to an illness and just a few weeks after i returned to work my husband was laid off i had a small emergency fund but medical bills and keeping the rent paid on time meant that i was left with some sizable amounts of debt some of which went to collections i ignored my credit through and since i honestly didnt know how to fix it then i found this subreddit i read every post that seemed at all relevant to my situation and read all of the amazing information provided here towards the end of i finally decided that i was ready to fix my situation and get back on track in october i signed up for credit karma my credit score was a dismal i thought it was insurmountable but i took it one step at a time i treated it like a game every sunday i would log on to ck as well as several other score providers to see how many points i earned that week to start i found a few old collections accounts that were either inaccurate or were being reported past my states statute of limitations and disputed them to my surprise the very next week every single one of them had been removed from my report there is still one small collection account on my report one that wasnt disputed because i legitimately owe it which i plan on tackling next i now make a good salary but frequently found myself low on funds at the end of the month due to poor budgeting i signed up for mint and monitored all of my spending to see where my money was going i cut cable stopped eating out so much and cut some other unnecessary expenses coupled with taking on some extra side work on evenings and weekends when i could i was able to put over a month into savings when previously i struggled to save even of that next i tackled my credit card debt i started with about in credit card debt which isnt very much but my utilization was near every extra dollar i had went to those two cards until they were paid off i paid off the lowest balance first since the interest rates were the same for both cards seeing that first balance reported to my credit report was really nice once my utilization was under i called capitalone and requested a credit line increase which they provided taking my utilization down to i continued paying down my debt aggressively and now have utilization across both cards it took about weeks to pay these off due to my new aggressive budgeting strategy finally i called my credit union car loan and asked them if they would be willing to remove any of the late payments that were reported during my unemployment because it cant hurt to ask to my surprise they listened to me saw that my payments had been current since i started working again and removed late payments from my report as a good will adjustment i still have late payments reported but is better than today when i logged in to credit karma my score was all of my credit card debt is paid off my car loan will be paid off in months and i was able to replenish my emergency fund and start saving towards a down payment for a house seriously cannot thank this sub enough ive never posted here before but i must have read every single post here over the past months and just wanted you to know that im grateful to those of you who take the time to answer questions and help people get their lives back on track happy new year a small edit since this post got a little more attention than i anticipated wow thanks everyone first i have gotten some pms and comments assuming that this post was some sort of ad for ck and i assure you it isnt lol credit karma was one of several score services i utilized and i initially signed up since i saw it mentioned so frequently on this sub i mentioned it by name simply because it was the service i used continue to use most frequently ive also received some messages from people who for some reason dont believe that my post is true and that was certainly unexpected if the mods are amenable i would be happy to post screenshots with personal information redacted the purpose of this post was to remind everyone that a series of seemingly small steps forward can make a bigger difference in a smaller amount of time than you might expect i also appreciate the advice to check my real fico score i did that this morning and to my delight it was actually so a couple points higher than my ck score im very humbled to hear that my story was inspirational to some of you and wish everyone great success in the new year
c67628,personalfinance,2019-06-27 15:51:10,what i wish people told me before i got in cc debt quick background i got my first credit card by accident i thought i was filling out a loyalty card at cabelas ended up being a line of credit i was short years later and married with a baby girl i find myself with in credit card debt i actually saved my very last dollar and have it taped to my steering column in my truck and when i say last dollar i truly mean it we had negative balance in the bank and overtaxed all our cards less than two years later we now have in savings and no credit card debt we finance one of our cars credit card debt is crippling my dad calls it the ultimate slavemaster it forces you into depression almost by default and controls every aspect of your life heres my list and i hope it helps you im no guru i just learned the hard way you will not pay it off later when later comes youll be buying other things to pay off later read dave ramseys money makeover its got good tips and the tactics work the jones can suck it theyre miserable and controlled by debt also dont buy things you dont need to compete with people you dont care for anyways pick up a side hustle i taught myself to make skateboards and would handmake a week to sell to help pay off the debt my wife picked up birth photography talk to your boss ask what you can do to take a bigger paycheck home be a bitch about your budget set it and dont stray from it put postit notes with written on them at the office in your car on your mirror on your phone background seeing that everywhere actually reminded me of my goal of achieving cc debt not sure if it legit made a difference but i think it mightve become emotionless toward money i would get so pissed that i was dumping hundreds of my paycheck into debt payoff it was only till i stopped giving a f that it became easier to make bigger payments save nothing until its paid off it doesnt make sense to save money when you have cc debt growing exponentially in the opposite direction when in doubt overpay if you run short on money in your checking but whoop dip into the cc for bucks keep basically nothing in your bank account because you spend what you have my family could live off of a week but if we have to live off of guess what we would use so i would always put as much as made sense a few times i overpaid but it forced us to be frugal unsave your cards on amazon so if you go to buy something you have to go through the hassle of finding the card and filling in the fields these are just some of the silly things i picked up along the way that i think wouldve helped me stay out of the mess we are so happy now that we worked our butts off to become financially stable i hope this helped edit so many awesome comments i understand these are basic tips and not hardcore financial advice so please leave your advice even if you disagree with my tactics because theres a lot of comment lurkers who are scanning for more advice so keep all the comments coming
6ka7ku,personalfinance,2017-06-29 18:15:51,how my wife and i never fight over money you get married and then its living happily ever after right well a few months after we were married my wife came home from target with a couple of large shopping bags what did you buy this time no i didnt say that out loud im not that stupid but the thought did run through my mind and it concerned me why was i so upset over a trip to target i love allison i trust her and i know shes responsible she didnt come home with a new car she didnt gamble away all our savings so whats the big deal then it hit me i couldnt answer the question are we okay we were married and happy except when it came to money every day my wife used her money from her bank accounts and i was using my money with my credit cards i realized that we were still paying the bills and shopping like we were roommates rather than like a team or a family and as i thought more about it i discovered that how we used money was only part of the problem at the time i had just started a career as a financial advisor and i was being paid with a combination of a fixed salary and commission the amount i was making was changing every month edit i left the financial advising career about years ago wasnt for me allison had a stable job but her hourly rate was low plus her job was centered around tourism so the number of hours she worked went up in the summer and dropped in the winter at any given moment we had no idea if we were spending ourselves into a hole or climbing out of it we could compare how much we were charging on our credit cards and how much money was in our bank accounts but that got complicated we had accounts at different banks answering the question are we okay took a shitton longer than it needed to allison and i werent working or planning together when it came to money and i wanted to make a change all i wanted was to answer the question are we okay without getting a degree in accounting we learned how to handle money as separate people before getting married allison and i really were separate people we both had savings accounts checking accounts and credit cards to manage we learned how to pay bills in our own apartments with our own roommates who were also our groomsmen and brides maids allison and i ended up moving in together for the summer right before we got married so we werefrom a legal standpointroommates rather than a family we got used to paying the bills and shopping as separate people looking back combining our lives and becoming a family needed to happen we realize now that this moment was inevitable but no one ever taught us how we were responsible as individuals but not as a couple i figured that if we didnt start working together with our money the target incident would just get worse if i needed a new suit for work could we actually afford it what happens when we want to go on vacation would allison start to resent me for spending a lot of money on craft beer would i start resenting allison for buying another purse what if we go further and further into debt without knowing it what if we want to buy a house i love my wife and i trust her but the way we were going i didnt trust us no one ever taught us how to handle money as a team no one ever taught me how to handle money as a spouse fortunately i have great parents that i got to watch and i learned what a great marriage could be but they never talked about money around me in high school and college i learned how to balance my checkbook use a credit card and pay my bills but its easy to make decisions when i dont need anyone elses opinion or permission allison and i needed to do something different and it was up to us to change we needed to find some help i was on edge to begin with trying to network gain clients and work long hours already had me stressed out worrying about my clients money didnt leave much energy at the end of the day to take care of our money any time we needed to go shopping was stressful hanging out with friends made me feel guilty we live in florida so of course we like to go to orlando sea worlddisneyputtputt golfing i wanted to worry a lot less about money have some fun and not ruin our marriage in the process it was time to find some help what were the problems we needed to solve allison and i already worked well as a team we were both responsible but we had separate financial lives that needed to be combined somehow i realized that the three basic problems we needed to solve were how do we see all of our money in one place so we dont miss anything how can we manage daytoday decisions without nagging each other how do we financially and emotionally support each other in our goals and dreams this took some time to figure out step see everything in one place the first thing we did was to get everything into one place i had been using the app mint for years to help track my own stuff so we decided to start a new account edit i took out the link for mint to help out with the thumbnail issue im guessing you can find the app just fine without it edit i am not an employee of mint nor am i being paid by them im just a fan and the app has worked well for me the comments on this post also strongly suggest but are not limited to ynab good budget personal capital everydollar mvelopes and quicken you could also use excel google sheets apple numbers or any other spreadsheet software you are comfortable with to budget and keep track of your finances every savings account every checking account all the credit cards student loans car loans every transaction updated automatically all in one spot the clouds parted and the angels sang we both had access to see everything at any moment on a computer or our phones step give each other permission to spend money the next step was to start budgeting together and i had to talk allison into this she had some valid concerns and it all started with toothpaste since im a detailoriented person i was gungho about budgeting and tracking our money i love it when everything works together perfectly whereas allison has more of a good enough personality she was happy as long as we were staying out of trouble so when i started to talk about budgeting one of allisons first questions was if we spend our budget for toiletries and we need toothpaste i cant go out and buy more toothpaste it was a good question and i didnt have the answer right away over time weve learned how to budget each month without making the budget set in stone its flexible and when we need to change itwe change it toothpaste for days allison also asked and what if we want to go shopping on our own do we need to give each other permission the solution here was to budget fun money for each other every month allison gets some money that she gets to do whatever she wants with and every month i get some money that i get to do whatever i want with sometimes we overspend our fun money amounts okay honestlyits usually me but we make it work out edit we also have an entertainment fund in our budget every month which is for anything we do together you could call it date night money too after making a lot of mistakes hitting road bumps finding solutions and practicing our monthly budgeting hasnt caused any fights or headachesfor years step decide what we want together when it came to our goals and dreams we tried a formal system of tracking what we wanted but it didnt really work out it was too much for us as a couple our bigger goals like an emergency fund retirement and debt took some time but those goals take months or years or decades to accomplish once we set the plan there was no need for a conversation every month for the shorterterm ideas we developed a habit of asking each other what do you want this month sometimes i want new running shoes sometimes allison wants to throw a party at our house for friends and sometimes we both want a new dining room table in the end we just wait until an idea pops into our mind is it time to go back to disney world and we decide if we can afford it now or we need to save up and then put it in the budget its flexible and it works for us i calmed downfast after all our financial information was in one spot i immediately calmed down i had one number that showed me how much combined money we had in the bank and one number of how much we had charged on the credit cards one number minus the other gave me my answer we were okay after we started to budget seeing a target bag or any other shopping bag hasnt bothered me since we never fight about money allison and i have had a lot of fun with friends visited family and had wonderful vacations but we have made a lot of mistakes and have had to deal with a bunch of emergencies we talk discuss and decide but we dont fight if you want to ask a question or have me dive deeper into anything let me know in the comments ill respond as soon as possible edit wow everyone thank you for the wonderful stories comments and questions i had no idea this was going to make such an impact its cst and ive have got to do the other work i was supposed to do today i will respond and comment as much as i can tomorrow and through the weekend so keep going

6wkiv6,personalfinance,2017-08-28 16:31:22,how to determine if you can really afford that car i keep seeing posts where people are struggling with their budget but have some ridiculous car payment lets have a little discussion for people who are looking to buy a car heres some advice ill give your mileage may vary oh yes i went there this advice is in usd but works anywhere dont get stuck holding the bag on a car that depreciates faster than you pay it off ive done the math at a bunch of different interest rates and the bottom line is that months is the magic number for loan terms at years or below youre typically safe maybe you can push the boundary at super low interest rates but there are other reasons not to finance for too long including risk of financing a used vehicle for longer than expected reliable service life next write out your full budget and see what you have room for heres where young folks get trapped maybe if youre still in school or fresh out of school and have super low living expenses it will appear like you have tons of room for a fancy car as soon as you become fully independent with a real place to live and food needs and all that jazz which will very likely happen within a few years that magic car budget will vanish before your eyes be realistic account for all the standard living expenses fun budget savings and then be honest what do you really have to spend on transportation each month for a lot of people itll probably be a few hundred bucks then subtract what insurance and gas and other associated fees will cost you and multiply what youre left with by thats what you can afford to finance including interest does the number come out well under or equivalent low amount for whatever country youre from for many people it probably does dont be discouraged for you can get a great reliable car under ten grand does the number come out to less than very common save up and buy a car in cash i feel like people tend to look at k as cheap for a car but its not cheap at all include taxes and fees finance over years at and youre looking at well over mo then tack on insurance easily for a young driver and then tack on gas that k car costs you per month if you arent bringing home k each month that probably doesnt fit in your budget the reality is even a k car is not realistically affordable for the majority of income earners what about k cars radio commercials make them sound so affordable but cars in the kk range should be seen as luxury vehicles were talking six figure income required yet so many people buy k suvs and get screwed by the monthly payments please dont let it happen to you i work in a respectable profession and make a fairly decent wage people always ask me why i drive a year old car its because thats what i can realistically afford society in general has inflated expectations on what they can afford its time to fix this and save people from ruining their budgets edit thank you to the user who gave me gold i appreciate it

a0vol1,personalfinance,2018-11-27 15:10:17,att ran my credit not only without my permission but after i explicitly stated i did not want a hard hit i called in to ask what internet speeds were available in my area he tried to sell me on cable which i declined he asked for my social and my date of birth i asked him why he needed this and he explained it was to make sure i didnt have any past due balances with att i then double checked and asked him if it would hit my credit and he chuckled and said no no sir nothing like that fast forward an hour i have an email stating my installation for phone cable and internet is scheduled and then a few minutes later an email from credit karma saying i had a hard inquiry called in and spoke to different departments finally to a woman to tell me she couldnt remove it because calling in to inquire about service was all the consent they needed this clearly doesnt seem legal and wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences and what i should do next tldr spoke to att they asked for social i made sure it wouldnt hit my credit i was told it wouldnt and then it did what next edit filed a complaint with my attorney general edit filed a complaint with the cfpb all the support and advice here has been a true blessing and i thank each and every one of you for taking the time to comment with good advice andor possible solutions edit i called back in and actually had a great conversation with someone who was super understanding and willing to help she got me to the fraud department i spoke with dorothy she told me that it did not matter that i asked my credit not to be ran that when someone calls in to inquire about service they are consenting to a credit check doesnt matter if i didnt give my social they would have used my dob or dl she told me that i could not speak to a supervisor as this was standard practice and she wouldnt escalate it she also said some calls are recorded and some werent and she did not help me in finding the call from my first conversation i then asked her for a copy of this call and her response was i dont know if its being recorded so i cant help you she had nothing to say about the rep lying to me and she said their credit disclaimer statement didnt sound anything like a credit disclaimer statement and i probably didnt even know it was read to me unbelievable this is their fraud department jesus christ edit i see a lot of folks saying whats the big deal couple points will fall off in no time i just got an email from credit karma that a hard inquiry from years ago just fell off my report and that left me with one hard hit which was back in january ive been working very hard on rebuilding my credit checking quite frequently and really boosting my score one or two points may not be a big deal to some but after working so hard to improve my score having it lowered without my authorization or consent is devastating
b6fy9b,personalfinance,2019-03-28 07:48:14,wife had yearly review today instead of a higher wage they converted everyone from hourly to salary but her overall salary reduced by k per year wife works for a very small start up company with people owners and employees she is in design past year she was working at hr full time with health benefits but no paid vacation hr is very fair for her skillset in design especially for los angeles she was on wage not salary she worked some ot but not a whole lot if you calculate the standard hourly to salary using hours a week multiply she would have earned she is normally scheduled to work full time mon to fri however last year we got married and had vacations here and there and she was compensated total because of the unpaid vacations this worked out well for her small company because she didnt get paid while being away today during her evaluation they low balled and offered a salary of with ptoyear health benefits are also included but it is the same as last year the total compensation now is they said this was calculated based on the number of hours worked last year so they pretty much offered her w employees are not going back to wage i would assume an employer would calculate a salary offer based on potential full time hours not how many hours one worked the year prior if she had pto last year or if she didnt go on the long honey moon then she would have received a higher salary offer now her starting salary is pretty much hr so its a huge downgrade and now without ot the owners said well look we are giving you pto now which would offset the low ball she is valuable at her company of products sold are her designs the other employee got a raise cause he was getting significantly less paid last year due to no degree and no experience in case you were wondering is this practice normal for an employer to use previous years w to determine someones salary especially if it works in their advantage she will try to counter back with equity since she started the company with them during their meeting yesterday they stated that employees salary do not require hour work periods only the projects need to be done because of that she wants to request working a maximum of hours a week to offset the k a year reduction any advice st edit i shouldnt have wrote this long piece and gone to sleep i will answer everyone when i get to a computer thanks for all your help first thing i need to recalculate her w because she definitely didnt take months off which everyone is calculating a big piece is missing here i saw that in the last paychecks she got paid k and i need to double check second she is very valuable to her team anyone is replaceable but she is more difficult to replace she knows their vision she came up with the company name and all her designs are most of the ones being sold now plus she designed the logo all the packaging website everything everything has been her idea when she pointed out the products to me on their website most of them were either made by her or she had some type of influence directing the other designer she had some creative director responsibilities too the reason why they are doing salary is because it helps employees out by more flexible scheduling dont need to go in if work is all done this is true however they r low balling her because they are not making any money right now and simply cant afford her right now its true they arent making money she asked for equity at the first meeting yesterday and they said thats probably not the best idea for you because we arent worth much wtf nd edit i am reading a lot of responses and they are all helpful but i cant respond to all of them one thing to clarify is that i know for a fact she didnt take weeks of vacation thats ludicrous they did shut down for weeks or so during the holiday and she didnt get paid for it she also doesnt get paid for holidays like during thanksgiving and such we took a max of weeks of vacation last year not i am going to sit down with her tonight to get the math straight

7lv6j3,personalfinance,2017-12-24 13:40:20,free tax filing software program offered to anyone making k with tax season fast approaching i wanted to make everyone aware of a littleknown fact that if you make less than a year you are eligible for free tax filing and preparation the government has a contract with tax prep companies like hr block that allows for free tax filing for of americans you can use the tax prep software that companies normally charge for without paying a penny if you go through the irss website the program opens in january to file your tax returns the irss advertising budget for this program is so very few people realize it exists last year only of eligible taxpayers used this system most people paid the companies to prepare their taxes because they werent aware of this great program it is literally the same programs the companies charge for being offered for free if youre interested in why companies would offer their products for free its because it prevents the government from offering a free filing option so long as tax companies offer free filing to of us taxpayers the government will not offer a competing tax prep option per the contract they just work very hard to make sure no one actually knows the free filing option exists so we continue to pay them to prepare our taxes use this program and please tell everyone you know so they can take advantage of it too
4tlqsd,personalfinance,2016-07-19 15:36:45,eli personal finance tips for older young adults us yes its meback with a second installment in our series eli this assumes you read eli even the linksyoull learn x more from the links and have done things pertaining to your situation the here means youre done with fulltime education have a career with meaningful income and are responsible for your own support some people start this at some at age is not important specifics pertain to the us in some cases this assumes you are a single childless renter employee eli will cover marriage home ownership and children you have money now congratulations read this excellent summary of how to handle it heres a ginormous flowchart showing what to do first bills loans investments good selfstudy well highlight three big ideas to get you started taxes your employee income is taxed withheld like so of the first k goes to social securitymedicare taxes we hope you will benefit in the future too then your income is taxed at higher rates as you make more assuming no special deductions for the first k due to standardish deductions then of the next k of the next k and then tax rate kicks in this is your rate from k to k gross income so a popular rate its only up to k as well this is your tax bracket marginal tax rate most states also have state income taxes of ish but they vary a lot higher brackets only affect your additional income you always come out ahead even if more income means a new top tax bracket you reduce your taxes with credits and deductions big idea is reduce your current taxes by making less of your income taxable debt you borrow money now so you can spend it yay but then you have to pay it back and typically pay back more than you borrowed boo youve lost money as a result the extra amount you repay is determined by the interest rate the annual rate is called apr apr student loan youll pay annual interest on not bad apr car loan youll pay not good apr credit card youll pay yikes never do this you repay the money you borrowed too thats called principal the longer you take to repay the loan the smaller each payment but the more interest youll then pay its a tradeoff big idea is reduce the amount of interest you pay by getting lower interest rates and avoiding quickly repaying higher interest debt investing in eli i noted bank interest wont make you rich the good news in eli is investments can make you current millionaire rich the catch is it takes decades and you must regularly invest significant sums this why you start at the eli introduction to investments is based on the target date fund wherein you buy shares of a mostly stockbased index fund designed to be worth a lot more when you retire at a target date years in the future historically these accounts gain about annually after inflation though it varies significantly year to year your money doubles every years and goes up by x in years all numbers are after taking inflation into account so that you put aside at could easily be worth of todays dollars at but there could be years where you temporarily lose even of your savings do not panic it will come back eventually big idea is invest early and often for your future especially your retirement got the the big ideas now good lets see how we combine them for some meaningful benefits for your yearold self retirement contributions you are going to retire someday invest and perhaps reduce current taxes by letting your employer contribute a percent of each paycheck to your k account or similar things with different names for government employers a recommended investment percentage is but its up to you more is better the annual maximum is the cardinal rule is take the match if you have one a typical employer adds of your salary when you contribute so thats like free money take the match your actual match depends on your employers rules the money is invested for you available penaltyfree when you retire after age usually if you change jobs the money can go with you a k can only invest in what your employer offers most employers have target date funds so choosing one is an easy decision if you need or want to you can sometimes achieve an even better result by picking other available choices what do you mean perhaps reduce current taxes retirement savings are wery wery complicated thank your congresspeople a traditional k reduces your current taxes because it exempts your contributions from your taxable income you pay taxes when you take the money out deferring the taxes but you still pay something if you would prefer you can reverse this if your employer offers a roth option in that case you pax taxes on your k contributions but no taxes when you take the money out the best choice is complex for those below the bracket roth is usually better yet more retirement options iras individual retirement accounts are doityourself ks you set up an account with a company like vanguard schwab or fidelity and give them up to annually to invest for you you have more investment choices target date funds plus other options depending on your income level and whether you have an employer k you open a traditional or roth ira with tax treatment equivalent to the previously described k types iras are your goto option if you have no employer k but you still may and even should want to use an ira especially a roth ira even if you have one you can tap ira and k resources before retirement for certain allowable reasons though its not usually recommended because you lose future gains and might owe current taxes a roth ira is the best choice for raidable retirement savings because contributions can be taken out at any time without taxes or penalties ok that was a lot of information ready to repay student loans lets find out if you do have student loans the interest rate clock is ticking loans are typically year repayment so youll owe about of the loan balance each month for ten years if you owe thats month like a car payment not terrible if you owe that will be month like a mortgage payment only without the house not fun to pay you have to pay these back unless you get them forgiven you have several approaches available for repayment pay them back on schedule it sounds crazy but it just might work if your income supports it pay the minimum on lowinterest loans if you have even more income repay them faster with extra payments especially on higher interest loans and save by paying less interest than you would over time this is your primary option on private loans if you have highinterest private loans look into refinancing them if you have good income and credit youll qualify for lower interest rates if you have a lot of federal loans but little income look into reduced payment plans like incomebased repayment ibr and payasyouearn paye plans youll pay less even nothing each month based on your current income but youll pay longer and ultimately pay more over time in many cases if you are really in a deep hole maybe over k federal with only k annual income give a special look into public service loan forgiveness pslf this program allows you to work for ten years in public service make minimal payments then your unpaid balance is magically forgiven which is a really sweet deal if you can get it this differs from forgiveness programs for ibrpaye that will charge you taxes on any amount forgiven in the future enough about student loans lets wrap up with a few other topics of general interest to year olds grad school can be a good idea but can also be a very expensive idea if you are sure this is for you try to get someone else to pay for it whether the school via scholarships stipends or your employer if they do education reimbursement med school is worth the money no matter who pays law school and mba return on investment is iffier these days going to grad school because you are not sure what else to do is probably a big mistake especially so if you have to pay for it you may be responsible for your health insurance you could be on your parents plan until age in many cases though that may cost them something if your employer will pay for it thats your best option they may offer a lowerpremium high deductible health plan hdhp where you pay routine costs but insurance kicks in for major expenses this is a good choice if you have good health and make few claims you should take advantage of a healthcare savings account hsa with an hdhp this lets you deduct contributions to pay for outofpocket medical expenses with other unique features that make them attractive you can contribute annually to your hsa some employers pay some of this for you as more free money if your employer doesnt offer health insurance and you cant use your parents plan youll want to get an individual plan such as those found on healthcaregov you can only sign up at certain times including open enrollment in november december if you dont have health insurance of some form you could pay a penalty of up to at tax time unless you have an exemption with more income you can rent a nicer place within the same of takehome guideline you may not even want a roommate of course any money you spend on housing is money you dont have for other things living with your parents is still a viable option if you want to save eg to pay down student loans please make sure you have renters insurance its well worth the small cost note that we assume you are not yet ready to buy a house you may not yet be sure where you want to live longterm have limited work history or have insufficient down payment you can also afford a nicer car since you have better credit and lower insurance rates you dont have to upgrade your car and youll save money if you dont paying cash is still an option but if you qualify for a car loan consider taking it to free your money for purposes like retirement investments and loan repayments a good target price is perhaps k with a k loan which works out to years at month your total costofcar would be about k annually selling your old car privately should get you more than you would by trading it in to a dealer with more expenses budgeting becomes much more important youll want to have a bigger emergency fund we recommend at least three months expenses to cover that bad day when you lose your job and your car breaks with more expenses to track look into a program like you need a budget ynab or mint to help keep track of where your money is and where it needs to be in the future look for ways to economize where you can whether by cheaper cellphone plans learning to cook so you want to eat at home or taking advantage of employee discounts while you dont have a lot of tax deductions yet outside of retirement hsa savings take a look at possible tax breaks for student loan interest moving expenses associated with a job change and certain tuition expenses american opportunity tax credit you dont have to itemize to take advantage of these but income limits apply in some cases whew that was a long one i think that does it for this week eli next week marriage children home ownership life insurance job

cgyf7l,personalfinance,2019-07-23 21:01:08,paying attention to my k saved my companys employees this is a post about how even a little bit of attention can go a long way for you and others i work for a company with employees across north america since finding the personal finance communities two years ago my family has been keeping an eye on our budgeting and saving and i was having fun with it so i started also keeping track of contributions into my k nothing major just a yearly look to see contributions matches my company matches and dividends one year i logged into my k provider fidelity and ran my transaction history total for a year and what caught my eye was a fee for to that date i had never seen a fee before i called my hrbenefits and they confirmed they had jumped the gun but that starting next year every employee would have a recordkeeping fee charged yearly they reimbursed me the for that year but i learned a lesson ks and the hr departments behind a company were not infallible i added fees to my mental thing to check on during my yearend check years went by until this last year this year in february i pulled the totals for my k and noticed that my contribution and my yearend total seemed off by about or so i couldnt figure it out finally i went to the transaction history of my k and looked through it and there i saw it a company match of negative back in march it was the strangest thing it wasnt tied to any actual contribution it was just sitting out there all by itself it wasnt even listed under fees it was just a negative company match shout out to everyone who has ever complained about their company match or lack thereof at least youve never had a negative one and i knew it wasnt just those dollars i was missing it was all those dollars that those dollars were going to make and the dollars those dollars would make for decades to come i started asking around my hr department said there were no reported problems and that if i wanted a detailed walkthrough of my k contributions i could wait two weeks until i had a meeting with the benefits coordinator i said schedule it but i didnt stop there i started asking my coworkers and guess what everyone had a negative company match on that date i had confirmed cases then then the amounts all varied but it was always on the same march date by this point i got enough people riled up that i ended up talking to the head of benefits who confirmed that okay maybe there was a problem it took months for them to confirm at which point we found out that a payroll trueup calculation had incorrectly counted a week that crossed from yeartoyear as two weeks and then had automatically corrected for the doubled amount it took more months for them to finally correct it im sure some of my coworkers contribute less and some contribute way more but employees meaning that every person in the company had a hand in some missing from their k but i was the only one who had bothered to check i know most people dont ever calculate out their paycheck or look at their k and im not saying you should on a daily weekly or even monthly basis but every once in a while take or minutes and grab that paper copy of your paycheck or hit that forgot password button log on to your system and take a little look over how much money youre getting be it paycheck k or whatever and see whether it makes sense to you you might be surprised what you find edit wow i return from work to see this has blown up thank you for all the great insights and feedback if just one person improves their path to better finances ill be happy
6g146m,personalfinance,2017-06-08 14:01:01,be prepared if youre resigning or quitting have been fired or are being laid off a pf checklist theres a long list of things you need to worry about when separating from your job regardless of how or why that is happening it is often an emotional time but missing a few key steps could be troublesome down the road this checklist is intended to apply for most situations including resigning or quitting a job being fired from a job or being laid off navigating the end of a contract as a contractor is not really the focus of this post but some steps may still apply some specifics will only apply to the us eg retirement account types filing for unemployment health care if youre aware of a guide for any other countries please make a comment before resigning or if you are at risk of being let golaid off it hopefully goes without saying but you should already have a firm job offer in hand before resigning unless you have a different plan like heading back to school likewise if you are at risk of being let go or laid off you should be building your network at the very least if not outright looking for a new position do you have a retirement plan with your employer eg k b simple ira sep ira or tsp note that many employers will require to to pay off any outstanding loans you have made against your retirement plan if thats the case you will have only days after separation to pay off the balance to avoid early distribution taxes and penalties plan out what youll do with your k or other employersponsored retirement account recognize that you will be giving up any unvested matching for your retirement plan have a plan for the first few months after the job figure out what youll do for health insurance sign up for your own via cobra or the aca switch to a spouses plan or wait to get coverage with new employer consider whether you will want to convert your group life insurance policy to an individual policy make sure you have enough money to carry you into your next job without dipping into your emergency fund set up a budget and examine your general financial situation emergency funds are for unexpected circumstances if you are planning on moving understand that landlords often want to see proof of a job and income which may make getting a new place more difficult make copies of any performance reviews professional certifications or other personal documents that youll want to keep as well as your current vacation balance salary information etc having a copy of your contract and benefit information on a personal computer is also recommended as you might not have access to them in the future however do not take copies of any work performed without written approval from management this is not your property and is equivalent to stealing backup commonly by emailing a copy to your personal email or copying to a thumb drive and remove all personal files from your work computer work phone and any other device be prepared for what youll do or say if your manager makes a counteroffer many people say its a bad idea to stay after attempting to resign but it can also go well dont give more than two weeks of notice if leaving immediately and not being paid for your remaining time would be a financial hardship if you received stock options received a hiring bonus or receive ongoing monetary bonuses or rsus examine your vesting schedule and consider whether you may have to return any bonus money eg hiring bonus moving stipend education assistance before you decide when to quit dont expect to collect options rsus or bonuses during your notice period because you might be terminated immediately its better to wait to give notice until after any important vesting dates you should still give two weeks purchase any stock options that are in the money check on your benefits and find out what happens to them upon leaving do you get your outstanding vacation days paid out or do you lose them meaning

will run into again in the future keep it professional bring a box with you leave it in your car if you cant bring it in discreetly to allow for easy packing of any personal possessions in case you

a noncompete clause or waiving certain rights to sue in exchange for severance pay andor other benefits note that noncompete clauses are very difficult to enforce in some states you absolutely need to read the entire document before signing and its your decision to make consult an attorney if you need help send any goodbye emails later from a personal email account dont spam aliases for an entire company or large departments unless it is a very small number of people under people do not send anything right away because your emotions will be running high after leaving if you were laid off or fired apply for unemployment as soon as you can assuming you were not fired for misconduct ie terminated for cause the entire process can take weeks so do this as soon as possible any life insurance coverage through your employer will terminate after you leave sometimes immediately sometimes at the end of the month consider converting your group life insurance policy to an individual policy especially if others depend on your income or if you have medical conditions that may prevent you from getting an individual policy on your own the cost tends to be low but you will only have a limited amount of time to do this usually days or until the end of the current month but dont count on that move your k or other employeesponsored retirement account to your new plan or a rollover ira if that was your plan get on linkedin and link up with the excoworkers who would say good things about you and vice versa get health insurance if needed see above theres a day grace period after leaving your job for cobra election you can get coverage retroactively but signing up for aca coverage may be less expensive make sure you have a plan for how you will sell any company stock inform your new employer about how much youve already contributed to your k for this calendar year to avoid exceeding the contribution limit note that you may have another paycheck or two still coming from your old employer after you quit so it may take a little time to figure this number out being unemployed unless you have a signed job offer in hand its time to actually act like you are unemployed

69evwg,personalfinance,2017-05-05 14:07:55,we decided not to buy a bearded dragon my wife and i were looking at getting a bearded dragon for our son for his birthday a young beardie is only about so we set aside in our budget counting on buying a reptile aquarium and some incidentals then we learned it needs expensive uv bulbs that last about months and are about each also the electricity cost the run this heat hours can be a drain on the electric bill also the beardie needs to go to the vet every months for a checkup and finally food they have a very diverse diet and can eat up to per week in foods so i did a total cost analysis for a beardie that lives years and it turned out to be a whopping life pro tip do a total cost analysis on pets before deciding to purchase even free pets are absurdly expensive in years both of my kids are going to be in college and i will desperately need then i will not need an aging lizard edit for everyone giving me shit about my poor son dont pity him first he didnt know about the beardie second we are taking that and taking him to an amusement park hes fine edit this post is not about dont buy pets theyre expensive the post is about make sure youre aware of the full cost of something before making a decision yes we have kids and dogs yes theyre more expensive than lizards but for us well worth the cost a reptile not so much edit thank you all for the youre way overestimating and the youre way underestimating posts the accuracy of the cost really isnt the issue the issue is we were expecting something minimal and almost made a big mistake the point is we did the research and it was way more than we were expecting and wanting to pay to us it wasnt worth it we have other pets we arent frugal but we are smart with our money i am simply encouraging others to do cost analysis and at the end of the day if a bearded dragon is worth k to you awesome do it

ac96zf,personalfinance,2019-01-03 19:30:42,days later bank of america is refusing to refund over in fraudulent charges made in texas while we were miles away in illinois back in july we were wrapping up our yearly road trip to illinois we purchased gas around or am right before we started the hour trip to texas xb two hours into the trip my wife gets a notification on her phone from bank of america alerting her to fruadulent charges being made we only have one debit cad xb while we were starting our driving home someone in austin tx purchased around in merch at home depot drove towards houston tx attempting twice to use our card at the atm which did not work because they didnt have the pin they made their ish last transaction at tj maxx north of houston before were alerted and had the card shut off austin to houston is about a hour car ride xb my wife immedately makes a claim days later we get the money credited back while they continue the investigation which seems pretty open and shut to me they also say it may be another days before they finish their investigation xb october they send a letter stating that they have completed their investigation our records show the transaction activity in question was authorized for and posted to your account the letter states theyll be taking the back on october xb wife calls and has them reopen the case or escalate it were told it could be another days xb december we call bank of america again this agent has no record of anything being escalated says he will escalate it and we should hear from someone in the next few business days nothing xb jan wife calls them again this agent states that while an escalation sends an email to their investigators notifying that we are still asking about they case they are under no obligation to complete it xb after reading a bit into the law surrounding this we have realized we can request the documentation they used to close the investigation xb what else can we do do we need a lawyer if they had to reimburse us for the first days of the investigation why do they not have to temporarily reimburse us as they continue to investigate for as long as they need with no date set for resolution on our end xb it is blatantly obvious that someone skimmed the card at some point and had a dummy one made are they able to continue to withhold our indefinitely and just keep saying nope looks good until we tire out xb our kiddos missed out on a lot of christmas gifts because of this and now bills are starting to get a bit tight we really need this money back thanks yall update started posting on social media before i start filing complaints minutes later bank of america contacted me on twitter will update later thanks for everyones advice update hours later i continued to

the phone with someone in the fraud department at bank of america i recorded the whole convo and will be uploading it to youtube she says the call on oct did in fact reopen the case even though the rep on dec said otherwise and the rep earlier today said they have no timeline to adhere to and can take as long as they want they now have business days from oct to finish the claim once again she says one of the reasons that the claim was denied was because the didnt attempt to drain her account they hit up two atms and failed to use the pin to drain the account so they dont even have the correct info to base their findings off i requested documentation about the claim as law allows and she says i should get that in business days they now have until jan to notify us of their findings

4b91pt,personalfinance,2016-03-20 20:06:22,successfully negotiated a raise in salary thanks pf i recently decided i wanted to move on from my job for a variety of reasons one of the main reasons was i felt i was undervalued so with a lot of research here is how i went from to i felt i was undervalued so i needed to prove it i needed another job obviously i needed to know how to negotiate i needed to make sure i knew my bottom line and what i really wanted making the decision so lets start with number am i undervalued i needed to research how much my job title was worth for this i went to the bureau of labor statistics salarycom glassdoorcom and google has nearly ever piece of info you need to decide what your position is worth salarycom and glassdoorcom also where close to bls dont settle on one source for anything do realize when doing this part that you need to take into consideration the local job market in your area where i live for example i know my area pays less than the median because my cost of living is alot lower than most other places so when you decide what the median pay is for what you do be realistic for me the median pay was my current job was paying me so number one was finished i am being undervalued on to number find another job i needed to find other places of employment in my area doing what i wanted to do for this i went to the google as it has all the answers i made profiles on careerbuilder indeed glassdoor and monster i updated my resume and started applying for everything i thought i would want to do it is important to realize when applying for jobs it is time consuming and will get frustrating repeating your self over and over but you need to stay diligent also it is worth your time to tweak your resume to match key words in the application you are applying for i wish i would have known the importance of networking as well sometimes the best opportunities are ones you get by someone mentioning your name to the right person never burn bridges and always reach out to those who may be able to vouch for you anyway i applied for a week straight then slowly the calls and emails started rolling in hell yes by the end of the week i had interviews setup i was amazed on just how easy it could be to get the process started then the hard part came interviewing my interviews went awesome i researched what to say and how to say it how to accent my strengths and all that jazz the best piece of advice on how to interview well is read google is your best friend for me the best things were my drive to succeed and my willingness to learn many employers will pick people who are driven over people with alot of experience obviously you need to have some skills but dont underestimate the power of persistence employer a gave me a range for the job pretty easily when i asked about it this makes your negotiating power much higher as most of you know but the range was way to low i knew already this place was out but i thanked them for the interview anyway sometimes you just are to far apart to waste each others time any further be polite though if this happens and move on employer b wanted to know how much i wanted for a salary i thought oh yea i know not to say anything i am so clever well they didnt budge the wouldnt give me a range and they kept at me sometimes this will happen handle it accordingly i gave them a high range kk they seemed ok with it employer c was the same way as employer b i handled it the same number negotiation so i received offers in weeks wait you got offers at all places hell yes i did one offer was lower than i wanted so employer a was out be sure to thank everyone for there time and offers remember dont burn bridges but the other offers where above the median income i researched this further made me realize im definitely worth more than im making now employer b was at employer c was at it was almost surreal for me to hear these numbers this validated my thoughts and research of being undervalued even further there is a myriad of things to negotiate dont just think about salary but the overall package this article helped me alot when preparing dont be afraid to tell people what you want but dont go overboard no one is going to pay you a year to clean toilets now that i have these offers i can leverage one against the other this works the best when you know a company really wants you i spoke with both companies back and forth and i knew employer b was the winner damn this is crazy k to k in weeks i go to my current boss and tell him whats happening i was upfront and honest about everything thats usually the best way to go then my current employer decides to counter offer what the hell do i do now my brain is on overload through much reading and researching i found that counter offers are generally a bad idea to accept i mean i wanted to leave anyway that hasnt changed so i took the counter offer and spoke with the other employer b about it they decide to match the salary and i negotiate more days off is this really happening k number knowing what you really want and what you bottom line is the offer of was above and beyond my bottom line the overall package of benefits matched my expectations the job is what i wanted to do you need to know this stuff going in and be able to walk away when someone does meet your bottom line staying strong and not budging on this bottom line is essential finally making the decision the hardest part of all this stuff is making an actual decision im going from to in either decision i make im on the winning side either way try and take your emotions out of it and look at the facts for me i decided to take the new opportunity and take the plunge into the unknown do not second guess yourself i realize my situation may not be average getting a raise probably isnt typical but the fact remains that it is possible to negotiate a better lifestyle it is nerve racking intense anxiety inducing and difficult but it is all worth it in the end i hope this helps at least one person in their pursuit of a better life thanks pf for all the help and courage to tackle the unknown
5dnijg,personalfinance,2016-11-18 17:07:19,bank of america is refusing to give back to my dads account after someone fraudulently stole his funds on the night of november stearly morning of november nd someone made separate withdrawals of eachtotal at atm machines in tarrytown white plains and lower manhattan from my dads account and then phone transferred another from his savings account to his checking account then the thief made three purchases at target with a debit card charging and respectively the total amount that was taken out of my fathers account was when he checked his email on november th my father immediately called bank of america and notified them of the fraud and filed two claims one for the saving and one for the checking accounts after waiting several business days for the result of the investigation my father called bofa to check on the status of the claim and was told the claims could not be paid because they did not see any errors on their part with their system they reopened the claim but then closed it again several days later i dont understand how the bank can deny responsibility my dad has never told anyone the pin number for his debit cardnot even members of his own family when you put money in a bank it is suppose to be safe and now he feels violated because not only was this money stolen from him but now they are trying to say that they are not at fault he was informed by a bofa associate that someone had called in requesting a new debit card on oct but he did not make a call to bofa on that date i dont understand why the bank would allow this unusual activity to go through or how they could let a thief phone transfer his money between his savings and checking accounts also how can the bank authorize a new debit card to be mailed and what exactly is required for this request to be granted he did not make the call to request a new debit card where are the security checks in place for any of this my father filed a police report and the detectives assured him at that time that the bank would return the cash they said that as long as the fraud is reported within days the bank has an obligation to return the funds the last time he spoke with a bofa manager in a local branch they actually reassured him that he would be getting his money back and that the process just takes time but this is the letter that my father received from bofa today weve completed our investigation of your above referenced claim and based on our findings were unable to honor the claim because the transfer was made to an account that you own and the funds were made available to you for personal use used to pay an obligation owed by you or both as a result were respectfully denying your claim what you need to know we based our decision on our records and the information you provided when you contacted us about your accountif you have additional information pertaining to the transactions please contact us at the tollfree number listed below you may request copies of the documents used in our investigation and well mail the information to you for your records we now consider this claim closed were here to help please call us tollfree at monday through friday between the hours of am to pm et if you have any questions fraud and claims at this point what should he be doing contacting the local news getting a lawyer and suing bofa i asked him to mail a certified letter with return receipt to bofa so that there is a paper trail of all of this according to the ftc he should be fully covered edit thank you all for your replies and comments i will do research into what federal agencies to file complaint at and i will keep everyone updated on any additional details in the meantime i will try to answer some of the questions that were posed the thief called bofa and requested a new atmdebit card on october th and it was mailed to my parents home address i believe that whoever called bofa to request the card also stole it from the mail my moms account at bofa was not compromised but my parents were very upset and did not want to take any chances so they requested replacement cards for both their accounts their accounts are not linked after the incident bofa mailed my dads debitatm card and pin on separate days as requested but my moms new debitatm card and pin still arrived in the mail on the same day i am guessing that this is how the thief was able to get ahold of the cardpin a lot of people are asking why the withdrawal limit was so high my dad received a letter in the mail a few days after the fraud occurred letting them know that their withdrawal limit was increased to apparently the thief called in and requested to increase the daily limit they then made x withdrawals right before midnight on november st and x withdrawals in the early morning of november nd by the time my dad got the notice that his withdrawal limit had been increased his money was already long gone i have no idea why the thief had to do a phone transfer to move the remaining k from the savings account to the checking account i would think that you could do a transfer right at the atm i think there should be a recording of all of these various phone transactions and bofa frankly does not care to look into them they also dont care to look at the videos from the atms edit update great news bank of america has returned the money to my dads bank account he received an email to log into his bofa account to check some new messages after he logged in he saw that his funds had been returned and the messages stated that his subsequent follow up claims had been approved the next step is to find out from bofa and exactly what information the perpetrator had that allowed them to request a new debit card from bofa to be mailed to my dads address i saw a lot of comments that asked why my dad didnt file a police report but he did i realize that the first post was a huge block of text but i did mention that he filed a police report its just buried in that text a lot of people also mentioned that it might be someone close to him such a a family member but this is pretty much impossible my mom and dad immigrated to the us over years ago so we actually dont have any other family members here as the rest of the extended family is overseas im their only child and i live on the west coast while they still live in ny i also doubt that they fell into bad company because they are some of the most straight laced boring people youll ever meet lol they dont drink gamble smoke etc in any case the next step is definitely to figure out how this happened in the first place hopefully bofa will be able to provide us more information in that regards

ag8xhv,personalfinance,2019-01-15 14:17:18,us tax filers making less than per year the irs has a freefile option that is rarely if ever publicized years ago the irs struck a deal with fintech companies the software companies did not want the irs publishing their own programs to allow filers to do their taxes for free instead they made the free file alliance which allows taxpayers making less than k a year adjusted gross income to file their taxes completely for free no strings attached unlike the free offers made by the fintech companies themselves check out the program irs free file ps if you make more than k agi then they offer fillable forms at the link above as well note that turbotax and probably others i would expect it from hr too have two different versions of their free software if you go through the irss site linked above youll get a version that is purportedly not restricted on complexity but is restricted on income that is a different free version than if you just go to the website directly and sign up for the free version there which is heavily restricted to simple returns if youve already signed up on the free version from their main website it sounds like you may have to log out before following the irss link uevaned thanks for helping me clarify
aipwqk,personalfinance,2019-01-22 18:39:46,this was my first year filing my own taxes so i tried different free tax softwares to see which company offered the best service im not here to promote one service over another but i do want to help other first time filers out there as i said above this year was my first year filing my own taxes after getting charged almost for hr block to do it for me in one of their offices last year because of this i decided to enter my taxes on three different free tax service websites hr block turbotax and freetaxusa at the end of the day my primary goal was to distinguish which product was the best bang for my buck i did this not only to ensure i was getting my maximum refund but to also see which was the superior service as i had seen all recommended frequently throughout the sub as someone who is completely new to filing their own taxes freetaxusa was by far the most enjoyable all around experience as enjoyable as doing your taxes can be at least i would recommend to anyone here that plans to file their taxes themselves to use their service and yes i realize everyones tax situation is different so the best service is slightly subjective this was just my experience it was far and away the cheapest option for my situation as it actually honored the free filing option for federal and only cost for state filing discount if you enter freetaxusa in the promo code section at the the end hr and turbotax both shot up to between total cost to file my federal and state returns once i entered in my e misc int and div etc they also hounded me to upgrade to an even more expensive service throughout literally the entire process freetaxusa walked me through the process very efficiently and painlessly they went through every possible type of income credit and deduction i could have and most importantly for me at least they were true to their word of being a free service they didnt steadily increase the price as i entered more information and they didnt try to get me to buy additional products and services i didnt need hope this helps anyone else out there new to the process without a doubt will be using them again next year edit someone asked if there was a difference in the amount of my refund shouldve included that in the original post sorry but for federal no they all came out exactly the same for state yes freetaxusa found an additional on my state refund that hr and turbotax did not find edit as mentioned by another user if you go through ebates you can get an additional off the state fee and it should be stackable with the off promo code however i did not try this personally was unaware at the time and some states give the option to file for free through the state i did not find where my state offers this service however edit i have seen a few people say they were able to get the free service through turbotax and my post may be a little unintentionally misleading in that regard yes i did go through the free file portal with turbotax like i did with the other services however once i began entering my income information that is when i was disqualified from the free service and i was automatically placed into a paid service turbotax does offer free filing but only if you make less than k a year or are a military member that makes less than k a year and im neither sorry if i mislead anyone also it makes a difference in price with hr and turbotax if you have a et self employmentcontract labor income savings account interest an hsa investment income etc and freetaxusa doesnt charge for entering these forms some of these things do apply to my tax situation which is likely a major reason it was so much more expensive to file with hr and turbotax as i said in the post everyones tax situation is slightly different and im not trying to promote certain products over others just wanted to provide my personal experience final edit hopefully a lot of people are under the assumption that you have to wait until the th to file but that is not the case if you have all of your documents you can file earlier the irs may even accept your return early to use while they test out their system i completed mine yesterday and actually got an email from freetaxusa a few minutes ago stating that my refund had been accepted by the irs and i would be getting my refund within days much requested tldr for my tax situation which included several sources of income i would recommend freetaxusa the interface is very user friendly the cost of my service remained free and did not increase as i entered more information i was not pestered to upgrade into a more expensive service throughout the process and i was able to get an additional discount on my state filing cost there are a few people that have said this is some sort of ad full disclaimer i have no affiliation with any of these websites and this is not an ad im just a frequent redditor trying to help out other fellow redditors i work for state government but based off how many people think this is an ad maybe my future is in marketing lol may also have to do with the scammy name of the company i have to admit i was a little skeptical when i first saw it
ayd9uh,personalfinance,2019-03-07 14:38:31,i found k in savings making totally nonlife altering changes ive been wanting to write this for a while a while back i hated my job i was working hour weeks and getting paid doodoo for the effort in response i wrote up an escape plan it included a bunch of ways for me to replace my income but it also included a ton of ways to save money without changing the quality of my life i spent hours and hours making this thing so that id have a plan to follow good news i got out of that hell hole more good news the moneysaving piece is relevant to almost everyone so i figured id share all the ways i found that can help you save a crap ton of money without really having to change your life so without further adieu change your car insurance car insurance companies make most of their money on old clients once you get past a certain age they creep your rates up ever so slowly they are willing to discount your insurance when you switch so we shopped around found the lowest quote and saved a crap ton on the discount they were giving us this was an easy onetime change that affects my life before month after month annual savings threaten your internet provider every internet provider offers promotional rates for your first year then hike your bill after your first year ive never had a problem giving someone a call and telling them that i want to move to another service because they are offering a promotion every time they offer me their promotional rate this is a once a year phone call that saves you a decent chunk of change beforelol after annual savings this wont work if there is only one provider servicing your area sorry comcast slaves switch your phone plan to mint mobile or red pocket these are services that piggyback off of major mobile phone network providers at stupid discounts lines on mint is something like a month its stupid how cheap these lines can be their service is quite good as well before month after month total annual savings use a few credit cards like a debit card if youre in the middle of crawling out of cc debt this is particularly bad advice but if you are basically debt free and can responsibly use your credit card like a debit card paying it off as you go you can save a bunch of money basically every expense besides my mortgage goes through a credit card so i can reap those sweet sweet rewards between cards i get rewards that include on gas on dining out on grocery stores and costco on everything else essentially these are discounts on everything before after month annual savings these savings are based on expenses between my fiance and me oil change coupons i refuse to be a coupon lady partly because of my y chromosome but also because the time it takes to effectively coupon is not worth it to me id rather do anything else but oil change coupons are very easy you have to get your oil changed at least once a quarter and googling a coupon for it works of the time you should never pay full price for an oil change im sure some of you are also saying but foofy you could save more by changing your own oil to that i say sure but i dont want to change anything in my life and the hourly savings is like printing a coupon is easier before quarter after quarter annual savings not a lot but seriously this one is so easy buy a smart thermostat i wasted a ton of money by heating an entire house for the sake of my pets they are going to sleep in a sunbeam no matter the temperature so theres lots of savings to be had here you could just remember to turn down the heatair everytime you leave the house but that would require me to change way too much about my habbits instead a smart thermostat hard to give you the before on this one but here we go before monthly savings month annual savings utilize an hsa for those that dont know an hsa is a health spending account the way it works is you put money into it directly from your bank account and all of that money is tax free its basically a free money back on health expenses depending on your tax bracket i grow moles like its my job and in order to avoid dying of skin cancer i have to get them removed constantly this tacks up my health bill may be a little higher than most but still heres the savings i had yours will likely be more or less i can hear it now but my employer doesnt offer an hsa you can actually contribute to an hsa without your employer before after annual savings heres an hsa savings calculator if you want to figure out what you canshould contribute cancel your unusedgym membership if you dont have one well then you cant do this one if you have one and you consistently use it well then dont cancel it that said gyms expect only of people to consistently use thier facilities so theres a good chance that many of you like myself can cancel their membership without affecting their life the x a year you convince yourself youre going to get in shape you can just go run outside instead before after annual savings alright thats all the easy stuff you can do without changing your life the grand total for us came out to just shy of the k i promised to be fair i did put a in front of it not everyone one of these is going to be applicable to every person but i hope you were able to find a few nuggets in here that could save you some money edit someone noted my wonky math that cc rewards didnt add up i forgot to double the amount with my fiance which doesnt perfectly work but is not far off keep in mind that in expenses each going through only our cc would yield each not including all the optimizing we can do she has on online shopping too so month between the two of us in rewards is not that far out of the realm of possibility

5nyiaw,personalfinance,2017-01-14 17:20:28,another example for why having an emergency fund is x better than having morenicer things my wife and i are in our earlymid twenties we have saved a little more than a third of our income over the past two years so we had several thousand dollars in an emergency fund plus extra savings the amount isnt really relevant the point is that we had no plans to use it at the end of we were both in great health and being young we decided to go with my employers hdh plan with an hsa last weekend we blew through the deductible on my wife and we will likely hit the out of pocket maximum before the month is over this health issue came out of nowhere and were very fortunate to have good insurance but because we have extra savings we dont have to make medical decisions based on cost we can pay the full annual out of pocket maximum and we wont really miss it if a doctor thinks a test is necessary we can simply authorize it without worrying about how we will pay for it it has been stressful but i cant imagine how much more stressful it would be if we had to go into medical debt to pay for it all we could have eaten out more last year my wife could drive a nicer car we could live in a bigger apartment or house but i wouldnt trade the freedom of having the extra savings for any of that this came out of nowhere and was frankly highly unlikely it could happen to anyone and we were easily able to pay for it an emergency fund is psychologically emotionally physically and financially is the most important improvement to your quality of life that you can buy in my opinion anyway edit thanks to all for your well wishes and support to those who took this as a criticism of spending please know that this was not my intention my wife and i are not ultra frugal we simply prioritize our spending where we think it will have the greatest impact on our lives in my view an emergency fund is just another thing you buy i feel that of all the things anyone could buy it is the one that will have the greatest impact on your quality of life

5bkffi,personalfinance,2016-11-07 05:08:57,google charged me for tb storage that i did not authorize and now they wont refund my money i received a notification from paypal at pm et that a charge was made on my wifes google play account the payment was for tb storage for month my wifes account is only using gb and google offers gb free so it does not make sense that we would want tb of storage we did not authorize this charge and nobody in my house made this purchase kids are sleeping and wife was taking a shower at the time i called google immediately and they refused to refund the money saying it happened inside the account so basically accusing us that we did it no suggestions to change our passwords and that it might be an unauthorized charge from a different computer no information as to which ip address the charge came from was provided they said to contact paypal to open a dispute if i want google has canceled the storage account so it is no longer active im not sure what to do but this seems like a very unfair policy from google any suggestions update i called again this morning and spoke to another representative michael who was a lot more empathetic and helpful they submitted the return request again and said it should be approved this time also a redditor who works for google reached out to me here on reddit and is checking on the case for me from the inside hopefully i can get this resolved via refund and can close that paypal dispute since we dont want to lose my wifes account if at all possible thanks for the support everyone update success after talking to the second google representative this morning and most likely with help from an anon googler who contacted me via reddit pm they have refunded my money i have closed the paypal dispute and just waiting for the refund to clear currently it is in pending status i told the second call center rep this morning the exact same thing we dont know who made this purchase also i did not mention this reddit post he was super professional empathetic and took care of me even his email was reassuring he said dont worry about it we will take care of this lessons learned be persistent the first call center rep might give you a hard time but calling back validates or tests their stated policy and in my case it proved that they could in fact help me if they wanted to dont leave credit cards or paypal preauthorized payment methods connected for years on end from now on ill be disconnecting these payment methods as soon as they are used its not that hard to retype a credit card or paypal credentials use factor authentication although there is a possibility this could have been done accidentally in my house by my son he still hasnt fessed up this has been an exercise in learning where our security gaps are and making sure were not too naive when it comes to account protection thanks for your help pf community

7uzp28,personalfinance,2018-02-03 14:49:57,i kept a detailed record of how much was spent to have our baby here it is almost three years ago my wife and i had our first kid i kept track of everything that we spent money on that was kid related starting from the pregnancy test to the hospital delivery bill we also estimated the value of any gift we received to give a full itemized bill idea of how much money was spent on our kid before she was even born i made an ugly spreadsheet to track it all i thought about posting this here when i was all done but decided not to because a i just had a kid and was busy and i wasnt ready for the criticism i was inevitably going to receive but now i am ready and less busy so here we go starting with the big number to bring our baby into the world from scratch cost my wife and i spent we estimated receiving in gifts i broke everything down into these categories category cost gear diapers ect baby clothes mom clothes medical books toys bedroom feeding in anticipation of some shock on all this spending ill add that we bought things that we felt would be useful to our lifestyle within our budget and that would last for many years to come we could have spent less and many people do and many people actually go well beyond the most expensive things were the hospital trip to safely have a baby delivery related bills combined having a baby fall out of a woman in a hospital in america is expensive this was after insurance covered their portion a crib mattress that converts to a toddler bed and full size bed total gift kid is almost and we converted the crib to the toddler bed shortly after she turned she wasnt a chewer so its currently in great shape to stay her bed until her teens or beyond mom clothes after seeing this final number i told myself i shouldnt ever gain too much weight because i now know how much a new wardrobe could end up costing me we were at a point in life where most of the items were bought new and that was ok a new glider chair gift i wish we could have found this used but didnt have any luck we wanted one with a high back because im tall im thankful we found one i spent so many nights rocking and dozing in and out of sleep on this thing im very happy with it we still use it nightly for reading bedtime stories the stroller we got one of those fancy bob running strollers i ran over a hundred miles with her and we walked plenty of unpaved trails at our local state park she spent hundreds of hours in this thing this was the only stroller we used otherwise we carried her everywhere in the frontback carrier plus these strollers have a high resale value car seat extra base we have two cars a base for each car was great two camera video baby monitor we did a lot of traveling and having the extra camera to just pack and go was really handy a video monitor is the shit being able to check and see if a noise was just stirring or something more was great a cute rug a cheap rug would have served the same purpose but shit its our first kid sometimes you gotta get that cute thing writing this with the benefit of hind sight i think we actually did a great job of getting the right thing for us on the first try we tried to get things with the idea of potentially having another child of everything major that we bought the monitor is the only thing we would need to replace if another kid sauntered into our lives the battery is now totally useless and one of the cameras died last month also we dropped it so the power cord is soldiered to the chip and im awful at soldiering so it whole housing is glued together to keep it working so can you do this cheaper absolutely buy everything used babies arent all that picky i lived in rural illinois at the time and our availability to get nice used stuff was limited also handmedowns can help tremendously our extended family had kids eight years or more years before us if they had any and lived many states away so most of their baby stuff was gone also dont underestimate the generosity of others there are people out there who love babies and love buying baby things hopefully you know one or two another money saving tidbit use cloth diapers back when i was weighing the benefits of them i found we would break even with cloth over disposable at two years our kid suddenly decided to be potty trained right before christmas so our cloth diapers lasted a bit over years we definitely saved money with cloth if we accidentally have another kid we will save a ton in diapers because the original ones we got are still in great shape also you can find used cloth diapers around which can save tons we hope to sell ours a very appreciable downside to cloth youre guaranteed to be washing the diapers about times per week a shout out to rpredaddit for all the helpful tips and stories that were so great at the time also usteeldirigible usavingsjada and the several updoots for the courage to finally post this on this sub i hope this info helps someone out there

36pnp0,personalfinance,2015-05-21 03:07:52,tricks car salesmen use to take your money how to overcome tricks car salesmen use to take your money purchasing a vehicle from a dealership can be an anxiety inducing experience what i discovered was that the number one emotion women felt when considering buying a vehicle was anxiety followed by uncertainty in this article we will review tricks that dealers and car salesman use that cause this anxiety and uncertainty i will teach you how to overcome these feelings and become immune to the tricks the worst thing that can happen to us as consumers is purchasing something and quickly regretting it this is called buyers remorse and it is a terrible feeling why well you just spent and you are married to a monthly payment for years i do not want this happen to you the following tips are designed to prevent you from being pushed around by the salesman and to ease your mind of worries in regards to overpaying emotional manipulation during my car salesman days we were taught many subliminal tactics to get customers interested in vehicles one is emotional manipulation the reason salesmen often insist on test driving is to get you to create a sense of ownership in your mind maam take a seat adjust the mirrors now adjust the seat until you are comfortable go ahead and turn on your favorite radio station and flip back the sunroof is your heart beating faster and you excitement increasing you are unknowingly getting excited and your mind is taking mental ownership of this nice new vehicle that awesome new car smell isnt helping either is it that feeling of euphoria is a very human response they are counting on you to feel this way what happens next is quite primitive as our excitement builds the emotional part of our brains begins to take over when this happens we are much more likely to make a choice based on emotions have you ever heard of dogs that go crazy and get scared during lightning and thunder storms i had an adorable shizu dog that would run miles away when thunder rumbled the house rip bootsy during these storms the logical part of his brain would turn off and the emotional part would take over in this case fear dictated my dogs behaviors much like my old boy bootsy my mom named him btw this happens to us when we take mental ownership of a new car the budget we set and the price we wanted are now more likely to be negotiable how to overcome trick emotional manipulation be mindful of your emotions simply being aware of this tactic beforehand and how our mindbodies will respond is a half of the battle in not making a poor emotional based decision i always recommend that we sleep on it my rule of thumb is to never make a large purchase the same day this isnt the same as picking up a snickers while in the checkout line this is a figure purchase that we will be married to for the next years be smart go home sleep and revisit it the next day when your mind has had a chance to tend to other matters pushing you towards payments after the test drive we will be directed to go inside sit down fill out our contact information and discuss the price car salesmen are taught to negotiate the payment with us instead of the price of the vehicle this has two benefits for them making an affordable payment is relatable and gets your mind off of the actual price we end up paying more this way see ex at the end for a math based scenario the interest rate and the length of the loan can quickly fall into the background with this payment focused presentation the payments method works because we are more likely to digest the affordability of a a monthly payments versus the figure sticker price over six years a dollar increase is not that much but by doing the math it will add on k to the total price wow thats mindblowing see below how customer saved by focusing on a lower payment this is worth repeatinga monthly difference saved how to overcome pushing you towards payments tell the salesman up front i am not interested in going over payments right now lets stick to the price of the car out the door you must be proactive here a skilled salesman may even give you a rebuttal of well maam i just want to make sure you get something that is affordable and fits your budget just smile at your new adversary and politely say while i appreciate your concern i have all of that figured out please just get me the out the door price make eye contact and smile for added value and enjoyment they will get the picture you want the individual price of the car and that is what you want to negotiate you have now become a formidable opponent you have now indirectly saved yourself hundreds if not thousands of dollars by directing the negotiations down this road see ex at the bottom for a math based scenario on why this works also the out the door price is the price of the car plus all of the fees that the dealer adds on better to know sooner than later what fluff fees the dealers will add the finance office after a price has been agreed upon we are sent into the finance office here you meet the finance manager this person finishes your paperwork gets you financed or takes your check and offers you products to protect your new vehicle this is where even the toughest buyers lose why they lose because their guard is down when we agree upon a price we get a handshake and a congratulations usually the sales manager gets in on this as well you give out a big sigh of relief in my sales days i will never forget this one customer who was an excellent negotiator he knew what he was doing and worked us down to a super low profit he clearly was prepared and this resulted in the dealership making around on the car nice job what happened next really opened my eyes he ended up paying on the warranty and gap products as well as accepting an interest rate higher than he should have explanation of these products below in example all of the money he had just spent his energy and time saving was washed away in the finance office customers let their guard down when a price has been reached with the salesman dont let this happen to you being aware of yourself and the situation is half the battle i want you to know the background of the finance managers and how they get that job its not by going to business school and majoring in finance they get there because at some point they were the top car salesman in the dealership selling cars a month that is part of the car sales business ladder it takes a different set of skills since they are selling an intangible product you cant put your hands on a warranty or an interest rate therefore it takes a higher degree of sales skills to be successful here they are the best at what they do and that is why they get paid the big bucks the first move when we enter the finance office is to make us feel comfortable lets nott let his smile and firm handshake fool us he has one clear goal convince us to buy what he has he doesnt make as much money otherwise he will once again show us the new payments if we were to purchase products a b or c they make money in ways the first is by increasing the interest rate we are charged they borrow your loan money from bank a for and charge you the dealership gets a part of that and the finance manager gets around per point he charges us see ex to see how a increase can cost you well over the second way they make money is by selling us the company warranty or gap products which can vary drastically how to overcome the finance office as before we want to ask for the total price of the product we are interested in it really is a personal preference whether you want any of these or not i personally have and never will get any of them even if they do add free oil changes dont let my stance deter you though because there are some amazing packages out there that add free oil changes for years be ready to pay a little extra than you would normally though the convenience is worth it for some see example below for more information on products and how to get the best deals next if not already done we want to clarify what the interest rate is good luck i hope that this information will allow you to walk into a dealership with confidence i hope this was helpful for you and will aid you in saving hundreds if not thousands of dollars on your next purchase example we are purchasing a car lets say we go in wanting to pay the salesman comes out and says you can choose from a payment of or which one works better for you sir do you see what he did there he changed your price reduction to a payment and asked you a question directing you to pick from his two options many people lose here they say they like one of the payments and lose or they say they negotiate and say they want to be at a month the salesman takes your request to his sales manager they come back at they always come back higher great car is sold lets do the math though you wanted to be at by accepting you just paid for that vehicle and you have no idea what the interest rate is the lesson here keep things simple and stick to the vehicle price first when that is settled then work on payments example a car loan for months at you will pay over the life of the loan assuming you pay normal payments a car loan for months at you will pay over the life of the loan assuming you pay normal payments that is a difference of know your local credit union or banks rates before you finance a vehicle example be familiar with the products before you go into the finance office gap insurance extended warranty the example above was many years ago competition in the warranty market has increased and they are much less expensive nowadays still do your homework and check around credit unions often offer much cheaper products that do more if you finance with them companies like state farm insurance now do auto financing and will give you gap for free if you finance through them my credit union charges for gap dealerships charge and above i hope you can appreciate the value edit editing edit holy shit i love gooohohohohooold front page thanks reddit for confirming im on point with the writing and material there really is a problemopportunity with an industry that triggers so many negative emotions just at the thought of it

94jaab,personalfinance,2018-08-04 13:55:57,if you get highs spending money consider downloading an app that lets you pay down student loans this isnt my idea but i couldnt find who posted it long ago when i saw it well i did it and its worked well i found myself going out for a drink or bite to eat when i didnt really have a great reason to instead i took that money i would have spent and payed down a loan with a quick click not always it feels great about as great as i felt getting that drink on the way home after work i did try robinhood too but that felt very different to me and wasnt as rewarding edit the app i use is my lenders great lakes people here are saying use changed as well which works like acorn edit yes i know playing the market may yield more than paying down my lower interest loans but thats not the point it is to chip away at a daunting year loan it is also no risk
6hlgar,personalfinance,2017-06-16 09:21:01,student loan balance thank you pf for all of your help and please accept my personal contribution edit updated template can be found here edit several people requested access to the spreadsheet you shouldnt need to request access you should be able to file make a copy please pm me if you are unable to do so i was raised in a family where finances were not ever discussed other than the fact that we did or did not have it my father was an optimistic entrepreneur who struck gold time and time again on many of his business ventures but always found a way to blow through his riches with little to show for it factor in my mother who was a hoarder and you had the perfect formula for disaster i wont stroll too deep down memory lane but long story short i never completed my college degree and decided to go straight into the workforce instead seven years ago i was laid off from a job that was paying the bills with no degree to fall back on i made the decision to go back to school and about two years into my degree i was caught in a financial bind worrying about how i was going to take care of next semesters tuition fortunately for me i had an amazing aunt uncle sister and bil who helped cover my expenses after that incident i swore to myself that as soon as i graduated i would take charge of my own finances and do everything in my power to avoid going down the same path as my parents ive been a longtime lurker and have read countless personal stories shared on this subreddit throughout the years even if the situation didnt apply to my own life i took the time to sympathize with what others are going through in the event that i too may one day endure the same hardship i silently cheered behind the scenes along with each success story shared this sub is a daily read for me and became my source of encouragement towards living a debtfree life today i get to share my own success story i made a plan after graduating to aggressively pay off my student loans and have been blessed enough to have the means to do i have made the final payment on my student loans from to in months along with the good news i wanted to give back to the community that has been so helpful all these years i created a spreadsheet to track my various finances and im hoping that it will help others as well personal finance template it may seem like there is a lot going on but i will try my best to describe each tab indepth to make it seem less scary student loans my student loans were broken down into different groups a b c d at different interest rates i wanted to calculate the total interest over the life of each loan based on a set payment amount so i made a rough amortization chart f enter your interest rate h enter your desired monthly payment m enter your loan balance i wanted to find the sweet spot for what i felt comfortable paying while also trying to minimize the total accrued interest as best as i could so i played around with various numbers for h as an example i entered in h now i am searching for the row where the value in column m is negative this happens in m that means that if i make a monthly payment of h i would pay it off in months g and accrue of total interest k i repeated the same process for the recommended minimum payment from my student loan provider and and then made a chart in or i calculated the savings based on how much less interest i would pay over the life of the loan if i paid more than the minimum payment this became such a big motivator for me to continue to make aggressive payments that i decided to add it to the summary tab summary this tab is exactly what it sounds like it is a summary of all of my finances so that i can get a snapshot view of where my money is along with my net worth average credit score and student loan savings b i update this formula once a month currently the formula is q pointing to the spreadsheet when june ends i will simply update the formula to point to q b this is also updated monthly next month i would change the formula from credit scoref to credit scoref this is where the bulk of the work comes in a enter the date of the posted transaction if the transaction is still pending leave the date blank until it has posted b enter the merchant for the transaction this column uses the merchants tab for data validation to add a new merchant simply add another entry in column a of the merchants tab c enter the category for the transaction this simply helps categorize your spending use the categories tab for data validation d enter all credit transactions to your bank account in this column e enter all debit transactions to your bank account in this column fj i have four credit cards that i use in rotation enter all credit card transactions under the corresponding column adjust columns as needed k this column shows the current balance of your bank account lp these columns shows the current balance of each of your credit cards q i call this column the reality check it shows your true balance the cash you have in your bank account minus all of the debts across your credit cards st this gives you a breakdown of where you are spending your money it is another helpful way to keep your spending in check and should help you budget it might seem like a lot of work but it has become routine enough for me that it takes me no more than minutes in the morning my routine log into charles schwab enter pending transactions columns bj enter dates for previously pending transactions column a repeat for citi discover amex capital one select the columns that are out of order then click data sort sheet by column a a z lets go through an example in tab i have the following pending transactions after logging into my accounts i found that these transactions are all posted now so i have entered the dates of the posted transactions in column a my transactions are out of order which will happen often with pending transactions so now i have to sort them i select columns aj up to posted date then click data sort sheet by column a a z my transactions are now sorted that is pretty much all i do for daily transactions though there are two things i want to make note of paying credit card bills when paying a credit card bill i enter a debit in column e as well as a credit in the corresponding credit card column for instance i paid my citi credit card bill on in the amount of this is what that transaction looks like lookahead often times i will enter transactions that have not happened yet further down the spreadsheet for example if i know i have a credit card bill due later this month or a rent payment or an incoming paycheck i will enter it in order to look ahead of my finances this teaches me discipline in how i am spending my current balance while making sure that i am preparing for upcoming expenses an example of this can be seen in rows i know that i have a credit card bill due on and i also have another paycheck coming on entering both of these transactions allows me to gauge how prepared i am when that time comes at the end of the month i simply rightclick and click duplicate renaming the new spreadsheet to i also make sure that all of the formulas in dj correctly point to the previous month d change k to k f change l to l g change m to m h change n to n i change o to o j change p to p ally savings apy this tab follows the same structure as the monthly tabs stocks owned i use this tab to keep track of the current stocks that i own a enter the stock ticker b enter the purchase date c enter the number of shares purchased d enter the purchase price rows helps me track when i should sell the stock and what my net gainloss would be c enter the number of shares purchased d enter the purchase price the chart will show you what the sell price would be for a gross profit stocks sold this just helps me keep track of my stocks sold over the years i copy and paste the values directly from stocks owned when i choose to sell k this tab tracks all of my k transactions c enter the money contributed for the month d enter the amount of gainloss for the month columns gi will give you the yeartodate statistics but it is pretty barebones at the moment hsa this tab follows the same structure as the monthly tabs hsa investment this tab follows a similar structure as the k tab credit score this tab keeps track of my monthly free credit estimates offered by my credit cards columns hi tracks roughly what date a new credit score is available its interesting to see how your credit score is affected month to month based on various factors for instance my credit utilization was high from due to the holidays and various trips my credit took a dip for that period and then has been slightly rising since thats all she wrote im going to get some shut eye but i hope that this will help at least a few individuals i promise to answer any questions you may have in the morning

availability and additional news articles thread edited pm est added new clarification around the meaning of the arbitration agreement additional evidence on this equifax statement part and part all this thread will serve as the rpersonalfinance official mega thread for discussing the recent equifax security breach rlegaladvice also has a mega thread on this issue if you want to focus on legal options the tldr of that thread is wait to join a class action and do not sue in small claims court summary equifax inc said its systems were struck by a cyberattack that may have affected about million us customers of the credit reporting agencysome uk and canadian residents were also affected canadian thread and uk thread intruders accessed names social security numbers birth dates addresses and drivers license numberscredit card numbers for about consumers were also accessed criminals took advantage of a us website application vulnerability to gain access to certain files from midmay through july of this yearthe intruders also accessed dispute documents with personal identifying information for about consumers the company set up a website wwwequifaxsecuritycom that consumers can use to determine whether their information was compromised its also offering free creditfile monitoring and identifytheft protection the purpose of this sub is not to provide legal advice however per the arbitration clause and class action wavier included in the trustedid premier terms of use applies to the free credit file monitoring and identity theft protection products and not the cybersecurity incident identity theft wiki please see the identity theft wiki for steps to take if your identity has been stolen you may wish to freeze your credit with the different reporting agencies note that their websites are currently under a heavy load and may be unresponsive for more information on what freezing your credit means see the ftcs explanation equifax also recently announced that they are waiving fees for freezing your credit with them it is unclear if they plan to offer refunds to those that paid to do so before today using wwwequifaxsecuritycom a helpful discussion adapted from ulikeasomebodie on using wwwequifaxsecuritycom check to see if you are effected using this link either of the following messages from equifax mean your information was stolen thank you based on the information provided we believe that your personal information may have been impacted by this incident thank you your enrollment date for trustedid premier is xxxxxx please be sure to mark your calendar either of these messages mean that your ssn dob full address and potentially dl number have been stolen assume that information is now public data because if its not out there already someones indexing it right now please note that some media outliets are reporting that these messages are not completely reliable however it still appears that using this site provides at least some information even if it is not completely accurate see the identity theft guide for additional information on freezing your credit next steps etc additional information your credit card company may offer some form of identity theft protectioncredit monitoring you should review the benefits that your card has to see if this applies to you equifax is making credit freezes free for some customers it isnt clear if this extends to everyone or only certain individuals update it should be free to all see the announcement here no word on whether previously paid fees will be refunded but you can call and ask it appears that in some cases the pin you get from equifax when freezing your credit is just a time stamp of when the freeze was initiated if this happened to you consider requesting a new pin by mail some individuals are reporting difficulty obtaining a credit freeze online you may need to submit documents via mail if this is the case there is now at least classaction lawsuit on this issue please keep in mind that per equifaxs most recent financials it has a book value of equity of only about billion dollars on total assets of about billion dollars so it seems unlikely that billion even if awarded could actually be paid urholowczak has put together a handy tree of phone options when calling the major credit bureaus here related linksthreads on this issue

97wkik,personalfinance,2018-08-16 21:55:19,my new rules for lending money so when my husband and i first started trying to take our finances seriously we noticed a particular big leak in our finances lending friends and family money my husband and i have a lot of friends who have for lack of a more gracious term never gotten their shit together since we have been making decent money for years they started getting into the habit of calling us when they got in a financial bind here there there i realized that we very rarely ever saw any of it back i needed to put a stop to this but i still wanted to be able to help my loved ones when needed so i came up with some rules when lending money to loved ones i never loan money if i cant afford to just give it to you then i cant afford to loan it to you it is a gift and i never expect to see it back whether you give it back is completely up to you and were still just as good of friends if you dont i will never let money come between us you only get one gift if you give it back then it is no longer a gift and you are welcome to another gift should you ever need it there is no limit to how many gifts you can receive and return but only one at a time no you cannot receive a gift and then a dayweekmonth later decide you need to add on to that gift ask for everything you expect to need and then even a little more if you like but no adding on more later no means no if you try to guilt me or otherwise manipulate me if i refuse to give you money i will walk away and we will not be friends or speak again until you understand that you just made me feel used and only valuable to you as a wallet i will only forgive this once more than once is a pattern that speaks volumes about what i am to you so far this has gone well both good friends we have given money to under these rules chose to pay us back over time and have not requested a second gift yet i think being able to repay us on completely their own time of their own volition and without any pressure from us made them feel more comfortable and respected weve lost some friends over money before we established these rules im really hoping that this might help plug the financial drain and preserve friendships at the same time if you have any suggestions that could improve this please feel free to post them update wow well i did not expect this to blow up like it has but thats really cool and i appreciate all the activity compliments discussion and the gold from two lovely people im trying to answer any questions directed at me but on mobile this is a lot to shift through so feel free to tag me or whatever if you want me to answer or comment on something thanks everyone for an awesome discussion
7x9hiy,personalfinance,2018-02-13 13:48:24,friendly reminder that theres no harm in asking your credit card company to refund your late fee though its no excuse of course i have been rather busy this past month and recently got sick and forgot to pay my chase credit card bill which meant i ended up with a late fee i just paid today which was about days late and immediately after paying online i called their customer service number funnily enough i didnt even have to ask for her to refund the late fee because she knew right away that that was what i was calling for i remained polite and she refunded it for me i also have the fact that i typically pay the bill on time and this was my first time paying late so if youre a late payer this is probably not the best policy theres no harm in asking

bwwbxu,personalfinance,2019-06-05 00:32:03,theres no such thing as a employee if your employer controls where and how you work and how you get paid youre probably a w employee and not an independent contractor i see quite a few threads on this sub asking about taxes and pay as an independent contractor or employee where the op goes on to say they have a set schedule set work assignments and get paid at regular intervals this is not what an independent contractor is and theres a good chance the worker in question is being misclassified as a contractor when theyre in fact an employee employers misclassify employees as contractors in order to avoid paying payroll taxes like unemployment insurance premiums and the employers share of fica social security and medicare withholdings the misclassified workers also dont get the protection of workers compensation or other employment laws its a rampant problem especially in recent years and any independent contractor should take a careful look at their business relationship there are laws in most states that distinguish a true contractor from an employee and the irs has its own set of standards see in a nutshell being a contractor or employee comes down to how much control the business paying you has over your work and finances if the business youre working for can tell you when where and how to work or has set methodsprocedures youre probably not an independent contractor if your job performance is measured against the businesss standards youre probably not an independent contractor if the business youre working for reimburses your expenses gives you toolsequipment and materials to do your work or pays you by the hour week month etc youre probably not an independent contractor if you only work for one company provide services to them fulltime and do so continuously ie not projectbased work youre probably not an independent contractor if you can quit or be fired at any time without causenotice or financial repercussions ie working atwill youre probably not an independent contractor if you think you might actually be an employee based on factors like these but are getting a misc instead of a w and are being treated as a contractor please report it to your states revenue agency unemployment agency andor labor department you can also file form ss with the irs but the irs is very underfundedunderstaffed right now so you may want to reach out to your states agencies first your state can probably do an audit and then refer the findings to the irs on its own worker misclassification is a huge problem that needs more attention businesses might save on payroll taxes by passing off employees as contractors but the misclassified worker gets all of the tax liability and none of the protections tldr employees get misclassified as independent contractors all the time know the factors and report it if you think somethings amiss

b1zngq,personalfinance,2019-03-17 00:59:01,if your bank calls you even if the phone number is legit dont verify anything call them back first this may also get posted in rtifu as well cause im a dummy got a call today from my bank caller id confirmed saying theyd seen fraud on my atm card telling me the last digits of my atm card at a walmart in florida i live in colorado of course that wouldnt be me and yes i do have the atm card in my possession they never asked for the full card number while they put me on a brief hold to verify something i did a reverse lookup on the phone number it did match my bank they sent me an sms code to verify over the phone the shortcode of the sending number also matched my banks sms shortcode figured everything was legit gave them my home address to ship me my new card they put me back on hold to talk to a manager to waive an additional fee to expedite sending the card but it was not my bank while they put me on that second hold they withdrew almost in small increments at an atm in california again i live in colorado i hung up i called my bank they verified they did not call me had no record of possible fraud in florida but that the six atm withdrawals in california did flag as fraud i happened to record the phone call of the bank calling me so im sending the phone recordings to my actual bank meanwhile i have to wait days to get the back yay thank goodness for things like an emergency fund so the lack of the cash doesnt hurt but still a major nuisance quick edit thanks for the incoming messages about this and the genuine support many have had similar experiences and i posted this as a reminder to all that you should always call your bank yourself to verify anything never verify anything on an incoming call edit for clarification from several comment conversations heres what likely happened they spoofed my banks phone number asked me where i wanted the new atm card shipped thus i verified my mailing address they followed my banks verification playbook and said they were sending me a verification code via sms which i then relayed what was very likely happening on another phone line was they were socialengineering my bank pretending to be me verified my mailing address verified the sms code which i relayed to them and likely changed my atm card pin so they could withdraw cash even down to my bank charging a fee for rushing a new card and waiving the fee in case of fraud this was a very clever social engineering feat also an important note there are tons of apps out there which can record phone calls but the legality of this depends on where you live and the location where the personbusiness on the other end of the call are located one comment has a link to a lawsuit where the second party was not in a onepartyconsent state which makes recording a phone call illegal always tell your caller that youre recording the call i miss being on google voice that could play a message that you were recording the call etc friendly reminder of the day besides drink more water go out and enjoy some sunshine and be nice to one another if someone calls claiming to be your bank never verify any information even if everything like phone numbers and sms seem to match thank them for the alert and tell them that youll call them right back do not provide any information to them

5ob55t,Entrepreneur,2017-01-16 14:38:39,months ago i posted the exact process on how i sold selling tshirt on amazon i will now explain the exact steps you can take to earn your first selling on amazon via the shopify integration with zero inventory a lot of you may recognize me from the post i did a few months ago regarding selling tshirts on amazon and of course a ton of comments making jokes about the t shirt industry since merch by amazon the program i was using in the old post is still on lockdown i am going to show you step by step how to take graphicsdesigns and sell them on amazon on s if not different kind of items by using the new shopify amazon integration combined with print on demand services to fulfill your orders this means you can take action today before any of you get on your pedestal about self promotion yes this did come from the merch informer blog and yes you can do this method i am about to lay out for you without using any tools if you want to learn something continue reading if not continue on with your day lets do it what is merch if you have been reading what i have been posting this last year you may be thinking about merch by amazon where the focus was just tshirts merch however goes a lot more broad than that this can include anything from funny novelty tshirts to flags you hang on your wall to the yoga pants that are worn to the gym and everything in between if you have sold on amazon before or pushed tshirts and realized how many customers you have access to then you know how lucrative it can be shirts are just the tip of the iceberg though if you could start selling beach towels coffee mugs yoga pants flags and any other type of merch without ever seeing or touching inventory on amazon imagine how your earnings would explode overnight why merch as you can see from the image above amazon is doing its very best to capture as much market share as it can that is literally all they care about grow bigger than everyone else at the very end of they opened yet another program to attempt to take over another sector of the market merch by amazon this program was aimed at dominating the print on demand pod niche and it was an overnight success this program allowed everyday people and designers like you and i to put up original artwork and funny says on novelty tshirts and sell them to amazon customers without ever dealing with customer support or touching the actual product amazon sold packaged and shipped your products and gave the designer a royalty earnings from early adopters were absolutely massive and in some cases into the s of thousands of dollars unfortunately amazon did not expect the monster growth of the merch by amazon program and quickly turned it into an invite only program recently they have been processing so many orders that they have completely stopped accepting people to the program and people who do have an account are not allowed to publish or are allowed to publish with restrictions you can see that if you want to make money online by selling apparel you need to be selling on amazon there is really no other way around it by they are going to be absolutely dominating the online market place and you have the chance to be a part of it with merch by amazon closed to the public and not wanting to deal with shipping items from china or dealing with a print shop for every order what can be done fulfillment by amazon is an option but from our experience not a very good good one you would have to buy the products a head of time and send them to a ware house with merch by amazon we clearly know that selling merch hands off is the way to go use shopify to sell your merch many of you reading this are at least familiar with shopify as a content management system and online store payment processor from here you will be able to put your products up for sale and sell them to customers who visit your site with recent changes and shopify integrating with amazon this the way to go why you will have access to not only tshirts but tank tops phone cases beach towels coffee mugs cutting boards stickers long sleeves hoodies dog bowls flags blankets mouse pads shower curtains and much more are you starting to see the big picture here you can take the artwork that you created for shirts or other mediums and turn a single image into s if not hundreds of different products that you will sell on amazoncom no more handling inventory or trying to drive traffic to your store anymore this is going to be a long one so strap in and lets go over step by step on how to set up everything so you are no longer held back by merch limits shopify amazon print on demand method to make this method work for you you are going to need things understand amazon bsr best sellers rank and what sells best on amazon designsartwork amazon seller account shopify account lets go over how i get everything set up and then we will tie them all together understanding what sells on amazon best sellers rank the very first thing you need to do before you start your journey is understand what sells best on amazon how to spot these items and how to properly research the different niches you want to create merch around there are two very key aspects that you need to have a solid understanding of to have any success these are amazon bsr or best sellers rank and the second is understanding copyrighttrademark amazon bsr best sellers rank every single product that is sold on amazon has something in the product information called the best sellers rank or amazon bsr it will look very similar to this the bsr is a representation of how well that item is selling in its respective category the smaller the number the more items they are selling the higher number the fewer items they are selling for example if a shirt were to hit number in clothing it would be the most popular shirt selling on amazon from my experience selling a bsr of around in clothing equates to around sale per day this is not set in stone but k bsr is usually what i focus my sites on when doing niche research copyrighttrademark you also need to have a full understanding that you are not allowed to infringe on someone elses copyright or trademarks this means that you are not allowed to simply copy someones design and put it up on another piece of merchandise doing so would be breaking copyright laws if someone has a particular saying in their artwork that is selling particularly well they might decide to trademark that term this would mean that you are not allowed to use this term in any of your designs even if it looks completely different copyright and trademark are both different beasts so make sure you are not infringing on someone elses intellectual property a lot of times you might put something up on amazon which then gets trademarked later on down the road they can then use this trademark to come after you and the items you put up causing infractions and an entire mess if you have thousands of products up like we do this can be almost impossible to keep track of if you are at all concerned about this make sure you are checking daily getting designsartwork when i first started i created some designs myself since i am not a designer by trade this took a lot of my time up and i had to actually watch some tutorials on youtube to make sure i was using photoshop correctly once i saw just how well my designs were selling on amazon i started to scale up very quickly and this meant getting a designer or on board to start cranking out original designs finding a good designer can be extremely hard you want one that you can count on to be on time every time you also want a designer that has some integrity and will be original when you send them ideas i have managed to hire my entire team of designers at full time for per design each this may just be personal experience but a lot of them from the philippines and this really ads up to a great wage in that part of the world i have found excellent success by using upwork upwork is a marketplace to post jobs you are interested in completing and then hiring freelancers below is the script that i used to hire each one of my designers hey i am in need of tshirt designs in the time period of months your task will be pretty basic i will send you ideas of tshirts i want to make and you make them yourself in your own unique style for example i might send you a link of a already existing tshirt and i would need you to be inspired by it and create a better version that is in your own creative style i will leave a lot of reviews so that you will be able to get jobs easier in the future and this is a longterm position once we have done the first batch of around per day we could continue if everything looks good i look forward to doing business with you this works well for me because i always have a lot of designs for them to do because i am quickly scaling up so they will have some long term work from me it also works well because a lot of very talented people are new to the upwork platform and are trying to build up their profile to find other jobs lots of great reviews from you as a satisfied client can help them in this journey what this means for you is that they are going to put the best effort forward in order to earn those stars quick note weeding out bad designers when i first tried to hire someone to design for me they stole images and straight up copied designs this is wrong and will get your merch account banned i was not able to use any of these designs when i first hired someone i let them know that they cannot use any images which are copyrighted or infringe on any copyright someone else owns then i will send them a tshirt idea that is very clearly copyright infringement if they copy it or do not change it enough to be considered free use i will immediately get rid of that designer and that design the design may have cost me but that is an extremely small price to pay to weed out the copycats amazon seller account the next piece of the puzzle that you are going to need is is an amazon seller account you can sign up for one here this will ask you to sign into your amazon account and if you do not have one already simply sign up for one once you are signed up and logged in there are few things you are going to want to do first you

account is required shopify account getting a shopify account is extremely easy and they have a day free trial head on over to shopifycom and click on the get started box in the upper right hand corner you will then just need to fill out your email address password and the store name you want to create click on the big green create your store button and shopify will start setting itself up connecting shopify and amazon for no inventory fulfillment now that you have a fancy new shopify store for free for the next days it is time to start taking advantage of what it has to offer at first your store will look just like this when you log in in the lower hand corner you will see apps click on this what we are looking for here is an app that will fulfill all your orders for you this is how we are going to print on demand without holding any inventory ourselves search for teelaunch it will bring up the page for this app that looks like this click on the big green get button to install this app you will need to quickly confirm that you want to install it on your shopify store click on install app and let it do its thing once the app is installed go back to the left hand side menu and click on apps again we are about to set up this app and add our first product once you click on the app you should see this dashboard click on the account button in the upper right hand corner we want to make sure everything is set up to auto accept and fulfill orders fill out this page making sure that the top box says yes you will need to add a credit card for the orders that you send teelaunch while you will be paying them the base price for the shirts and other merchandise orders you send them you will be collecting the money from the sales in the amazon central account you will also need to set shopify to not automatically fulfill orders to do this go into your shopify settings checkout and then in the order processing section unselect to automatically fulfill the order items in most cases do not automatically fulfill any of the orders line items will be selected which is the setting you want adding your first piece of merchandise now we are finally ready to add our first piece of merch from the teelaunch app you will want to click on new product on the bar near the top of the page this is where you can see all the products that are available for you to put your designs on not only can you do shirts which is what this entire tutorial is going to go over but as mentioned above there are so many other pieces of merch you can print and send to customers on amazon all without lifting a finger for the products yourself teelaunch will take the orders and ship them for you while you sit back and collect money off the designs and products for this method we are going to be using the gildan unisex shirt as you can see i have chosen that one on the screen once a product is chosen scroll down to the bottom and click on start designing this will bring up the product information and give you a little information about the shipping costs this is also the space where you can upload your artwork to the shirts and pick what sizes and colors you want the shirt to be available in as you can see using this shirt it will cost you as a base price and shipping click on choose file to upload your design and then play around with dragging and dropping it as well as dragging the edges out so it displays properly on the shirt you want to list i just took one of my merch ready shirts to display how it would look pick a few colors and a few sizes important you will need a separate upc code for every single color and size variation you pick i will go into this in detail further down but it is best to not automatically select every color and every size once the design is looking good click on review and publish designs this will bring up a page where you can add product tags add your selling price title and description once you are satisfied with how everything looks go ahead and click on publish at the bottom of the page and your shirt will start processing in all the colors and variations that you have picked this can take a little while if you pick a lot of sizes and colors as you can see from the above picture i have different variants of just this one shirt once it goes through all of them your shirt is now published in the back end of your shopify store the entire point is to publish your goods on amazon though right to do this we need to connect them now go back to the main shopify menu and click on add a sales channel this is brand new from shopify and why i am so excited you can also find the same thing from the home page it will be at the bottom from the screenshot here you can see you need to hit the install amazon button to add this as a sales channel to your site if you are new to shopify you do not need to create an online store since we are interested in only selling your products on amazon using a print on demand service teelaunch once that is installed you should see the sales channel added to the menu go ahead and click on it and it will more than likely ask you to update amazon this is what you want to go ahead and update the sales channel once it is updated you will be able to access the page from here you want to be able to connect shopify to your amazon sellers account we set up earlier click on connect to amazon there is going to be a popup about amazon mws you will need to agree to this essentially this is giving shopify access to your seller central account so they can interact with each other properly once these are connected you will see a screen that looks similar to this you will see that the account is connected properly click on the listings in the left hand corner we want to take the shirt we just put online and then put that shirt we created in teelaunch onto amazon click on the sell on amazon button this will bring up a list of the products that you have on shopify that you may want to sell on amazon since we used teelaunch to create a shirt this is what is going to come up in the list after you select the product that you want to list on amazon they are going to ask you if you are selling a product from another brand or from your own brand select your own brand note for all the merch by amazon users this is your first real opportunity to build a coherent brand and put work into growing your brand on multiple sales channels you have full control here and will even be able to respond to the reviews you get when you pick that the product is made by your brand you are going to come to the amazon listing details this is going to look very familiar to you if you have sold shirts on merch before enter in the title your brand name the bullet points and description you will need to pick a category and will notice that you cannot sell the shirt for both genders at the same time that is perfectly fine you can go back after the shirt is live and then sell the other genders version under the same listing finally when you scroll down you will see variants that you have chosen when you were creating the shirt there will be one for every color and size combo that you created for each variant go through and make sure the correct colored image is showing up for the title of that variant as you can see from the above screenshot i made sure the royal blue image is showing for the royal blue variant of the shirt sku you will need a unique sku for every single varient of your shirt your visitors will never see the sku or the upc but amazon requires you to enter this information in for every shirt variant for the sku head on over to and select the following options and click go you can generate however many strings you need by modifying the first box you can use each line as one of your skus upc each product and variant must have its own upc code these are digit codes if you have sold on amazon fba before you may have used ean so far with the shopify integration these will not work so you will need the digit upc i highly recommend buying these on ebay you can get s of them for only a few dollars once you have them enter a unique upc for every variant of the product clothing and apparel category approval you will notice that shopify tells you that you need approval from amazon before you can list in this category click on the apply to sell in this category link and open it in a new tab make sure you answer truthfully to these but you will be auto approved in the end the next step is going to be answering some questions about the images you will use go through the questionnaire and make sure you answer them all properly remember that the images you will be using are being pulled from teelaunch so they are all good to go with amazons requirements after that is complete fill out the information and submit your application after you hit submit application you will now be instantly approved and can go back to your shirt listing you were working on in the other tab finishing amazon listing now that you have your skus and upcs listed on each variant of the product it is now time to submit your product listing if everything has been entered properly your listing will go through as you can see from the image above the listing has been successfully submitted to amazon your listing should be listed in a pending status this generally will change within minutes to live and you will have a link to your product on amazoncom note on shipping when your product finally goes live and you check it you might notice that the shipping is higher than you expected well you can change this the shipping is all controlled within your amazon seller central account head on over to your amazon account and find the shipping settings and then shipping templates click on edit template and then you will be able to pick what type of shipping you will charge your customers as you can see from the screenshot i decided to change shipping from for everyone to for the lower states roi calculations this is going to vary per shirt depending on what you price at keep in mind that with certain products you may be making a lot larger percentage you might be making roi with yoga mats for example for shirts though if you are pricing at dollars and charging dollars shipping then the total charge will be around with amazon fees around and the tshirt costing you cost of the shirt plus shipping and a c shopify fee this leaves you around profit for something you never touched scale that up by a few hundred if not thousands of shirts you are making great money scale it up even further with the multitude of products you can reuse your designs on and now you are talking about massive money all from your original designs getting your first sale on shopify with amazon now with your listings live you are probably going to get some sales when you get a sale they will show up in shopify as well as seller central make sure you are only dealing with the orders through shopify though getting your first order feels great what is even better though is that from here it is hands off if you go back down to apps and then go into the teelaunch app you should see this without touching it your shirt is now being made with teelaunch and will be shipped to your customer as soon as it is complete this is possible for t shirts and all other products that teelaunch offers fulfilling orders manually if your orders are not automatically going through to teelaunch you will need to do them manually the only reason this may be happening is that the shopifyamazon integration is brand new and i have been assured by higher ups that this is being worked on and will be fixed soon if anyone does encounter it getting revenue from amazon in order to get your money from your seller account on amazon to your bank account you need to have a few things the first thing is that you must have valid credit card information on file for verification and billing purposes this is why you added this when you set up your seller account the second thing you must have is valid bank account information so a transfer can occur this can be added in the my profile section of your seller central account basically the way it will work is that after you get a sale it will show up in your shopify account once the order is marked fulfilled the buyer will be emailed to let them know that their product is on the way the funds held within amazon will be deposited to your account every days the good news is that you can request funds faster than that here is what amazon has to say on the subject wrapping it up the shopifyamazon integration represents a real massive opportunity in the print on demand space and is going to see plenty of people make millions of dollars a year in order to take advantage of this opportunity successfully you need only a few things know what sells on amazon be willing to work and scale your business know how to properly optimize your amazon listings if you are not hopping on this opportunity today you are leaving money on the table that is there for the taking there is zero need to run traffic zero inventory to hold and s if not s of possibilities for making money with the crazy selection of products you can now put for sale on amazon that about raps it up ladies and gentlemen any questions ask

ive built several successful businesses so far why local services frankly there is a ton of money to be made these are huge markets in terms of however unlike regular ecommerce companies where you are competing with the best internet marketing people in the world with local services youre competing with just the people in your neighborhood most of whom do not understand internet marketing at all

someone said i make it sound too easy business is risky anyone that tells you otherwise has never started a business its incredibly difficult subject to fail will make you overweight sitting at a computer will give you high blood pressure and anxiety if youre not careful and it is incredibly difficult to find customers and shoot sometimes even more difficult to have those customers pay you when youre done nothing about business is easy otherwise everybody would be doing it takes an almost insane person to take on trying to make it in the world with their own two hands and take on all the responsibility for the livelihoods of a lot of people just keeping it real this is hard but doable because a ton of people have done it but its not for everyone by any means not everyone is cut out for entrepreneurship to begin with and certainly not everyone is cut out for local services and dealing with human beings good luck if you want additional training on this and be on weekly calls

4wbdcz,Entrepreneur,2016-08-05 16:54:42,seo is not hard a stepbystep seo tutorial for beginners that will get you ranked every single time note this is a chapter out of my growth hacking book called secret sauce the ultimate growth hacking guide this is only one of the chapters that read just like this also the links i posted here are broken but you can view the whole thing beautifully formatted on medium here after my post about making money from an affiliate site was at the top of this sub for a couple days ive received more than pms asking for more info on how seo works and how to get authority sites ranking i have a chapter about that in my book so im just going to publish it for free for what its worth i drive millions of dollars of traffic in the most competitive key terms online including with new sites so if you come in here to comment this wont work youre wrong its hard work but its not unreasonably hard so much so that i decided to call it seo is not hard formatting on reddit is hard so its also on medium here its also one of the several chapters of a book i wrote which you can purchase here seo is not hard a stepbystep seo tutorial for beginners that will get you ranked every single time seo in one day seo is simply not as hard as people pretend like it is you can get of the effort with of the work and you absolutely do not need to hire a professional seo to do it nor will it be hard to start ranking for wellpicked key terms of all the channels well be discussing seo is the one that there is the most misinformation about some of it is subtle but some of it is widely spread and believed by socalled seo consultants who actually dont know what theyre doing seo is very simple and unless youre a very large company its probably not worth hiring somebody else to do its also something that has a lot of faux veneer around it consultants want to make it seem incredibly difficult so that they can charge you a lot but ill show you exactly how to do it step by step and youll win how google works in order to understand what we need to do for seo lets look back at how google started how its evolving today and develop a groundwork from which we can understand how to get ranked on google first were going to reverse engineer what google is doing and then simply follow their rules picking the right keywords and get your sites ranked the early days of google the idea for pagerank googles early ranking algorithm stemmed from einstein larry page and sergei brin were students at stanford and they noticed how often scientific studies referred to famous papers such as the theory of relativity these references acted almost like a vote the more your work was referenced the more important it must be if they downloaded every scientific paper and looked at the references they could theoretically decide which papers were the most important and rank them they realized that because of links the internet could be analyzed and ranked in a similar way except instead of using references they could use links so they set about attempting to download or crawl the entire internet figuring out which sites were linked to the most the sites with the most links were theoretically the best sites and if you did a search for university they could look at the pages that talked about university and rank them google today google works largely the same way today although with much more sophistication and nuance for example not all links carry the same weight a link from an authoritative site as seen by how many links a site has pointing at it is much more valuable than a link from a nonauthoritative site a link from wikipedia is probably worth about links from sites that dont have much authority at the end of the day the purpose of google is to find the best or most popular web page for the words you type into the search bar all this means is we need to make it clear to google what our page is about and then make it clear that were popular if we do that we win in order to do that well follow a very simple process that works every single time with less effort than you probably think is required gaming the system google is a very smart company the sophistication of the algorithms they write is incredible bear in mind that there are currently cars driving themselves around silicon valley powered by googles algorithms if you get too far into the seo rabbit hole youll start stumbling upon spammy ways to attempt to speed up this process automated software like rankerx gsa ser and scraperbox instructions to create spam or spin content linkwheels pbns hacking domains etc some of that stuff works very short term but google is smart and it is getting smarter it gets harder to beat google every day and google gets faster at shutting down spammy sites every day most dont even last a week before everything youve done disappears and your work evaporates thats not the way you should do things instead of internetbased churn and burn well be focusing on building equity in the internet so if you see some highlypaid seo consultant telling you to use software and spun content to generate links or when you see some blackhatter beating the system just know that its not worth it were going to build authority and get traffic fast but were going to do it in a way that doesnt disappear or cripple your site in the future onpage seo the first step in getting our site ready to rank is making it clear to google what our site is about for now were going to focus our home page our landing page on ranking for one keyword that isnt our brand or company name once we do that and get that ranking we can branch out into other keywords and start to dominate the search landscape but for now well stay laser focused keyword research the first thing we need to do is to figure out what that keyword is depending on how popular our site is and how long its been around the level of traffic and difficulty well get from this effort may vary the long tail theres a concept we need to be familiar with known as the long tail if we were to graph popularity of most things with popularity being the y axis and the rank order being the y axis wed get something like a power law graph there are some big hits that get the majority of attention and after a few hits the graph falls sharply the longtail theory says that as we become more diverse as a society the yellow end of the above graph will stretch forever and get taller think of amazon they probably have a few bestselling products but the majority of their retail revenue comes from a wide variety of things that arent bought anywhere nearly as often as their bestselling products similarly if we were to rank the popularity of the songs played in the last years there would be a few hits that would garner the majority of plays and an enormous number of songs that have only a few plays those less popular products and songs are what we call the long tail in seo this matters because at least in the beginning were going to go after long tail keywords very exact intentiondriven keywords with lower competition that we know can win then gradually well work our way to the left our site isnt going to outrank ultracompetitive keywords in the beginning but by being more specific we can start winning very targeted traffic with much less effort the keywords were looking for we will refer to as longtail keywords finding the long tail in order to find our perfect longtail keywords were going to use a combination of four tools all of which are free the process looks like this use ubersuggest keywordshitter and a little bit of brainstorming to come up with some keywords export those keywords to the google keyword planner to estimate traffic level search for those keywords with the seoquake chrome extension installed to analyze the true keyword difficulty dont be intimidated its actually very simple for this example well pretend like we were finding a keyword for this book and well probably have to build out a site so you see if were ranked there in a few months step brainstorming and keyword generating in this step were simply going to identify a few keywords that seem like they might work dont concentrate too much on culling the list at this point as most bad keywords will be automatically eliminated as a part of the process so since this is a book about growth hacking im going to list out a few keywords that would be a good fit growth hacking growth marketing internet marketing growth hacking guide growth hacking book book about growth hacking what is growth hacking growth hacking instructions thats a good enough list to start if you start running out of ideas go ahead and check out keywordshittercom if you plug in one keyword it will start spitting out thousands of variations in just a few minutes try to get a solid list of to start with now well plug each keyword into ubersuggest when i plug the first one growth hacking in i get results clicking view as text will let us copy and paste all of our keywords into a text editor and create an enormous list go through that process with each keyword you came up with now well assume you have keywords if you dont try to start with something more generic and broad as a keyword and youll have that many quickly ideally youll have over step traffic estimating now that we have a pretty good list of keywords our next step is to figure out if they have enough search volume to be worth our while youll likely notice that some are so far down the long tail they wouldnt do much for us for example my growth hacking list came up with internet marketing techniques we probably wont go after that one but instead of guessing we can let google do the work for us this will be our weeding out step google keyword planner the google keyword planner is a tool meant for advertisers but it does give us some rough idea of traffic levels google doesnt make any promise of accuracy so these numbers are likely only directionally correct but theyre enough to get us on the right track youll have to have an adwords account to be able to use the tool but you can create one for free if you havent use adwords in the past once youve logged in select get search volume data and trends paste in your enormous list of keywords and click get search volume once youve done so youll see a lot of graphs and data unfortunately the keyword planner interface is a little bit of a nightmare to work within so instead were going to export our data to excel with the download button and play with it there now what were going to do is decide what traffic we want to go after this varies a bit based on how much authority your site has so lets try to determine how easy it will be for you to rank go to semrushcom and enter your url looking at the total backlinks in the third column as a general rule this may vary based on how old your site is who the links are from etc based on the number of links you have this is the maximum level of difficulty you should go after number of backlinksmaximum difficulty go ahead and sort the data by difficulty and eliminate all of the stuff that is too high for your site dont worry well get those keywords later for now you can simply delete those rows exact match one important thing to note is that google gives us this volume as exact match volume this means that if there is a slight variation of a keyword we will see it if the words are synonyms but not if they are used in a phrase so the traffic will be underestimated from what you would expect overall now with that disclaimer sort the traffic volume highest to lowest and from this data pick out five keywords that seem like a good fit here are mine growth hacking strategies growth hacking techniques growth hacking growth hacking instagram growth hacking twitter mine all look the same but that may not necessarily be the case keyword trends unfortunately the keyword difficulty that google gives us is based on paid search traffic not on natural search traffic first lets use google trends to view the keyword volume and trajectory simultaneously you can enter all of the keywords at the same time and see them graphed against each other for my keywords it looks like this the ones im most excited about are purple and red which are growth hacking techniques and growth hacking twitter now well take a deeper look at what the competition is like for those two keywords manual keyword difficulty analysis in order to analyze how difficult it will be to rank for a certain keyword were going to have to look at the keywords manually one by one thats why we started by finding some longtail keywords and narrowing the list this process gets a lot easier if you download the seoquake chrome extension once youve done that do a google search and youll notice a few changes with seoquake turned on the relevant seo data of each site is displayed below each search result were going to alter what is displayed so in the lefthand sidebar click parameters and set them to the following now when you search youll see something like this seoquake adds a ranking number and the following at the bottom the google index this is how many pages from this base url google has indexed page links the number of pages linking to the exact domain that is ranking according to semrushs index usually very low compared to reality but since well be using this number to compare it wil be somewhat apples to apples url links the number of pages pointing to any page on the base url age the first time the page was indexed by the internet archive traffic a very rough monthly traffic number for the base url looking at these we can try to determine approximately what it would take to overtake the sites in these positions youll notice that the weight of the indicators change not all links are from as good of sources direct page links matter much more than url links etc but if you google around and play with it for a while youll get a pretty good idea of what it takes if you have a brand new site it will take a month or two to start generating the number of links to get to page one if you have an older site with more links it may just be a matter of getting your onpage seo in place generally it will be a mixture of both keep in mind that were going to optimize our page for this exact keyword so we have a bit of an advantage that said if you start to see pages from sites like wikipedia you will know its an uphill battle here are a couple of examples so you can see how you should think through these things starting with growth hacking techniques entrepreneurcom is definitely a big name and growth hacking techniques is in the title explicitly this will be difficult to beat but there are no links in the semrush index that point direct to the page by the way i wonder how hard it would be to write an article for entrepreneurcom i could probably do that and build a few links to that easily even linking to my site in the article yongfookcom have never heard of that site total links not much traffic this one i could pass up it does have quite a bit of age and growth hacking tactics in the title explicitly so that would make it tough but this one is doable to pass up after a while alright so quicksprout is relatively popular a lot of links good age lots of traffic a few links direct to the page but not a ton but the word tactics doesnt even appear here this page isnt optimized for this keyword so i could probably knock it out by being optimized specifically for growth hacking tactics lets jump down a ways to see how hard it would be to get on the front page total pages indexed created in no links in the index even to the root url this ones mine i should be able to frontpage easily so this looks like a good keyword now we just have to get the onpage seo in place and start building a few links note after doing this a few more times i learned that i could probably get austenallredcom toward the top of growth hacking press so i changed the onpage optimization of one of those pages to focus on that keyword and well see how it goes onpage seo now that we have our keyword selected we need to make sure google knows what our site is about this is as simple as making sure the right keywords are in the right places most of this has to do with html tags which make up the structure of a webpage if you dont know html or understand how it works just pass this list to a developer and they should be able to help you here is a simple checklist you can follow to see if your content is optimized onpage seo checklist your keyword is in the title tag ideally at the front or close to the front of the tag your keyword is close to the beginning of the title tag ideally the first words the title tag contains less than the viewable limit of characters optional but recommended your keyword is in the first h tag and your page has an h tag if your page contains additional header tags h h etc your keyword or synonyms are in most of them any images on the page have an alt tag that contain your chosen keyword your keyword is in the meta description and there is a meta description there is at least words of text on the page your keyword appears in the url if not the homepage your keyword appears in the first paragraph of the copy your keyword or synonyms google recognizes them now is used other times throughout the page your keyword density is between and the page contains dofollow links to other pages this just means youre not using nofollow links to every other page the page is original content not taken from another page and dissimilar from other pages on your site if you have all of that in place you should be pretty well set from an onpage perspective youll likely be the bestoptimized page for your chosen keyword unless youre in a very competitive space all we have left now is offpage optimization offpage seo offpage seo is just a fancy way to say links sometimes we call them backlinks but its really the same thing google looks at each link on the web as a weighted vote if you link to something in googles eyes youre saying this is worth checking out the more legit you are the more weight your vote carries link juice seos have a weird way to describe this voting process they call it link juice if an authoritative site well say wikipedia for example links to you theyre passing you link juice but link juice doesnt only work site to site if your homepage is very authoritative and it links off to other pages on your site it passes link juice as well for this reason our link structure becomes very important checking link juice there are a number of tools that let you check how many links are pointing to a site and what the authority of those pages are unfortunately none of them are perfect the only way to know what links are pointing to your site is to have crawled those pages google crawls most popular pages several times per day but they dont want you manipulating them so they update their index pretty slowly that said you can check at least a sample of googles index in the google search console formerly known as webmaster tools once you navigate to your site in the lefthand side select search traffic then links to your site theres a debate raging over whether or not this actually shows you all of the links google knows about im convinced its only a sample but its at least a representative sample to see all of your links click on more under who links to you the most then download this table this again seems to only download a sample of what google knows about you can also select download latest links which provides more recent links than the other option unfortunately this doesnt let us see much a to the value of the links nor does it show us links that have dropped or where those links are from to use those there are a wide variety of tools if you have a budget id go with ahrefscom as they have the biggest index followed by mozs open site explorer most of the data you can get with a free account if not then its slightly cheaper than ahrefs and finally semrush which is free for most purposes we need majesticseo uses a combination of trust flow and citation flow which also works fairly well to give you an idea as to the overall health and number of links pointing to your site all of these use different internal metrics to determine the authority of a link but using them to compare apples to apples can be beneficial link structure html links look something like this a href titlekeywordanchor texta where is the place the link directs you to the title is largely a remnant of time gone by and the linked text think the words that are blue and you click on is called the anchor text in addition to the amount of link juice a page has the relevance of the anchor text matters generally speaking you want to use your keyword as the anchor text for your internal linking whenever possible external linking from other sites shouldnt be very heavily optimized for anchor text if of your links all have the same anchor text google can throw a red flag assuming that youre doing something fishy if youre ever creating links like well show you in the future i only ever use something generic like the site name here or the full url internal structure generally speaking you dont want orphan pages those that arent linked to by other pages nor do you want an overlymessy link structure some say the ideal link structure for a site is something like this thats close but it gets a couple things wrong first youll never have a structure that organized and second in an ideal world every page would link to every other page on its same level this can easily be done with a footer that feels like a sitemap or recommended pages that allows you to specify anchor text and pass link juice freely from page to page unfortunately its impossible to draw such a web without it becoming a mess so youll just have to imagine what that actually looks like we have just one more thing to go over before we start getting those first links pointing to our site robotstxt disavow nofollow and other minutia most of seo at this point is now managing stuff that can go wrong there is a lot of that but well go over what will cover of needs and you can google if theres something really crazy robotstxt almost every site has a page at urlcomrobotstxt even google has one this is just a plain text file that lets you tell search engine crawlers what to crawl and not to crawl most are pretty good about listening except the bingbot which pretty much does whatever it wants no matter what you tell it im mostly kidding if you dont want google to crawl a page maybe its a login page you dont want indexed a landing page etc you can just disallow it in your robotstxt by saying disallow somepage if you add a trailing to it eg disallow somepage it will also disallow all child pages technically you can specify different rules for different bots or user agents but its easiest to start your file with useragent if you dont have a need for separate crawling rules disavow google will penalize spammy sites and unfortunately this causes some bad behavior from bad actors say for example you wanted to take out a competitor you could send a bunch of obviously spammy links to their site and get them penalized this is called negative seo and is something that happens often in highly contested keywords google generally tries to pretend like it doesnt happen in the case that this does happen however you can disavow links in the search console which is pretty much saying hey google dont count this one i hope youll never have to use it but if you hire or have hired a bad seo or are being attacked by a competitor that is how you combat it nofollow a link can have a property called nofollow such as this a href titlekeyword relnofollowanchor texta if you want to link to somebody but you dont want it to count as a vote you dont want to pass linkjuice or you support usergenerated content and want to deter spammers you can use a nofollow link google says it discounts the value of those links im not convinced they discount them heavily but other seos are so they seem to deter spammers if nothing else redirects if youre going to change a url but you dont want its link juice to disappear you can use a redirect a will pass a majority of the link juice importantly google views wwwaustenallredcom and austenallredcom as different sites so decide on one and redirect all of one type to the other canonical urls if you have two pages that are virtually the same you can add something like link relcanonical href to say hey treat this page as if it were that page instead but i dont want to it and with that were ready to build our first links link building link building is where seo really starts to matter and where a lot of people end up in a world of hurt the best way to build links is to not build links ive worked for companies in the past that dont have to ask for them they just flow in from press customer blogs their awesome blog posts etc if this is an option and well go over a couple of ways to make it more likely youre in a great place if not at least in the beginning were going to manually create just a few were going to create them in legitimate ways and not hire somebody in india to do so that is a recipe for disaster and i cant even count the number of times ive seen that take down a site web s the easiest way to build high quality links are what seos call web s thats just a way to say social sites or sites that let you post stuff now tweeting a link into the abyss wont do you anything but profiles status pages etc do carry some weight and if they come from a popular domain that counts as a link some of the easiest are twitter in your bio github the readme of a repo youtube the description of a video it has to actually get views wordpress yes youll have to actually create a blog blogger same here tumblr upvotebased sites hackernews growthhackers inboundorg reddit etc if nothing else you can start there and get a half dozen to a dozen links there are always big lists of web s you can find online but keep in mind if youre going to build something out on a blogging platform youre going to have to really build something out thats a lot of content and time but you have to do it the right way we generally keep a bigger list of web s here some may be out of date but you should probably only build a half dozen to a dozen web s anyway expired domains another way to get link juice is by purchasing an expired domain this is more difficult to do but there are a lot of options such as expireddomainsnet google expired domains and youll find dozens of sites monitoring them youll want to purchase a domain that has expired and restore it as closely as you can to its original form using an archive these sites likely have some link juice to pass on and you can pass it to yourself link intersection another way to find places you can build links is by using a link intersection tool these find sites that link to competitor a and competitor b but not to you theoretically if they link to both of your competitors they should be willing to link to you moz ahrefs lunametrics and others have link intersection tools that work quite well now that we have a few basic links flowing were going to work on some strategies that will send continual links and press eventually getting to a point where we dont have to build any more links your first drip of traffic becoming an authority site awesome you have a site that converts well your seo is in place ready for you to drive traffic now what as youre probably learned at this point a site that converts very well but has no traffic flowing to it still converts zero traffic were going to fix that this section takes a lot of time and effort and in the beginning youll likely wonder if youre doing anything at all remember that class in college that is so difficult its the point where most people give up effectively weeding out the people who arent ready to major in a specific subject well this is the weederout chapter of growth hacking take a longterm view the reason so many people stumble on this step is the same reason people stumble on so many steps that take a little effort under time losing weight investing in a k etc in the beginning youre going to have a little seedling of traffic and youll be looking up to those who have giant oak trees thinking i must be doing something wrong youre not doing anything wrong the traffic starts as a trickle before it becomes a flood but dont worry if youre a startup our goal is to get enough traffic that continuing to do this effort will be sustainable meaning we wont die before we start to see the rewards but at the same time were building equity in the internet the type of traffic we want to build is the type that will compound and will never go away we want to create traffic today that will still give us a little trickle in five years combining hundreds or thousands of little trickles our site that converts and a great product we will create a giant river future chapters will go into depth on the networks we need to drive traffic from so in this chapter were going to focus on traffic thats networkagnostic traffic that we cant get by tapping any specific network just to give you some idea of scale ive seen this process drive over visits per day though the build up to that level took almost a full year what could you do with visits per day monitoring alerts to start were going to use the keywords we found in the seo chapter and inject ourselves and our company into the conversation wherever its taking place to do this were going to use software called buzzbundle buzzbundle this software lets us do a few things constantly monitor all mentions of a specific topic competitor or keyword across multiple locations on the internet from facebook groups to quora questions to blog posts where comments are available allow us to leave a constructive comment that references our product or company disclaimer this is not the seo comment spam youve seen this step takes thought effort and a real human who understands what theyre typing i dont often say this but you cannot effectively automate this step without it becoming spammy if youre trying to replicate the automated seo spam youve seen on various blogs and sites this will probably work but youll get banned your clickthrough will be a fraction of what it could be and youll be banned productive commenting were not going to fire up some awful software to drop spun mentions of garbage onto various comment sections online hoping that brings us seo traffic our comments must do two things be contextual we are only going to talk about the topic presented in an article or tweet and only mention our company when it naturally fits in contribute to the conversation i should learn something or have value added to my life by reading your comment if you do these two things a few changes will take place first youll notice that people click on your links because youre a thoughtful person who likes to contribute second people will respect your company because youre a thoughtful person who likes to contribute and with that disclaimer well move on to the nitty gritty of how this is done lets fire up buzzbundle and get to work accounts and personas the first thing youll want to do in buzzbundle is go to accounts add new accounts this is the starting point for everything well do as we need accounts to comment one thing youll notice about buzzbundle is that it lets you use multiple accounts i find it beneficial to think from multiple perspectives and therefore multiple points of view but i dont want to go too far overboard and be spammy id recommend doing something simple create personas each of whom you identify with or are you and enter them into your buzzbundle accounts personally i dont even change my name i just use a different one eg austen j allred vs austen allred or use a few photos just so it isnt literally the same name and same photo blanketing the internet disqus disqus is a comment system used all over the place and it carries some caveates disqus will ban you if you use the same link in every post so there are two workarounds use a lot of different accounts rotating ips or using a proxy every two days or so use your site url as your display name both of these work but the second one is much easier in my view utm parameters using links with our utm parameters here will be very beneficial well be able to track traffic back to each individual blog or site and if necessary double down on the ones that are driving traffic link shorteners if you ever start to run into problems with getting your link posted it may be useful to use a few link shorteners or some redirects to keep it simple you can use a link shortener that s such as bitly or if you want to spend a little more time you can set up your own site and the traffic from a certain page to your money site using buzzbundle lets get started with the buzzbundle first its going to ask you for a keyword we already have a keyword from the seo section but we may want to do something even a bit more generic for this one im going to go with growth hacking simply hit go and let buzzbundle get started it will load different content types into different columns but generally we are going to be scrolling through until we find something that looks compelling and like we can actually contribute to the first thing i clicked on was this its a review of another book about growth hacking all i had to do was comment tag the author ask him if he were willing to review our book and offer to send him one for free if youre that person reading this now its going to be pretty awkward my assumption is this person will find the conversation to be completely authentic because it is when youre authentically reaching out to people you get rid of all of the ickyickythe fact that theres now a link on his video that people who are searching for something else will find is just an added bonus as an aside i much prefer to hold shift and click on a link to open it in my normal browser if im just going to be commenting as myself the next one i found was a roundup of great growth hacking blog posts from the week i left the following comment note how i followed him on twitter so that its obviously personal and not an automated spam comment i even went a little bit overboard and tweeted at him just for kicks that is how you get people on your team as you get further along and have an idea of how to get a good response id recommend starting to sort by reach ramping up the number of keywords youre searching for and possibly even gasp upgrading to the paid version of buzzbundle

x3ehfg,Entrepreneur,2022-09-01 18:13:14,i currently run four successful online businesses i am very frustrated about all the generic advice and bullshit courses out there heres the only advice you need this is aimed at younger folks and those just getting started in entrepreneurship particularly in tech all over tiktok and reddit people keep throwing around all this useless advice to become successful wake up earlier read more books etc courses about getting an entrepreneurs mindset that you have to hustle and work hard all of that is bullshit those attributes will not make you successful i mean dont get me wrongits good to organize your life but speaking as someone who founded four successful online businesses and works in a vc firm these trendy pieces of advice are all platitudes the best piece of actionable advice i can give based on founding four successful businesses and working with other successful firms is this pick and industry or niche and master it this is a huge prerequisite thats not emphasized enough identify the industry or niche you want to enter as specifically as possible and become a master in it learn everything you can buy products from your future competitors understand the pain points that consumers in this industry face do market research figure out which keyword combinations to target learn about the technical attributes the most successful businesses ive worked with all follow the same trend they were formed by people who used to work in a specific industry as employees working for a company they accumulated significant industryspecific knowledge and understood pain points then they started their own business in this industry targeting those pain points target an intersection of two industries or niches what happens if you cant pick which industry or niche to enter or what if your selected industry is too competitive do this list what youre good at or what youre interested in these can be as random as youd like then pinpoint a viable intersection between two listed interests or skills for example lets say you can build websites relatively well youre also interested in cars as were all aware the web design industry is extremely competitive and what do cars have to do with web design instead of entering the web design field enter the web design field targeting automotive dealers and mechanic shops build a few fake demo websites for auto mechanics and then cold call auto mechanic shops with poor websites and offer them their services capture the vertical time and time again ive seen this trend person works for a corporation in a specific industry person accumulates knowledge about said industry person leaves the company and starts his own small business targeting a pain point that their former employer was unwilling to target
1gjap3l,Entrepreneur,2024-11-04 09:55:43,how i made k in a month with a simple python script and nicotine pouches so this is one of those dumb ideas that somehow worked out way better than expected i live in a country where nicotine pouches werent sold until recently a company opened up selling them and people were losing their minds over it they would put new stock on their website at random times and every day it would sell out within minutes if you werent fast you missed out i was actually using these pouches myself and getting tired of missing the drops so i wrote a simple python script that would monitor the website for stock updates and send me a telegram notification the moment they were available worked like a charmi never ran out of pouches again then i thought why not share this with others i moved the notifications to twitter and every time stock became available my bot would tweet about it people went nuts for it the twitter account blew up gaining followers in just two weeks at that point i figured it was time to monetize this thing i stopped the free twitter notifications and posted an announcement if you still wanted to get notified youd have to subscribe to my telegram bot for one month or for three months and believe it or not i made over k in about a month and a half unfortunately or maybe fortunately for the consumers the company eventually ramped up production and nicotine pouches became available all the time so the hype died down it was shortlived but i made some solid money with just a basic python script and some simple market timing

aylx5g,Entrepreneur,2019-03-08 04:06:45,how i made k in a day pretending to own a valet company wasnt sure if this should go on rconfessions or here but figured id share years ago i was bored at work tech sales and was browsing craigslist for services needed and came across a post about needing a valet company for a private party i thought to myself i could do that so i replied and said i had a valet company i did not know the first thing about valet companies and soon after i was heading to their house to have a meeting about logistics it was a huge house in a very wealthy neighborhood m house and this very nice husband and wife greeted me and said they were planning a graduation party for their son and parking was limited house on a hill and would need valet i asked how many cars were expected where we could park times etc and said id check with my team and get right back to them i then called a few valet companies and told them i was a party planner for a wealthy family and needed a valet service i explained that i would be their main point of contact and to please ask their staff not to speak to the owner i provided the details and decided on the one that had the most reasonable prices and seemed legit had insurance etc and they sent me an invoice the total for this service was for hours and guys so i created my own invoice fake letter head etc for i sent it to the client and had no idea how they would respond to the price and not a few minutes later he said perfect and i was stoked i took a deposit personal check made out to me to pay the valet deposit etc the day of the event was stressful the owner of the house thought i owned this valet company and the valet company thought i was a party planner i kept going between the two to make sure that the right hand never talked to the left at one point the actual owner of the valet company stopped by and i told him his guys were rockstars and got him out of there as quickly as possible the event was a huge success the valet guys were awesome to hang out with i basically just hung out ran a few cars myself and gave them all the tips the plan was executed perfectly after the event i came back to get my check and the wife had made me a huuuge goodie bag of food from the party indian familu and indian food id never had before was amazing told me how great we did and all the compliments from their guests etc after that day i did a lot of research on valet companies the market the margins and almost started a business but ultimately decided not to pursue it anyways thats how you make k in a day always remember kids there is money to be made a million different ways if you get a little creative and put your mind to it my only regret looking back at this picture of his house i should have told him i also owned a roofing company pic here valet for a day edit wow crazy amount of comments and positivity as a new member here this is sweet one point of clarity for fake invoice i didnt mimic the valet company or pretend to be another company not even sure why i used the word fake it was a real invoice i dont have a copy at this point but it likely said letterhead my name valet services date event services valetparking hours startend total cost of service deposit thank you if that is considered fraud then color me igloo

5vtkwo,Entrepreneur,2017-02-23 22:24:04,for years i have been ranking ecommerce stores on google some from nothing to here is the exact process on how to start an ecommerce store with zero experience and get it profitable with google traffic with the latest amazon affiliate changes we might have a lot of people switching over from affiliate marketing to ecommerce so i figured id share years of experience building starting and growing ecommerce stores on google ive seen it all computer stores fashion stores health supplement stores gourmet food jewellery sunglasses tape sex toys guitar stores drone stores recreational vehicles paintball stores water filtration home appliances and more obligatory proof even though i frequently work with mmyear ecommerce sites i really enjoy the startup phase theres something really exciting about starting a new ecommerce store so thats what im going to focus on today here are some of examples of the ecommerce ranking technique im going to share sometimes doubling even tripling in google traffic brand new ecommerce startup proof example another new ecommerce store example this ecommerce that could never rank no matter what they tried triples their traffic in less than months and another client example another example of an ecommerce store dramatically increasing their traffic these techniques are unique to ecommerce stores so those pesky bloggers cant use these and provide long lasting results so how do you get google to notice your store and send you massive amounts of visitors lets start with the most common one my least favorite but i want to include it because it works heck many reddit success stories have followed this exact strategy i believe most people should at least try this one first and then more on the others if it doesnt span out the grand slam technique the grand slam technique involves doing something big to get a lot attention its the explosive plan it for three weeks and hope it works out approach essentially this is how you want to do it if you want to follow google recommendation of create great content and people will come and have a chance of succeeding the go big method often involves a marketing stunt with the aim of going viral or a large piece of content you invest several weeks and create something that you believe will capture the worlds attention using your product for example your ecommerce store sells tape to demonstrate the strength of your tape you decide to shoot a video in which you lift a car with your product you spend weeks putting it together coordinating a crane to lift the car a camera crew and a boatload of tape does the video go viral well maybe but then again maybe not statistically it doesnt most things dont go viral there are just too many other cool things happening in the world however you only need one hit to make it dollarshaveclub anyone thats why i prefer the perfect perk technique this technique works so well that google has recently decided that you probably shouldnt do it because it will give you an unfair advantage over the competition there is a weakness in their algorithm and as youll soon see its practically impossible for them to stop it it isnt as sexy as directing your own minicommercial but it does deliver massive amounts of google traffic plus if you want to be a director you can do that with the profits from this approach even if you know nothing about search engine optimization and youre in a competitive industry this is for you instead of relying on what other people think of our blog post or video were going to give google exactly what it wants and in turn it will give us exactly what we want traffic the first step is convincing google that you have the best store in your industry so when someone asks google where do i get this widget google answers right here at your store so what are the main things that google looks for good product listings a ton of people talking about your products convince google that you have these two elements and youre golden however before i get to the sexy stuff getting people to talk about your product using the perfect perk technique i feel id be doing you a disservice if i didnt at least mention what makes a good product listing without this everything else you do is useless so what makes a good product listing i want to tell you a little secret that will make a lot of ecommerce gurus cringe you dont need to do that much for product listings in order to rank on google in fact as long as you convey the right signals youll rank just fine why because all you need is a slightly better product listing than your competition and the truth is most ecommerce stores have no idea what they are doing they use the same stock photography that their supplier sent them they copy paste the word description from the wholesale catalog and then call it a day in the restaurant industry thats the equivalent of reheating frozen food in the microwave it just wont cut it so what does google want at a bare minimum it wants an original picture of your product and an original description this can be as quick as taking a snapshot of the image with your iphone and writing the basics about the item youre trying to sell main feature specifications what is it made of how do you use it what kind of warranty does it have preemptively answering the questions that your customer might have about your product will help you rank higher on google and help you sell more if you want to get fancy have pictures of your product taken by a professional photographer here are examples of great product listing i annotated the product listing examples to highlight the elements that contribute to great rankings for each website great product listing example boom by cindy joseph they combines all the proper seo elements with all the best conversion elements there is a massive amount of social proof on the page which increases conversions here are the highlights multiple original images taken by a professional photographer multiple original videos they also count as unique content original description in the form of benefits huge amount of reviews reviews count as content great product listing example safety tape by creative safety supply they produce extremely useful product pages including many visual elements and additional resources that are useful to the user some of the highlights massive amount of original professional images breadcrumb navigation this helps the clickthroughrate of your google search result listing by adding categories in the results extensive original description multiple reviews not shown in the picture related resources and guides great product listing example levi jeans by amazon why does amazon rank for nearly everything three reasons content content and more content and b backlinks doesnt hurt either some of the highlights multiple original images extensive related amount of products images and information reviews over reviews creates a massive amount of original content that cannot be found anywhere else to google pictures count as content if you take pages and everything else is equal and one with more content wins every time if you want other people to complete your content then allow reviews to be posted on the site and let your customers ask answer questions this will count towards your original content this is one of the main reasons amazon does so well in the search results and now the fun part how to get links to an ecommerce store how does an ecommerce store get backlinks when the competition refuses to link to you related industry sites are too busy writing about the manufacturers instead of linking to the store selling the product no one really knows you you could take the first approach which is to build something and hope it goes viral however i prefer to exploit the weaknesses in googles algorithm by manufacturing real high quality links on related industry sites this method produces better results anyway however before i share this method with you its important that you understand one important element about traffic the misconception that holds most people back the biggest misconception that people have about organic google traffic is that its free and therefore all linkbuilding efforts must also be free instead you will need a small investment as soon as you adopt the mentality that youll invest x into link building with the objective of making y youll be on your way to success if you invest into link building and you make profit you win if you invest and make profit you win even more one mistake many new ecommerce owners make is competing for rankings with a budget of while their competitors are spending my last seo test project cost and has generated at the time of writing over in profits its all about getting a positive return on investment when you adopt the mentality that time money and that money traffic you can make much better decisions with your investments this will change your focus from the cheapest option which wont work to the best value option which will provide you with the highest return on investment the first and often most cost efficient way of acquiring new links when launching a new ecommerce store is drum roll the goodold fashioned press release before you jump off the page thinking oh ive heard this one before i tried a press release and it didnt do anything remember our new mentality we dont want cheap we want good value heres what you should avoid instead of getting a press release that promises to get you good rankings and into news agencies and into google news spring for a professional press release that will get you in front of real journalists that will write articles about you and quite frankly those cost more do you think journalists are reading all the crapola that comes from the press release services journalists are looking for real stories about real businesses those stories tend to be mentioned on larger news sites such as prnewswire marketwired and businesswire so submit your highquality releases to these sites when you submit your first press release about your ecommerce store you want to go in with a purpose how does your store differentiate itself why do you exist why are you better than the competition if you want your press release to succeed two things must happen you must write a good headline and get it in front of the right journalists use a premium press release services to get your headline it in front of the right journalists if youre ever going to have a sale or a promo now is the time i dont have time to cover the dos and donts of a successful press release thats for another article but if youre ever in a pickle you can hire a marketing expert to find an interesting angle for you just remember when you write the press release you arent writing it for customers but for journalists one single press release can land you thousands of high quality links that can power your site for years to come which makes it the best investment a new ecommerce store can make traffic from a well crafted press release a good press release got into the hands of a few journalists sending thousands of visitors to my clients ecommerce store and generating dozens of da links on industry related sites dont use a keyword for your anchor text when creating a press release use your brand name or a generic url this improves the chances of your press release being taken seriously by journalists and prevent potential overoptimization penalties the truth is google doesnt want you to exploit this weakness in their algorithm they tried good press releases will provide massive seo benefits and there is little they can do about it hypothetical situation press release hours of work x for potentially thousands of journalist seeing and writing about your store worst case scenario you get featured on the standard boilerplate sites which will give you some backlink juice and get google traffic flowing bestcase scenario a journalist picks up your story writes a real article about you on a major site which immediately drives traffic sales and skyrockets your google rankings in one shot some multimillion dollar businesses such as the have been made on the back of a single news article when that happens many smaller websites borrow the story and rewrite it as their own further accumulating natural links for your website an unlimited source of recommendations about your product and store every industry has two main categories of websites the sellers this is the ecommerce stores the suppliers and manufacturers the reviewersenthusiastsnews the influencers these are the large blogs and large authority sites that write on a daily basis about the industry they typically carry a lot of weight its your job as a seller to get all the influencers to recommend you when google detects that many influencers are linking to you your store climbs up the google ranks and generate massive amounts of traffic and sales heres why this is a weakness in googles algorithm google doesnt know if the influencers are linking to you because youre a friend because they think you have a good product or because you met them at a conference and promised them a perk in other words as long as the influencers arent advertising give me stuff and ill link to you no one knows why an influencer links to anything and getting influencers to write about us is exactly what were going to exploit however heres where most people get it wrong most sellers approach influencers with the me me me mentality in other words they are only thinking of what they want instead of what the influencer wants the typical email that will get you nowhere as a seller is hey i just launched this store we have amazing products and i thought youd want to let your audience know about us no no and no remember when i said that you have to think of google traffic as an investment and that the focus is getting the best return on investment well that translates to figuring out what the influencer wants for instance most influencers will gladly accept money even though the official google rule is to add nofollow to the links this is rarely enforced by the bloggers the sites you want to avoid are sites that are dedicated to only posting sponsored posts those sites typically serve low quality content the best sites are the ones with an active community and visitors an easy tell is to check to see if there are any comments on the articles good sites tend to have comments on each article influencers make their living from this kind of stuff so they are always on the lookout for good opportunities focus on the influencers needs and start the conversation with hey i just launched this store and was wondering how much it would cost to have you mention my store in your next article will get you a much higher success rate from there i recommend looking up the site metrics traffic how powerful it is and then you can easily calculate the cost to see if its worth it mention from influencer with a da website daily visitors mention from influencer with a da website daily visitors mention from influencer with a da website daily visitors ummm influencer seems overpriced and influencer is providing some good value for the money quick simple repeatable and if its not worth it negotiate you can typically negotiate at least off whatever price they initially throw at you the best negotiation tactic is to present quotes from competitive influencers this will help you get the absolute best price for your post here is an actual conversation i had with an influencer once you have more experience youll be able to guesstimate the amount of traffic ranking boost that such a website can provide over the course of a year the math that link from a da website might result in an extra visitors over the course of a year at a conversion thats extra sales and at an average of profit on each sale thats in profit not bad for a link you might be looking at this thinking damn how do i know what kind of profit ill generate from a link well the truth is you dont however as you gain experience in your industry and youll be able estimate the traffic a bit better in my experience even bad estimates are better than no estimates at all this is how you start building a solid foundation of influencers linking to your ecommerce store however i saved the best for last remember that example where the influencer requested well imagine you could get the same result for a fraction of the price typically sponsored posts and advertorials tend to be pricey they might still be worth it but theres a way to get influencers to respond for much cheaper providing you with a higher roi nearly every influencer in your industry will be interested in your products the best part is that you pay wholesale for your products but the perceived value is much higher influencers love products thats why they got into their industry in the first place and they need products to review in fact nearly every influencer has a section dedicated to reviews on their website so while a highprofile influencer might charge an exorbitant amount of money for a sponsored story about your ecommerce store he or she will gladly accept to review your product if you just send it over to them this works so well that google is freaking out trying to figure out how to reduce the amount of influencers receiving free products and not disclosing it the weakness that were exploiting is the following unless the influencer states that the product was sent to them or they openly advertise that theyll give you a link if you send them a product google doesnt know how the product got to the influencer the only way for google to stop this is to manually check sites openly admitting they are receive sponsored products in exchange for coverage the perfect perk for instance i ran into a fashion blogger who wanted for a sponsored post but but after a bit of talking we concluded that she would write a post about the ecommerce store in exchange for a leather handbag valued at were a store we dont pay full price for our items we only sell our products at full price that handbag had a wholesale price of which means we get to be featured on a giant industry site for instead of the standard now were talking heres how it went down wholesale handbag cost shipping time hour total cost for a da link on a related industry site it gets even better the review is all about our product that means that if out of the thousands of readers who read it a single person buys because of the recommendation weve already made our money back essentially the link costs us absolutely nothing and we get to benefit from increase in google traffic for years to come heres what happened profit made from sales from the article we sold at profit each yearly increase in traffic approximately extra visitors additional sales from extra traffic conversion sales average profit from each sale long term profit immediate profit investment which means that weve made in profit from our handbag investment and thats how you grow your traffic on a brand new ecommerce store making money as you move forward the best part when major influencers start featuring your store and products other influencers will follow soon youll have influencers contacting you requesting samples practically begging to write about you from there just rinse and repeat as long as you want and watch your traffic and sales grow cheers reddit edit because im getting a lot of pm questions about this everyones really nice thanks heres my facebook page if you want to stay up to date and this is where i coach help people however registration for traffic research is closed at the moment i can only support so many people at a time edit post back up thanks

this subreddit unfortunately most of the content here doesnt represent true entrepreneurs but rather wantrepreneurs that think you need a crazy idea to make it you have too many great ideas and cant focus how you make a tonne of cash without working hard in this post i am just going to lay out some home truths in the hope that maybe one person may not waste their hard earned money on a silly idea or perhaps stop daydreaming and start doing xb entrepreneurship is not about big ideas there are m employer firms in the usa thats at least m entrepreneurs in the usa most of these entrepreneurs have businesses in existing industries people today have been poisoned by click bait regarding geniuses like mr zuck or page brin who have dominated their fields and created wealth beyond anyones wildest dreams yet their ideas werent original google wasnt the first search engine it wasnt the second not even the third successful business is all about execution a great team with a dull and mundane product are so much more likely to get succeess than a college grad with a big dream if you feel that being an entrepreneur requires a big idea you are a wantrepreneur if you carry a notebook with all yout great ideas you are a wantrepreneur if you have so many great ideas but just lack focus also known as as the ability to execute well you are a wantrepreneur every headhunter that starts their own headhunting firm is an entrepreneur and they arent doing anything massively different they just back themselves to execute better lawyers who make their own practices are entrepreneurs you dont need to create the next automated legal subscription service to be an entrepreneur either learn a business get great save up and then launch a slightly differentiated business or focus on looking for problems in the job you currently are doing stop dreaming start executing xb successful entrepreneurs spend more time empowering others to build their business a lot of people lurking around this sub seem to relish the idea of bring their big idea to life i have news for you this process is maybe months of your business the rest is incremental improvements and empowering others to grow your business further maybe you are working in a job and dreaming via this sub is a way to keep you sane but remember when you have people working for you you have people potentially thinking of ways to move to the next thing who doesnt want to be a tech millionaire remember you probably think you are underpaid and underappreciated but every person you employ will think similar even if you have the experience drive and ingenuity to build the beginnings of a business you can only grow it so much before you need to rely on others if you cannot empower those people you will not execute and you will not succeed a manager who knows how to empower and excite their subordinates is so much more value than someone who wants to create strategy all the time if you dont have this skill yet you will need a cofounder does or you will need to get more corporate experience xb businesses arent built for you many posts on this sub talk are variants of get rich quick schemes or figuring out how to side hustle at the heart of it many wantrepreneurs think that working for themselves will bring immense freedom and untold riches when you employ people you are responsible for the livelihoods of people you are priority vs your staff businesses need people and people need to believe that their fearless leader can make great outcomes for them think about that for a second are you mature enough to be responsible for families rent or mortgage do you realize that a silly decision on your side could actually create financial hardship for others if your business is not built to make your employees lives better your great employees will churn out and your business and you will not succeed when you look at your spreadsheet imaginging the m net income from your online bowtie emporium just remember those staff numbers will become real people be prepared to look after them managing your staff well is worth x that zany crazy idea soz xb why do you want to be an entrepreneur i think that by now i can call myself a successful entrepreneur and while i am a wealthy human on paper i am grinding and saving like everyone else in fact my sister who is a few years younger than me and who works in law earns triple what i do whilst complaining that she doesnt have the work freedom if you just want to be wealthy without the hassle of all the above try your best to get into those premier industries and make a career out of it if you arent fortunate enough to be able to move into law medicine finance etc then excel at what you are currently doing and then do exactly the same thing yourself xb i think that is enough of a rant dreaming is great because the thought of being successful can fill that emotional void but unfortunately it isnt real furthermore if you think that being an entrepreneur means being the next zuck or equivalent you are essentially trying to replicate of successful entrepreneurs as opposed to the unsung business owners out there good luck to all
vqr0hm,Entrepreneur,2022-07-03 21:02:27,from kmo to kmo in months selling backpacks ill save you the long form word vomit and just get to the bullet points so you can see what worked for us and replicate it in your own business if you sell even half decent physical goods you can follow this exact formula get comparable results alright the company sells travel backpacks targeted at photographers videographers product primarily used to store and transport camera gear film equipment in january the store hit k in monthly revenue purely from the owners efforts of posting in online communities making videos on a youtube channel google search ads running facebook ads on a low daily spend that would crap out if he tried scaling beyond day here is how we took the store to kmo just months later mass outreach via emails cold dm to nano micro influencers in photography niche on tiktok instagram youtube we offered them free product in exchange for content a mention if they truly like the product the messaging tone used during outreach will determine your open rates responses less is more if a creator didnt opt for the free product alone but was responsive interested in collaborating we offered budgetfriendly paid sponsorship that was not supposed to look or feel like a sponsorship the payment depended on the creators content quality audience size engagement rate all collaborations were contentoriented they had to be entertaining engaging educational with no emphasis on driving sales pushing discounts or artificial scarcity just make stuff your audience will watch enjoy this approach works especially well with tiktok right now since good content can gain traction organically example one of the creators we hired does wildlife photography documents the behindthescenes on his tiktok he brought the backpack along for one of his trips and was just honest about it and how it was sent to him gave a genuine review where he listed the pros just one minor con which the owner has since fixed we were netting an average x return on these influencer collaborations we calculated this via attributed revenue divided by cost of goods gifted plus payments to influencers heres where things got very interesting we got permissions from all creators to use their content for commercial purposes advertising etc all of the content we were receiving was sent to our video editors to be cut up reordered into different sequences overlayed with a voiceover turned into ad creatives the secret to paid advertising is lots of creative variations multivariate testing and focusing on platforms where you can really excel and go all in most figure brands ive worked with started with offer on platform many still run that among other campaigns to this day if it aint broke dont fix it you also have to adapt your ad creative to the placement platform what works on tiktok may not translate well to facebook and vice versa for tiktok ig reel placements we write a voiceover script and try to tell stories involving the product this is the format users trust engage with at this point in our journey the company that couldnt spend day on ads profitably was now spending day at x roas what changed the quality of the creative and the amount of creative tests launched more volume more rolls of the dice more chances of outliers that outperform everything else prior to seriously scaling ads we wanted to ensure the backend was optimized two key areas to focus on are cvo customer value optimization and cro conversion rate optimization cvo optimizations that worked well to anyone who didnt take the prepurchase upsell on the product page we offered it at a discount postpurchase we also offered a nd identical backpack postpurchase at a deep discount so your travel partner doesnt feel left out surprisingly we had a take rate which was insane since its not a cheap product split test your upsells for maximum aov outside of that we rewrote the email sequences to better reactivate customers but were limited in what we can do to increase ltv until the owner launches new products cro optimizations that worked well we wrote designed a new dedicated landing page for cold traffic took away walls of text bloat and replaced it with visual content we added in a bold branded guarantee that was specific to the product and instilled confidence were so sure youll love this well do blank blank blank we also filtered reviews to prioritize the most contentrich contextrich reviews personal stories experiences showcased via videos photos reviews that site visitors feel represented by and can relate to most importantly we also added in a faq section on the bottom and took inspiration for common questions from competitors sites amazon listings of similar products below the faq we added another strong call to action all of this effort took the conversion rate from to to the same traffic source controlled experiment we were finally ready to start cranking up the heat and begin scaling we started pushing through more advertising spend and increasing budgets daily until we started to hit resistance and diminishing returns between the organic sales from influencer content and our paid advertising the store did k in revenue last month this excludes wholesaleretail sales whats next for this store we start scaling paid ads horizontally increase spend on platforms like snapchat youtube pinterest for placements like pinterest native ads well be creating advertorials and of course we will continue creator collaborations at scale and slowly start breaking into bigger influencers and podcasts once new products are launched the company can extract a higher aov and ltv we will be more comfortable scaling further since the higher acquisition costs wont cut that deep into profits the goal is also to get the flagship product listed on various online marketplaces like amazon walmart for residual sales and look into scaling internationally in the next months oh and theres an exciting youtube seo strategy well be testing out so fingers crossed if theres enough interest i will do a followup post after the next months and share whats been working for us yet again i will also be here on reddit occasionally and answer any questions as they arise good luck everyone
ako3dd,Entrepreneur,2019-01-28 14:48:38,how i made k in one weekend as a college student with no cash it was about weeks before graduation weekend in my college town in i was a senior about to graduate my mother was bugging me to help her find a hotel near campus for graduation weekend for her my father my grandparents and my sister three rooms i called about hotels around campus checked priceline there was nothing available at all airbnb was the same the closest city with availability was about minutes away they only had rooms left in the entire hotel and they were per night plus fees each with a three night minimum even they were cashing in on graduation thats fees i refused id rather them stay home and miss graduation the closest hotels with normal pricing and availability were over an hour away i thought about my friends who were sophomores and juniors renting apartments in the area classes ended about days before graduation they all were gone for the summer working internships or back home their apartments were empty i texted a group of three friends living in a three bedroom apartment i offered them if they let my parents stay there over the weekend they quickly agreed all set with my family and we saved about my college had recently added a feature to the email google powered email if you started typing someones name it would autofill and provide you with their email address my school had about students in each class and the facebook group had about each i joined each group i then went through using one screen on the facebook group members page and one screen on the gmail page typing in names and mining email addresses about hours later i had a list with the email addresses of juniors and seniors i typed out a nice email to the juniors friends my family and a few of my classmates families are looking for a place to stay on graduation weekend if you will be gone that weekend and would be interested in renting out your apartment to them let me know thanks i then typed out this email to my fellow seniors friends a few of my undergraduate classmates are offering to rent their rooms to the families of seniors during graduation weekend if your family needs a place to stay right near campus during that weekend let me know thanks i sent both emails and then headed out to track practice when i got home hours later i had over emails in my inbox i ended up tiering the pricing based on location cleanliness ability to provide linens and amount of rooms i paid out about per room per night on average and i did a three night minimum for everyone graduation weekend is quite an ordeal so that was pretty standard anyway i rented the rooms at about per room per night this was a big savings over hotels but the guests had to be okay with a dirty apartment and bringing their own linens for the most part but they got to stay in the heart of the action and save a lot of money i set low expectations for the renters i told them it would be dirty i told them it would be sweaty i told them to bring linens and cleaning supplies if they wanted to i strictly told all of the underclassmen to clean their apartments very well i sent them detailed checklists i did the best i could to make sure it would be presentable as soon as i collected payment from the senior i would pay the underclassman and connect them on email telling them to organize the key hiding and check out stuff i kept a few apartments extra in case of emergency and ended up using one of them so im glad i did that overall i brokered about rooms and cleared about edit a few people have asked what im up to since this time here is my story i posted here a few weeks ago if you enjoyed this you might enjoy my podcast on service based entrepreneurship
zbgq3i,Entrepreneur,2022-12-03 13:49:27,i dont care if my employees watch netflix shop on amazon and only work hours a week as long as they can get assigned tasks completed as if they were working if i need more done then ill ask for it or pay for it and if they routinely abuse the relationship i fire them easy as that i think a lot of people in personal and business life get offended and threatened by the wrong things and it costs them in time and suffering my role as an entrepreneur is not to squeeze my workers for every unit of productivity as possible its to ensure that im getting a fair exchange of value thats conducive to competing my business goals if people dont do what theyre asked to do by the time i want it done we have a conversation if it becomes habitual then theyre fired and heres the kickerlow value employees are low value under a tyrannical management regime as well as a more laidback one both environments require a similar level of serial documentation to mitigate blowback from termination but only one creates undue stress and hostility for everyone involved
1cubdb0,Entrepreneur,2024-05-17 17:39:16,how ive been making over k mon since now want to give some value in particular for the younger guys as i know how the online entrepreneur space is these days smma dropshipping crypto lambos miami dubai i know what its like to see that stuff all over the internet all of these gurus infoproduct guys etc etc my average month is about kk now i do real life business i didnt just hit it once it has been consistent i had a clothing brand agency well still do and my biggest month was about k rev but the majority of money ive made was in sales ive tried dropshipping smma crypto all of it my first sales job was as a door to door canvasser setting free roof inspections for a roofing company at i didnt want to do it i had too much pride always told myself id run my own company be a millionaire before everyone else i was the only kid my age at the time into self improvement going to seminars tony robbins gary vee etc but i didnt have the vehicle to make my first money yet i eventually lost my job car got totaled i was late on rent no source of transportation and this offer came up long story short i did it and made my rent that first week which was at the time the sales guys that were closing all made over k before you make a million you need to surpass six figures now ill get deeper into the specific industry im in but i want to highlight dd and sales in general as it relates to entrepreneurs the entrepreneurial spirit is something some of us are born and gifted with it is only a matter of time before you find the vehicle to express that entrepreneurship is a sport to a degree but its a mental one not physical there are skillsets involved like in sports a fighter will train to enhance his skills speed power cardio different fighting styles boxing bjj etc i say this because as an entrepreneur your ability to succeed depends on your strengths and weaknesses and building your strengths is only a matter of putting in reps no course or pdf will put reps in for you you need to train and persistently put in those reps to enhance those skills that translate into desired outcomes and results this is where sales comes in dd is unlimited entrepreneurship training and the best part is you get paid to learn if you started a business from scratch right now with no experience youd need to sell one of two things a product or a service now in the creation of that product or service there are skillsets involved in doing so you have to build those and if you want to succeed at them you have to get good as well in sales its one primary skill youre selling someone elses product or service so you dont have to worry about the fulfillment or management of that business sales and marketing drive revenue simply speaking if you can sell and market you can profit where many young people myself included go wrong is they hear about these business models that these guys teach and try to manage a business that they know nothing about they tell you how they made k k per month and give you a blue print of what theyre doing but you didnt put in the reps they did if lebron put out a course on how to shoot better i imagine theres some value in that but you arent putting in lebrons work and with his natural gifts so youre not going to become him lock in on whats in front of you and progress by mastering one thing then learning the next skillset you know youll need to learn on the trajectory to become a master ceo this is the way not chasing online trends fb ads changes tik tik changes instagram changes markets get saturated build you now what is the industry im in exterior home restoration what is that well basically we complete work on homes from storm damage hail winds tornadoes hurricanes etc and insurance pays for the work every home owner has insurance and these companies pay for repairs to be completed like an auto body shop if you crash a car or got hail damage the company pays the shop shop does the work and boom everyones happy i started setting leads went on to closing deals then later started project managing roofing was the bread and butter but ive made the most of money so far doing niche high end windows that get damaged by hail these windows are x the cost of a roof and most contractors have no clue how to deal with the claims and install i have an llc and subcontracted by the contractors to generate deals i close the deals they complete the work this is my business and it works well i get a k avg per deal and i sell a lot if youre interested in learning more about this specific industry fire away questions or dm me im more than happy to help
10mxbuk,Entrepreneur,2023-01-27 21:57:35,made k last year while still in college ive had this in my draft post for weeks and idk if its of any value to anyone at this point but here goes got the final numbers this week and to my disbelief i xd my income between k and while still in college realizing i made this money last year hasnt made me any happier than when i worked at a restaurant for kmo but i did learn more last year than any other year about business and life hopefully theres something in here that helps someone out there my business is an ecommerce business i buy containers of product that ive whitelabelled from a manufacturer in china and sell it online i dont work from a beach in bali or drive a nice car most of my year was sitting behind a computer at my desk answering calls visiting the warehouse etc my daytoday resembles most jobs but im making enough money to support myself and building equity and thats been the goal since i got started some background my first experience in business was a drop shipping business that i started in it had all kinds of issues and stressed me the fuck out but i managed to sell it in the summer of for k people always say dont sell unless its a life changing amount of money and as dumb as it sounds k at the time was a life changing amount of money id never seen that much money at once and that check proved to me that i was at least capable of creating something valuable smiling eartoear i took my k to the bank and enjoyed the rest of the summer without a care in the world for two months i applied to jobs internships and got ready for school to start up again in the fall after a single week of classes i realized there was no way id be able to sit still for another years of school i had to start something new i started looking for product ideas my criteria was this high aov no local competition somehow related to my existing productindustry knowledge within a few weeks i stumbled on what i thought was an amazing product that fit my criteria and decided that instead of leaving my hardearned k in the sp i was going to go allin on starting my own directtoconsumer business i blamed most of the issues of the drop shipping business on how dependent i was on the supplier and thought by taking on more risk and servicing a larger portion of the value chain i could create something more sustainable and more profitable i would buy inventory from a factory overseas wait several months for it to arrive brand it and sell it online i started with one order one pallet of the product from china in november this was when shipping rates were still insane so the cost of the product was about k and the shipping was k via ocean so after some other costs ads shopify etc id pretty much put all the money i had into this new idea the first pallet took about months to arrive but in that time i was running ads sending out samples to customers and improving the website i managed to sell the entire first batch of inventory before it arrived and used that revenue to order another pallet from the factory in january by march the second pallet was sold out and i ordered my first container this was a huge jump in order size and suddenly my entire net worth was in that container plus i had k in credit card debt everything was riding on that container if something went wrong id pretty much be sol of course the manufacturer fucked it up and sent about of the inventory in the wrong colour with this terrible finishing material that looked really cheap and fake the product im selling is very aestheticbased and ive pricedmarketed it on the higher end so this was devastating to me i had a meltdown in my bedroom yelled a bunch took some deep breaths and prayed that this wouldnt sink me for weeks i had nightmares of all the star reviews returns complaints lawsuits etc but there was nothing i could do i took photos of the product as it was put it on the website and hoped for the best a small number of people complained but most people didnt seem to mind the difference or know the difference since there were virtually no competitors in this niche and the terrible inventory was sold out within a matter of weeks we even got a few positive reviews during that time which really got the ball rolling as usual when it feels like the sky is fallingit usually isnt as the months went by i kept repeating this process ordering product selling it calling customers for feedback having the factory make changes to the product selling more repeat i sold kmonth from juneseptember k in october k in november and k last month i closed out with k in revenue i netted about no employees some contractors for odd jobs and a pl from janmay i was in school taking classes while working a parttime internship in fintech in may i went full time into the business but was back to school in the fall with three classes my grades have taken a hit as the business has grown but im still on track to graduate in april ive finally hired a full time employee to handle customer service and am now working on adding new products and pursuing new markets as i said in the beginning i made k in in i depended solely on covid checks and before that i waited tables while pursuing a career in music heres a few of the things that have helped me the most over the past years be honest about your reasons for doing things ask yourself this if you could never tell a single soul about what youre doing would you still do it if you could never brag at dinner parties about owning your own business would you still want to own one if you couldnt put entrepreneur in your bio would you still want to be one if you cant answer these questions honestly reflect on your reasons for doing what you do in my experience its incredibly hard to succeed at something if your primary motivator is vanityego the life of a business owner is too ugly and painful to be worth it if youre just doing it is to flex on imaginary haters i made the biggest strides in life and business after i deleted my instagram account and havent looked back the silver bullet youre looking for is sacrificing the thing you love the most im not there yet but the one thing thats helped me progress more in life and business more than anything else has been giving up one of the things i love the most alcohol i absolutely love the feeling of being drunk but from marchoctober last year i didnt have a drop of alcohol and the business objectively wouldnt have done as well as it did if i didnt make that choice i also felt like incredibly happy considering how much bullshit i was dealing with as a neverending stream of problems and tasked continue to pile on the subconscious reward structures id built for myself alcohol to celebrate to relax to end the week etc werent really apparent until i stopped drinking same went for the escapist tendencies alcohol to forget problems mitigate anxiety i didnt realize how much of a crutch alcohol was until i cut it out for an extended period of time some people dont have crutches at all some people have different ones like weed porn video games etc if you have something that you go to when things get really hard try cutting it out for a few weeks youll be surprised at how much more you can handle than you thought even without your crutch heineken feels as good and has none of the downsides highly recommend run towards whatever scares you the most almost every single win from last year stemmed from doing something that scared the shit out of me overcommunicating with customers when their orders were delayed by months calling customers personally when they were pissed off and letting them yell at me reaching out to people who i deemed to be out of my weight class celebrities big retailers etc and pitching our product putting out content that id made myself that i was starring in on the company socials this stuff all scared the shit out of me and i wanted nothing more than to not do any of it just bury yourself in the shopify dashboard you dont need to do any of that is what i told myself every single time that i put my head down and ran towards the thing that scared me the most i was paid back times over customers went from angry to understanding big collaborators featured us at nocost and skyrocketed our growth videos went viral etc good things happened that i never wouldve imagined if it scares the shit out of you run towards it thats it i have no idea what the future will bring but these are the learnings that have stood out to me the most thus far wishing everyone a prosperous

a5jpi0,Entrepreneur,2018-12-12 16:32:07,how i made selling a meme im writing this short case study in hopes to inspire young entrepreneurs to take action on their seemingly stupid ideas because the stupid ones are the best ones i think most people on reddit are familiar with the nut button meme it was popular back in which is ancient in terms of the internets attention span despite the memes old age my friend and i have done over in sales by leveraging its virality focusing on simple seo and expanding aggressively we made that d meme into a real product a simple pushactivated sound button and automated our sales across fba the numbers revenue in proof linked at end countries profit margin hoursweek of work max tens of thousands of nuts in this world this isnt so much a guide rather just how we did things and what we learned along the way our first units inceptiontomarket my friend and i always spitball stupid ideas off each other hoping something might stick one day he called and said how has nobody made a reallife nut button lets fucking make it it sounded stupid at first but the more we talked it out the less stupid of an idea it became why it might work the marketing was already done but the product wasnt there by that i mean there were millions of sharesviews of our soontobeproduct by ways of the meme and brand recognition was there risk was only each for first units minimum order quantity upside was about each why it might not work outdatedirrelevant meme the juice was worth the squeeze we figured and if we failed we could just hand them out on the street or at school for fun so we found a manufacturer on alibaba negotiated a price in broken english and nut buttons were at my doorstep about a month later i still remember cutting into the first box and feeling a mix of excitement and extreme selfdoubt i think that mix means youre on to something i bought our domain for bucks and set up a squarespace site with all the highconversion rules that i had read on google with as few frictions as possible in mind the site contained one call to action buy now though weve broken this rule price we decided was fair product title and brief description big hero images of our product meta descriptions with seo keywords and nothing more our site was live and our nuts were hot and ready to sell but how were people going to know that we were selling we were severely outranked by the actual meme in any early google search so we opted for some paid advertising we scheduled a few posts with quasipopular instagram accounts per post and a day ad budget on facebook we waited our first day we got zero orders our second day we got one order and celebrated each day sales were slowly dribbling in and by week two we were doing five sales a day and felt like bill fucking gates logistics we bought ourselves a label printer yellow bubble mailers and a shipstationstamps account for discounted usps rates my college apartment was right across the street from the post office every morning before class i would print out labels pack the nuts and drop them off at usps eventually the post office people started calling me mr nut when i was dropping off huge garbage bags full of nuts at the same time i had set up an amazon storefront only month and we were in the process of sending inventory to fba distribution centers i also set up an ebay page for international orders since ebay has their own global distribution center and deals with customsshipping themselves i was surprised by the amount of people paying on shipping alone to have a nut button sent to their country legal protection we also realized that this product would be super easy for a big fish to produce themselves and undercut us so we spent a good amount in the beginning on legal fees trademarks and ip protection to protect us down the road definitely worth it big break our goal was alway to get the nut button viral but that seemed out of our power our paid instagram posts were met with hostile comments like gtfo normies this isnt but we were still getting around orders a day so we could take the heat sometime in november of this video link of a jack russel terrier playing with the nut button was posted within a day it had hundreds of thousands of views and shares on twitter and was soon reposted to barstool with over million followers our phones were popping off with order notifications we watched our amazon seller charts go from orders a day to at its peak well over a day we were selling more than we anticipated so many in fact that we were about to run out of inventory right before christmas zeroinventory sales it would take days to have new inventory rushproduced in china and sent to us but we were going to run out of inventory much sooner than that we did not want to lose our momentum specially during the holiday season it was mid november and manufacturer told us that we would have our new batch units which we negotiated for a much cheaper price by december th which would give us time to fulfill all christmas orders we were totally out of inventory by the end of november so my partner and i agreed to continue taking orders on amazon sellerfulfilled and our website but we messaged each buyer explaining that we were back ordered and we guaranteed that their nuts would come before christmas with a free surprise gift it was a nut sticker otherwise they could get an immediate refund no questions asked is it illegal to take orders without inventory i have no idea but surprisingly very few orders were cancelled december th was around the corner and we were devastated when tracking info started showing delays we didnt even consider the possibility of not fulfilling hundreds of christmas gift orders that we guaranteed at the same time i was still in college and finals were approaching so i was stressed as fuck lesson learned be as prepared for the bestcase scenario as you are for the worstcase i was taking a finance final exam when a truck dropped off our palette of nuts and my housemates accepted the or so kg boxes of nut buttons there were over orders that could finally be fulfilled i hired three of my friends to help me with packing and compensated them hr or offered to pay them in nut buttons they chose cash we worked into the night printing labels and packing nut buttons by midnight my room had become a sea of yellow mailer packages i had to trudge through them to get to my bed which i had more videos of this the next morning i made about twenty trips to the post office the lady working there looked on in horror as i dropped black garbage bag after black garbage bag full of nuts onto her desk we were so happy that we got everything sorted out in time that we decided to give back we found out there were workers at the factory in china where our buttons were made so we sent each of them for the holidays in return they sent us great pictures of themselves and handwritten thank you notes the minimum wage in the city where the factory is located is about hour so i think that means much more to them than it does us its been a little over a year since we started this every other day i still pack nuts from our website orders and drop them off at the post office but of fulfillment is automated by amazon these days we were recently accepted into an amazon program called small and light which enormously reduced our fees and increased our profits we also decided to test out different price points so we tried for a couple days to see what kind of effect it had on sales weirdly enough our sales for that week were actually greater than they were at so we havent looked back since maybe its a perceived value thing or the nut button just has really inelastic demand weve also expanded via amazon eu into the uk germany france spain and italy despite the annoyance of vat taxes weve added roughly to our overall sales since last holiday season weve improved total sales by about and steeply improved our margins this coming january my partner and i planned a trip to china where well go meet the factory boss and employees and give them another holiday bonus thanks for hearing our story i dont mean this in any ways to be selfpromotion i just want to share our story and some fun stuff in getting the business off the ground and hopefully inspire someone along the way im happy to answer any and all questions you guys have xb bonus edit i believe my most loyal consumers are furries so shoutout to you weirdos for those asking here is our site

9n8xyj,Entrepreneur,2018-10-11 11:03:40,inventrepreneurship i took an idea to mass production with less than including biz filing and website fees and turned it into a kweek profit business in months heres my process to get a simple invention from idea to mass production tldr at bottom i apologize ahead of time if formatting is terrible i dont really understand reddit formatting let me preface this by saying that my initial product the one this guide is based off of was very simple its polycarbonate no metals electronics textile etc its also extremely small maybe in length height and thick also i will not disclose my product because there are still corners in the market i have not captured yet but am in the process of capturing xb total cost xb first step ideation and market assessment my cost you have to have an idea how and whether you choose to litmus test the market or not is up to you i personally just looked at my market and saw that no one had created a product for it there were videos with hundreds of thousands of views on how to jerry rig up a device that accomplished what i eventually simplified and mass produced it was a bit of a risk and at every stage id have doubts about whether or not i was wasting my time creating something destined to fail i went into this product expecting to sell units over years xb next step design my cost the next step for me was designing i drew a very crude drawing on a sticky note at work and wasnt really sure where to go from here i figured i would need a d prototype somehow i found a local business that does d printing but even better they did d cad computerassisted design as well so i was able to explain to them my concept an engineer made a cad model we had to make a few adjustments before getting it just right then i had prototypes printed out im not sure what each charge was but going through my banking history i can see my charges for this were so thats my total cad and prototyping cost for this phase heres a price list from the company i used for cad and prototyping xb next step registering your business my cost i probably should have done this step before prototyping but i was learning as i went and wasnt extremely sure whether or not this would come to fruition once it became evident that i was actually going to do this i got an ein assigned free via irsgov i went through the local name filing and llc filing for the name filing fee and for the llc filing fee for expedited service also set up transaction privilege tax and anything else i may not be able to think of at this moment xb next step mass production my cost this is a part in any consumer product where i think a lot of people get stuck i will outline my process though itll vary depending on your product my process is the way i found with zero guidance there very well could be more efficient processes that i am unaware of but this process has served me now for separate original inventions i had a cad in stp and stl formats i had prototypes printed the company i used for my cad offered to run me a batch of cold casted product for about pc i put down a deposit for a run of pieces there were several attempts to make the product but the quality was always just not quite there i think cold casting just cannot achieve the quality i needed for my product not only that but the end product was quite heavy i didnt follow through with the product and just cut my losses on the deposit they tried and that matters in justifying my losses but in the end they werent cut out for the work so i reached out to some injection molding companies in the us one notable one i remember was icomold i found them through some websites as i was searching for an injection molder they were suggested because they either have no or low moq minimum order qty and they were supposedly lowcost i got an instant quote from them and the pricing for that came out to as far as i understood the quote here is the quote i received unfortunately i didnt have so i kept looking eventually i decided to reach out to businesses on alibaba i found businesses that made products similar to mine or made products that used materials similar to mine polycarbonate and simply asked if they could injection mold custom designs i may have even put out an rfq request for quote i got several responses and quotes and though there were some cheaper quotes i settled on another company simply because they pointed out issues with the design that other companies had missed draft angles and thickness issues etc so i could tell they knew what they were doing and provided good quality they reengineered the design to be injection mold compatible free of charge their quote for the mold and units the product is made up of separate pieces that join together came out to before shipping they made some d printed prototypes on a seemingly very high end machine because it almost looked like an injection molded product with how smooth and wellmade it was it was the best prototype i had received up to this point i paid to have that prototype shipped then another to have my first batch of final products shipped from china to the us product arrived looked fantastic and was ready for sale xb final step sales my cost varying salesfulfillment fees this step was interesting because i didnt really do any advertising at first for the product i paid for wix for year but after leaving the site they sent me a coupon so i paid i built out a website and got an amazon sellers account i listed the product on amazon for usdpc my costs per piece not including the mold are about cpc then there are amazon fees and packaging amazon fees are something around per sale for me packaging is pennies on the dollar i use polybags and card stock paper toppers i know i should but i dont even take packaging costs into account because the margins are so large one thing about listing on amazon is you need upc codes usually these are supposed to be obtained via gs i bought upcs for via gs since there was already a market i didnt really need to advertise it people just searched basic keywords on amazon and i was the only option once it was listed it started gaining its own traction i got or sales the first month and it climbed and climbed from there i remember when it hit week in profit i was kind of freaking out thinking i had made it and couldnt get over how proud i was of myself for creating this mass produced product i had never manufactured a tangible item before so it was really cool for me sometimes i would just be sitting and turn to my buddy and say dude i cant believe i created this an actual product it was pretty surreal for a while and i still have moments where i just take in what ive built its been just over a year since it hit the market in that time i have produced more original ideas the product is now on sales platforms in continents countries theres a resale market for my product on ebay which i found cool the product alone pulls about in profit per week product costs me pc after shipping from china to us then amazon fees are and change i list product for usd on all sales fronts shipping costs about within the us for every pcs i send to amazon pretty insignifcant cost i also sell on my website and on ebay ebay is in fees website i dont have fees aside from my subscription as well as shipping which they pay for if you think about the income this product brings its really not much when you consider how large the audience base is which just proves to me that you really dont need to make a massively popular product to do well if you can just take a tiny percentage of a large customer base you can do quite well i think a lot of people that call out other businesses for being deceitful about how successful they are silicone rings dont realize that small products can make large figures with the right margins and the right reach one last thing i want to note we are in an age where being an inventor is easier than its ever been we have an endless supply of information and resources we are so well connected to engineers designers factories etc before the common sentiment was that ideas are worthless because everyone has them i still believe this to be true ideas used to be extremely worthless because everyone had them and no one had the guidance to create them we are now at the stage where it is very easy to take an idea to production on your own its still early enough in that stage that not many people understand the process however its getting more and more saturated every day one day the only thing holding an idea from reality will be money and even then it will likely become a much smaller factor than it is now i expect that product creation will soon find entry numbers comparable to hobbyists entering videography or coding in that what was once a specialized field of knowledge limited to a small number of people is becoming easier and easier to enter into with zero experience if that makes sense right now i feel like the thing holding people back is that they dont understand the how of production and dont have the funding they dont know where to start and the first speed bump they hit is where they stop those speed bumps are being scraped off by the efficiency of technology every single day soon itll be a straight road with a speed limit of mph ive given you a slightly upgraded suspension system get ahead while youve got the competitive edge xb some of my favorite tools in creating a productbusiness fiverr upwork alibaba google google google canva quick note i waited to patent this product until a little after it hit the market because i didnt have the funding to do it before that its kind of a niché product and i wasnt worried about anyone stealing the idea and they didnt the patent application has now been filed so its pp and cost me about warning once your product hits the public you have year to patent it if you wait longer than that you become ineligible to apply for a patent or you can apply but risk someone challenging it if they find proof to go against you tldr hire cad designer prototype find production factory i use alibaba theyre not only useful for buying already existing products sell profit

than that what we do im the founder and ceo of smart alto the easiest way to set minute phone appointments with homebuyers real estate agents advertise homes on zillow realtorcom homescom and other places the problem is when homebuyers want to meet with real estate agents to view properties real estate agents almost never respond to the inquiries because theyre busy doing other stuff we built technology that sends text messages to those homebuyers within minutes asks them a few simple questions and then sets minute phone appointments on the real estate agents calendar that way the homebuyer always gets their questions answered and can then schedule time with the real estate agent to go see the home i used to work for a real estate brokerage to set appointments for real estate agents so i know this problem very well pulling back the curtain on my startup im pulling back the curtain on my startup and going to show you exactly what i did to take it from to year and beyond

superpower data opinions i dont care what any one person thinks i focus on what sizable groups of potential customers do did you catch that i focus on what they do rather than what they think or say people will often tell you one thing and do something entirely different screw your opinion i set up experiments collect data measure results and take action asymmetric riskrewards ray dalio jack bogle jeff bezos and other folks i study all basically say the same thing take affordable risks and look for outsized returns with a return you can screw up four times and still break even with one winner i like those odds partnerships partnerships are great but theyre only worth pursuing after youve had some success thats true because people dont really want to help you they want to help themselves and when youre not successful its hard for them to see how working with you is going to help them the more successful you are the easier it is to land a partnership that skyrockets your success my final thoughts dont take it personally most people arent going to support you in fact theyre probably going to hate and try to tear you down dont take this personally and dont waste your energy by getting mad or upset its not their job to believe in you thats your job my friend become successful and then make a post like this one to help them out you are the enemy im literally giving the playbook and ill be around to answer questions in the comments but most people havent read this far and they wont ask questions and they wont take action instead theyre learning how to design their own logo using sketch take massive action getting an llc designing a pretty logo hunting for the perfect domain name doing years of market research overthinking your next move listening to haterstrolls etc are all reasons people never take action and ultimately fail be humble be confident dont be overconfident and think you have all the answers in the same breath believe in yourself and dont overoptimize for someone elses opinion all the time collect your own data with small experimentstests and take it from there be positive i dont want to get all tony robbins on you man but you really can do this its hard work sometimes it sucks like really sucks the more successful you become the more haters you get hobbies are lost friendships fade but the good outweighs the bad by to so trust me you got it and if you need help then i got you if youre ever in doubt then refer back to this post because this is your ski lift so go make it snowfall i hoped this post gave you the confidence and energy needed to get to work how to reach me if you have an interesting problem youre working on and think id be a cool partner or just want some encouragement then let me know in the comments follow me on facebook given the dm request i edited to add my facebook group if you want to join my community where i plan to talk about all this stuff in more detail then lets do it homie im

18t5n8e,Entrepreneur,2023-12-28 21:51:34,how i went from k a day to zero now living checktocheck two years ago i used to make k a day in revenue by myself from my bedroom with a consistent profit margin now i work a regular job and basically live check to check and struggle to pay bills before i start i wanna say im not really sure what the point of posting this is i guess it can be looked at as a cautionary tale or an interesting anecdote or maybe you guys will have some similar stories to tell not really asking for advice necessarilly but am open to hearing any honest feedback after telling my story ill try and keep it concise late early before the pandemic i was working sales at a highish end car dealership brutal hours but fun and challenging although colleagues sales tactics were morally questionable at times was making kk a month one day i sold a car that had a bonus on it and combined with my hourly i made like that day at that point that was the most money i had ever made in one day and i was hyped i get home that day and excitedly tell my year old buddy about my day which i spent hours at the dealership working hard to get he goes thats cool i just made today and i was cruising around in my mustang all day he was drop shipping jewelry on instagramfacebook and was doing k profit a day and about an hour of work at most at this moment i have an epiphany and i say to myself what the fuck am i doing i begin researching drop shipping and getting mentorship from my buddy after a month or two of trying products out and spending k on ads and nothing hitting covid hit the world a week or two before covid hit i had launched my th attempt at a drop shipping product finally a sale first week im doing sales a day and either barely breaking even or making profit pandemic hits full swing early march car dealership lays everyone off including me im jobless two weeks after being laid off boss calls me and says he wants me back my store is doing a day profit at this point i see a potential future in this so i make the tough decision to tell my boss no and focus on my store over next months through the end of and into store grows massively at its peak im doing k a day in revenue and a day profit i feel rich and like i finally made it keep in mind that throughout this whole process i did very little maintenance work for the first ad creative i launched it was pieced together from other companies ads who sold the same thing probably did my first k in sales off that ad then filmed my own milked the second ad for a couple hundred thousand bucks and only after that ad died i made a rd and final ad creative which i milked for another few k in sales my strategy was extremely simple to scale just launch a video creative and make a cbo with different interests and keep increasing the budget if its profitable at one point i was spending k a day on ads earlymid the revenue starts dwindling but i had more money than i ever had at my peak i was sitting on about k liquid cash in my bank account still running ads off the same video creative i filmed months ago and steadily bringing in a couple hundred bucks per day midlate the creative wasnt profitable anymore and money stopped coming in i start focusing on other things like getting my first apartment new gf hobbies etc also had pay a hefty tax bill while i had money i was living lavish buying stuff on a whim bought a new pc eating out being wasteful in general with money since it seemed to come so easy it seemed like my thought process was basically making all this money was so easy so ill just relax and enjoy the money ive made so far and when it runs low ill start a new product and be fine fast forward early i look up one day and its been many months since ive made a single dollar running ads and all of a sudden im down to k in my bank account which is basically like months worth of expenses at most im fucked moneys run out even if i wanted to start a new store i dont have any excess money and am literally scraping by to pay bills with odd jobs midlate got the job that im currently kyr at which pays my bills and leaves me with a little bit of extra money every month but not much today in finally established enough at this job to have enough extra money each month to not desperately worry about bills and have some extra to invest currently looking to restart my entrepreneurial journey and do things better this time around some key takeaways im a lazy idiot money management is important dont forget to set aside money for taxes just because you struck gold once doesnt mean anything unless its repeatable be consistent and dont get comfortable once you start seeing success some questions that may arise after reading this why didnt i just continue making video adsstart another store when the money got low or even while it was successful good question i really dont know maybe laziness maybe procrastination maybe a false sense of security any time i got the nagging feeling to maintain my store or do work id just see the random or whatever i made that day and id go eh i can get to it later i got nothing to worry about even to this day i struggle with that at this point its been over two years ive tried launching a few new stores but they failed and were few and far between i still feel like if i put real effort in i could be back to making money like i was before within months i will say that i dont think my success was a fluke as i pay great attention to detail and it wasnt an accident i deliberately studied and perfected my website video creatives customer service fulfillment sales funnel etc and understand why the success happened and how it happened the main problem i seem to have is just this procrastination devil on my shoulder that convinces me not to take action when action is necessary maybe its too strong of a things will be alright and work themselves out mentality which is useful is some aspects of life but may be detrimental to a persistent entrepreneurial mindset anyway not really sure how to summarize this tldr worked hour days as a car salesman making k a month started a drop shipping business making profit a day stopped maintaining storeprofit stopped and blew almost k in savings living lavish lifestyle for over a year until i became broke and had to get a regular job to pay my bills has anyone experienced anything similar would love to hear your thoughts on this story edit for those asking what kind of store it was it was a one product store selling a portable medical device for about
ayzlqu,Entrepreneur,2019-03-09 04:26:06,i lost nearly selling on amazon fba with all the success stories i wonder if people would appreciate hearing about a sheer unadulterated failure of a business in i started my first business selling with amazon fba i followed every guru gimmic in the book i sourced a niche product from china but the niche became so saturated i ended up selling my product for next to nothing and giving away much of my inventory in the hopes of reviewsbetter ranking here is a breakdown of the money i lost on inventory unit order for freight forwarder ocean freight on pay per click ads got out of hand really fast another between professional photography and artworkbranding design misc fba subscription barcode registration product samples etc i learned a lot for sure my main takeaway was not to follow a cookiecutter scheme that promises a guarenteed revenue stream after following easy steps amazon fba is not passive income its a full time job one i had nowhere near the time for if everyone is doing something it may not be the best idea dont run off the cliff with the lemmings as much of a gut punch this experience has been i have tried to learn from it and have a better idea of what not to do in future ventures

179uxji,Entrepreneur,2023-10-17 10:09:14,watched hours of mrbeasts content here are psychological strategies hes used to get billion views mrbeast can fill giant stadiums and launch figure candy companies on demand hes unbelievably popular recently i listened to the brilliant marketer phill agnew from the nudge podcast being interviewed on the creator science podcast the episode focused on how mrbeasts nearacademic understanding of audience psychology is the key to his success better than anyone mrbeast knows how to get you click on his content increase his clickthrough rate get you to stick around increase his retention rate he gets you to click by using irresistible thumbnails and headlines i watched hours of his content to build upon phil agnews work i made a list of psychological effects and biases hes consistently used to write headlines that get clicked into oblivion even the most aggressively anticlickbait purists out there would benefit from learning the psychology of why people choose to click on some content over others ultimately if you dont get the click it really doesnt matter how good your content is novelty effect mrbeast headline i put million orbeez in my friends backyard mrbeast often presents something so out of the ordinary that they have no choice but to click and find out more thats the novelty effect at play our brains reward system is engaged when we encounter something new youll notice that the headline examples you see in this list are extreme mrbeast takes things to the extreme you dont have to heres your takeaway consider breaking the readerviewers scrolling pattern by adding some novelty to your headlines how here are two ways find the unique angle in your content find an unusual character in your content examples how moonlight walks skyrocketed my productivity meet the artist who paints with wine and chocolate headlines like these catch the eye without requiring million orbeez costly signaling mrbeast headline last to leave island keeps it heres the step clickthrough process at play here mrbeast lets you know hes invested a very significant amount of time and money into his content this signals to whoever reads the headline that its probably valuable and worth their time they click to find out more costly signaling is all amount showcasing what youve invested into the content the higher the stakes the more valuable the content will seem in this example the island hes giving away just screams this is worth your time again they dont need to be this extreme here are two examples with a little more subtlety i built a fullscale botanical garden in my backyard i used only vintage cookware from the s for a week not too extreme but not too subtle either numerical precision mrbeast knows that using precise numbers in headlines just work almost all of his most popular videos use headlines that contain a specific number going through the same drive thru times squid game in real life yes these headlines also use costly signaling but theres more to it than that precise numbers are tangible they catch our eye pique our curiosity and add a sense of authenticity the concreteness effect specific concrete information is more likely to be remembered than abstract intangible information i went through the same drive thru times is more impactful than i went through the same drive thru countless times contrast mrbeast headline vs hotel room our brains are drawn to stark contrasts and mrbeast knows it his headlines often pit two extremes against each other it instantly creates a mental image of both scenarios youre not just curious about what a hotel room looks like youre also wondering how it could possibly compare to a room was the difference wildly significant was it actually not as significant as youd think it increases the audiences curiosity gap enough to get them to click and find out more here are a few ways you could use contrast in your headlines effectively transformational content from to a m empire how a small town accountant took on silicon valley here youre contrasting different states or conditions of a single subject transformation stories and beforeandafter scenarios youve got the added benefit of people being drawn to aspirationalinspirational stories direct comparison local diner vs gourmet bistro where does the best comfort food lie nostalgia mrbeast headline i built willy wonkas chocolate factory nostalgia is a longing for the past its often triggered by sensory stimuli smells songs images etc it can feel comforting and positive but sometimes bittersweet nostalgia can provide emotional comfort identity reinforcement and even social connection people are drawn to it and mrbeast has it down to a tee he created a fantasy world most people on this planet came across at some point in their childhood while the headline does play on costly signaling here as well nostalgia does help to clinch the click and get the view subtle examples of nostalgia at play how this old school cartoon is shaping new age animation your favorite childhood books are getting major movie deals morbid curiosity mrbeast headline surviving hours straight in the bermuda triangle people are drawn to the macabre and the dangerous morbid curiosity explains why youre drawn to situations that are disturbing frightening or gruesome its that tension between wanting to avoid harm and the irresistible desire to know about it its a peculiar aspect of human psychology and viral content marketers take full advantage of it the bermuda triangle is practically synonymous with danger the headline suggests a pretty extreme encounter with it so we click to find out more fomo and urgency mrbeast headline last to leave island keeps it fomo the worry that others may be having fulfilling experiences that youre absent from marketers leverage fomo to drive immediate action clicking subscribing purchasing etc the action is driven by the notion that delay could result in missing out on an exciting opportunity or event you could argue that mrbeast uses fomo and urgency in all of his headlines they work under the notion that a delay in clicking could result in missing out on an exciting opportunity or event mrbeasts timesensitive challenge exclusive opportunities and highstakes competitions all generate a sense of urgency people feel compelled to watch immediately for fear of missing out on the outcome or being left behind in conversations about the content creators writers and marketers can tap into fomo with their headlines without being so extreme the hidden parisian cafe to visit before the crowds do how tech innovation will soon change industry for good yep fomo and urgency are primarily responsible for the proliferation of airelated headlines these days why this all matters if you dont have content you need people to consume it probably doesnt but if any aspect of your online business would benefit from people clicking on things more it probably does yes because we all need more clickbait in this world eyeroll emoji disgruntled redditor i never really understood this comment but i seem to get it pretty often my stance is this if the content delivers what the headline promises it shouldnt be labeled clickbait i wouldnt call mrbeasts content clickbait the fact is that linguistic techniques can be used to drive people to consume some content over others you dont need to take things to the extremes that mrbeast does to make use of his headline techniques if content doesnt get clicked it wont be read viewed or listened to no matter how brilliant the content might be while clickbait content isnt a good thing we can all learn a thing or two from how they generate attention in an increasingly noisy digital world

zazagy,Entrepreneur,2022-12-02 22:03:30,how to start a business an indepth guide from a successful business owner hey everyone today im going to share with you the most important knowledge that ive accumulated from starting different companies reading books on business and personal development and most importantly successfully breaking in yearly revenue my goal is that if even person reads this and it gives them the confidence to get started i will have contributed positively to somebodies life and that brings me joy onward pick a business model this is the easiest part to get hung up on the way ive conquered this obstacle is by realizing i dont have to reinvent the wheel there are thousands of profitable business models in the world and if you truly want to live the dream of financial freedom and break the chains of the you can very simply pick one and replicate it remember good artists borrow great artists steal okay but how do i pick one there are so many that its hard to choose dont worry i got you choice paralysis is real we all get it here are the variables you need to be investigating and doing the math around in order to pick the right business for you variable cost to start up aka barrier to entry this variable is identified by simply imagining what would go into starting this business what are the costs associated with those things imagine you were starting a meal prep business you would need the right kitchen equipment plastic containers the food itself and the transportation to bring it to the clients investigate how much these things would cost you and total it up the number you land on is the barrier to entry cost write this down xb variable skills needed to be successful in this industry some businesses require experts while others can utilize high school students at minimum wage if you are already an expert in a field it may be easier to build something you are comfortable with but its absolutely not a requirement out of the companies i have built i was only fluent in and my most successful i knew nothing about figure out which skills are needed and do some thinking do you have access to people with these skills can you hire people with these skills can you learn these skills in a day on youtube typically the lower the skill needed the more simple a business will be and trust me you want simple because once you start doing millions in revenue the headaches will pile up variable how long will it take to get this business operational you would be surprised how quickly you can start most businesses in a matter of weeks i had people calling my phone for my biggest company and all it took were some street signs do some thinking on how long it will take for you to buy all the necessary equipment and get that phone to ring do you need a website do you need equipment or a product that will take months to develop or get to you i highly recommend starting with a business model that can be operational in under a month i say this because in order to withstand the punches that the business world will throw at you it helps to see tangible progress when you spend months in rd its tough to stay motivated personal tips for choosing your first business model dont start a business where you will need to raise money to be successful chances are if you are reading this its not happening the people that successfully raise money typically have rich parents or already have a track record of success choose a model you have close to enough cash to fund yourself my businesses had barriertoentry costs ranging from as low as k to as high as k choose a model that doesnt require fulltime experts these people cost a lot of money to employ and they typically dont want the risk of working with a precash flow business choose a model that you can spin up in a couple of weeks to a month xb by now you should have a couple of assets in your head which model you like the things you need and how much they cost and which skills you will need to hire for or know yourself to be successful now what now we build depending on your model you will have or more of the followinggoogle listing and website google listing you can make yourself but unless youre experienced in web development and digital product marketing do not do this yourself it is a colossal waste of time and it will hurt your ability to make the phone ring because it will take months and months of iterating in order for it to be halfway decent hire someone to build a website for you there are services that do it for a startup fee and a month dont build your own site with the websitegoogle listing live we now focus on sales and in order to do that we need to make the phone ring aka drive leads depending on the industry you choose these are the magic tools that will bring you money google pay per click i cant stress this enough it works of industries can utilize google ppc meal prep ppc cleaning service ppc ecomm ppc sex toys also ppc i spend roughly k a month on ppc its magic average setup cost facebook ads and instagram ads known your target audience before spending money here does your audience live on these platforms does your industry fit on a social media platform where people are probably watching cat videos average setup cost angis list and other contractor platforms the leads can be hit or miss but they absolutely will make your phone ring average setup cost monthly upwork and other freelance platforms lower quality leads but a great way to cut your teeth in an industry setup cost free yard signs zip tied to telephone poles ive used this in several of my businesses and it has driven hundreds of thousands of revenue legal disclaimer i dont know the rules of your area but in mine certain towns call us and say its not allowed and others leave them up or take them down themselves you can get signs for roughly from your local sign maker those signs could stay up for years and drive you significant revenue vista print signs are much cheaper quality than something you would get locally if you want the sign to last years dont skimp on the you would save the equation is simple how much does it cost to create customer using x ad platform and how much profit does customer on average bring your business if the profit created is higher than the cost to acquire the customer then it is a successful marketing strategy and you can dump thousands into it and consistently make a profit okay but what if i dont know how to set up google ppc or facebook ads no problem i dont either heres where the special sauce comes in listen carefully when you dont know something but you need it in order to build the business do this exactly go to upwork or a similar site create a detailed simple and kind job posting that shows that you mean business and are serious about hiring for this position book calls with as many experts as you possibly can i personally just put my phone number on the listing and open the floodgates because the scheduling process can be annoying talk to atleast experts describing what you need to accomplish and asking them specifically how they would go about accomplishing it if you were to hire them ask

worry for ranking will be lcp largest contentful paint under s fid first input delay under ms cls cumulative layout shift under step keyword research once your website is optimized its time to define your seo strategy the best way to get started with this is by doing keyword research first off you want to create a keyword research sheet this is going to be your main hub for all your content operations you can use the sheet to prioritize content keep track of the publishing process get a topdown view of your web pages and heres what it covers target search phrase this is the keyword youre targeting priority whats the priority of this keyword we usually divide them by priority top priority keywords these are usually low competition high traffic wellconverting or all at the same time priority midpriority keywords priority these are low priority status whats the status of the article we usually divide them by not written writer has picked up the topic for the week the article is being written the article is in editing phase the article is published on the blog topic cluster the category that the blog post belongs to monthly search volume selfexplanatory this helps you pick a priority for the keyword cpc low high bid cost per click for the keyword generally unless youre planning to run search ads these are not mandatory they can however help you figure out which of your keywords will convert better pro tip the higher the cpc the more likely it is for the keyword to convert well now that you have your sheet and understand how it works lets talk about the how of keyword research how to do keyword research stepbystep guide there are a ton of different ways to do that check the further readings at the end of this section for a detailed rundown our favorite method however is as follows start off by listing out your top seo competitors the key here is seo competitors competing companies that have a strong seo presence in the same niche not sure whos a good seo competitor google the top keywords that describe your product and find your topranking competitors run them through semrush or your favorite seo tool and youll see how well exactly theyre doing with their seo once you have a list of competitors run each of them through organic research on semrush and youll get a complete list of all the keywords they rank on now go through these keywords one by one and extract all the relevant ones and add them to your sheet once you go through the top seo competitors your keyword research should be around done now to put some finishing touches on your keyword research run your top keywords through ubersuggest and let it do its magic its going to give you a bunch of keywords associated with the keywords you input go through all the results its going to give you extract anything thats relevant and your keyword research should be done at this point you can call it a day and move on to the next step chances are over time youll uncover new keywords to add to your sheet and get you to that sweet step create seo landing pages remember how we collected a bunch of landing page keywords in step now its time to build the right page for each of them this step is a lot more straightforward than youd think first off you create a custom landing page based on the keyword depending on your niche this can be done in ways create a general template landing page pretty much copypaste your landing page alter the subheadings paraphrase it a bit and add relevant images to the usecase youd go with this option if the keywords youre targeting are very similar to your main usecase eg project management software project management system create a unique landing page for each usecase you should do this if each usecase is unique for example if your software doubles as project management software and workflow management software in this case youll need two completely new landing pages for each keyword once you have a bunch of these pages ready you should optimize them for their respective keywords you can do this by running the page content through an seo tool if youre using wordpress you can do this through rankmath or yoast seo both tools will give you exact instructions on how to optimize your page for the keyword if youre not using wordpress you can use surferseo just copypaste your web page content and its going to give you instructions on how to optimize it once your new landing pages are live you need to pick where you want to place them on your website we usually recommend adding these pages to your websites navigation menu header or footer finally once you have all these new landing pages up you might be thinking now what how and when are these pages going to rank generally landing pages are a tad harder to rank than content see with content quality plays a huge part write better longer and more informative content than your competition and youre going to eventually outrank them even if they have more links with landing pages things arent as cut and dry more often than not you cant just create a better landing page what determines rankings for landing page keywords are backlinks if your competitors have links on their landing pages while yours has chances are youre not going to outrank them step create seo blog content now lets talk about the other side of the coin content keywords and how to create content that ranks as we mentioned before these keywords arent directintent the googler isnt specifically looking for your product but they can still convert pretty well for example if youre a digital marketing agency you could rank on keywords like lead generation techniques saas marketing seo content after all anyone looking to learn about lead gen techniques might also be willing to pay you to do it for them on top of this blog post keywords are way easier to rank for than your landing pages you can beat competition simply by creating significantly better content without turning it into a backlink warin order to create good seo content you need to do things right create a comprehensive content outline get the writing part right heres how each of these work how to create a content outline for seo a content outline is a document that has all the info on what type of information the article should contain usually this includes which headers and subheaders you should use whats the optimal word count what information exactly should each section of the article cover if youre not using yoast or rankmath you can also mention the seo optimization requirements keyword density of outbound links etc outlines are useful if youre working with a writing team that isnt familiar with seo allowing them to write content that ranks without any seo knowhow at the same time even if youre the one doing the writing an outline can help you get a topdown idea of what you should cover in the article so how do you create an outline heres a simplified stepbystep process determine the target word count rule of thumb aim for x x whatever your competitor wrote you can disregard this if your competition was super comprehensive with their content and just go for the same length instead create a similar header structure as your competition indicate for the writer which headers should be h which ones h for each header mention what its about pro tip you can borrow ideas from the top ranking articles for each header explain what exactly should the writer mention in simple words finally do some firsthand research on reddit and quora what are the questions your target audience has around your topic what else could you add to the article that would be super valuable for your customers how to write well theres a lot more to good content than giving an outline to a writer sure they can hit all the right points but if the writing itself is mediocre no ones going to stick around to read your article here are some essential tips you should keep in mind for writing content or managing a team of writers write for your audience are you a bb enterprise saas your blog posts should be more formal and professional bc superconsumer product talk in a more casual relaxed fashion sprinkle your content with pop culture references for bonus points avoid fluff every single sentence should have some sort of value conveying information cracking a joke etc avoid beating around the bush and be as straightforward as possible keep your audiences knowledge in mind for example if your audience is a bunch of rocket scientists you dont have to explain to them how create a writer guideline or just steal ours edit sorry had to remove link due to posting guidelines use grammarly and hemingway the first is like your personal pocket editor and the latter helps make your content easier to read hire the right writers chances are youre too busy to write your own content we usually recommend using problogger or cult of copy job board facebook group to source top writing talent step start linkbuilding operations links are essential if you want your content or web pages to rank if youre in a competitive niche links are going to be the final deciding factor on what ranks and what doesnt in the vpn niche for example everyone has good content thats just the baseline the real competition is in the backlinks to better illustrate this example if you google best vpn youll see that all topranking content pieces are almost the same thing theyre all wellwritten longform easy to navigate wellformatted to enhance ux so the determining factor is links if you check all the topranking articles with the moz toolbar extension youll see that on average each page has a minimum of links and some over meaning to compete youll really need to doubledown on your linkbuilding effort in fact in the most competitive seo niches its not uncommon to spend per month on linkbuilding efforts alone xb pro tip got scared by the high some companies spend on linkbuilding well worry not only the most evergreen niches are so competitive think vpn make money online health and fitness dating cbd gambling etc so you know the usual culprits for most other niches you can even rank with minimal links as long as you have toptier seo content now lets ask the milliondollar question how do you do linkbuilding evergreen link building strategies for any website there are a ton of different link building strategies on the web broken link building scholarship link building stealing competitor links and so on and so on and so on were not going to list every single link building strategy out there mainly because backlinko already did that in their link building guide what we are going to do though is list out some of our favorite strategies and link you to resources where you can learn more broken link building you find dead pages with a lot of backlinks reach out to websites that linked to them and pitch them something like hey you linked to this article but its dead we thought youd want to fix that you can use our recent article if you think its cool enough guest posting probably the most popular link building strategy find blogs that accept guest posts and send them a pitch they usually let you include dofollow links back to your website linkable asset link building a linkable asset is a resource that is so awesome that you just cant help but link to think infographics online calculators firsthand studies or research stuff like that the tldr here is you create an awesome resource and promote the hell out of it on the web skyscraper technique the skyscraper technique is a term coined by backlinko the gist of it is you find linkworthy content on the web create something even better and reach out to the right people most of these strategies work and you can find a ton of resources on the web if you want to learn more however if youre looking for something a bit different oh boy we have a treat for you were going to teach you a linkbuilding strategy that got us around traffic within a week leads links and so much more all through a single blog post linkbuilding case study saas marketing so whats this ancient linkbuilding tactic i hear you asking it must be something super secretive and esoteric right secrets learned straight from the linkbuilding monks at an ancient seo temple right well not quite the tactic isnt something too unusual its pretty famous on the web this tactic comes in steps figure out where your target audience hangs out create a list of the channels research the type of content your audience loves create epic content based on that research give tons of value promote the hell out of it in the channels from step nothing too new right well youd be surprised how many people dont use it now before you start throwing stones at us for overhyping something so simple lets dive into the case study how we prd the hell out of our guide to saas marketing cant add a link but its on our blog and its k words long and got k traffic as a result a few months back when we launched our blog we were deciding on what our initial content should be about since we specialize in helping saas companies acquire new users we decided to create a megaauthority guide to saas marketing and try to get it to rank for its respective keyword we went through the topranking content pieces and saw that none of them was anything too impressive most of them were about general startup marketing strategies how to validate your mvp find a productmarket fit etc pretty meh if you ask us we believe that the thing founders are looking for when googling saas marketing are practical channels and tactics you can use to acquire new users so it all started off with an idea create a listicle of the top saas marketing tactics out there how to create good content to drive users promote your content rank on google create viral infographics create a microsite and we ended up overdoing it covering different tactics and case studies and hitting around k words on one hand oops on the other hand we had some pretty epic content on our hands we even added the smart content filter to make the article much easier to navigate once the article was up we ran it through some of our clients friends and acquaintances and received some really good feedback so now we knew it was worth promoting the hell out of it we came up with a huge list of all online channels that would appreciate this article r entrepreneur and r startups hi guys the first ended up loving the post netting us upboats and a platinum medal the latter also ended up loving the post but the mods decided to be assholes and remove it for being selfpromotional so despite the community loving the content it got axed by the mods sad fun fact this one time we tried to submit another content piece on r startups with no company names no links back to our website or anything that can be deemed promotional one of the mods removed it for mentioning a link to ahrefs go figure hacker news tons of founders hang out on hn so we thought theyd appreciate anything saasrelated this netted us around upvotes and some awesome feedback thanks hn submit on growth hackers indie hackers and all other online marketing communities we got a bunch of love on indie hackers the rest were quite inactive reach out to all personal connects clients and ask for a share run facebooktwitter ads this didnt particularly work out too well for us so we dropped it after weeks run a quuu promotion if you havent heard of quuu its a platform that matches people who want their content to be shared with people who want their social media profiles running on autopilot we also got meh results here tons of shares next to no likes or link clicks promoted in saas and marketing facebook groups this had awesome results both in terms of traffic as well as making new friends and getting new leads promoted in entrepreneur slack channels this worked ok didnt net us traffic but got us some new friends emailed anyone we mentioned in the article and asked for a share since we mentioned too many high profile peeps and not enough noncelebs this didnt work out too well emailed influencers that we thought would like the article give it a share they didnt we were heartbroken and accordingly created a checklist distribution sheet with all the websites or emails of people we wanted to ping overall this netted us around page views in total leads traffic in just promotion days as for seo results we got a bunch of links i would have added screenshots to all of these results but dont think this subreddit allows it a lot of these are nofollow from reddit hackernews and other submission websites but a lot of them are also pretty authentic the cool part about this linkbuilding tactic is that people link to you without even asking you create awesome content that helps people and you get rewarded with links shares and traffic and as for the cherry on top only months after publishing the article its ranking on position were expecting it to get to page within the new few months and top within the year step interlink your pages one of googles ranking factors is how long your visitors stick around on your website so you need to encourage users reading one article to read well the rest of them or at least browse around your website this is done through interlinking the idea is that each of your web pages should be linked to and from every other relevant page on your site say an article on how to make a resume could link to and be linked from how to include contact info on a resume how to write a cover letter whats the difference between a cv and a resume and so on proper interlinking alone can have a significant impact on your website rankings ninjaoutreach for example managed to improve their organic traffic by through better interlinking alone so how do you do interlinking right first off make it a requirement for your writers to link to the rest of your content add a clause to your writer guidelines that each article should have links to your other content pieces more often than not theyll manage to get of interlinking opportunities to get this to we usually do biannual interlinking runs heres how that works pick an article you want to interlink lets say for example an article on business process management the goal here is to find as many existing articles on your blog where business process management is mentioned so that we can add a link to the article firstly google the keyword business process management by doing a google search on your domain you can use the following query siteyourwebsitecom keyword in our case thats siteexamplecom business process management youll get a complete list of articles that mention the keyword business process management now all you have to do is go through each of these and make sure that the keyword is hyperlinked to the respective article you should also do this for all the synonyms of the keyword for this article for example bpm is an acronym for business process management so youd want to link this article there too step track improve your headline ctrs article ctrs play a huge role in determining what ranks or not lets say your article ranks with a ctr of google benchmarks this ctr with the average ctr for the position if the average ctr for position is google will assume that your article with a ctr of is of high quality and will reward you with better rankings on the other hand if the average ctr is google will assume that your article isnt as valuable as other ranking content pieces and will lower your ranking so its important to keep track of your click through rates for all your articles and when you see something thats underperforming you can test different headlines to see if theyll improve ctr now youre probably wondering how do you figure out whats the average ctr unfortunately each search result is different and theres no one size fits all formula for average ctr over the past few years google has been implementing a bunch of different types of search results featured snippet qas and a lot of other types of search results so depending on how many of these clutter and the search results for your given keyword youll get different average ctrs by position rule of thumb you can follow these values st position ctr nd pos rd pos th pos th th th th th keep in mind these change a lot depending on your industry ppc competitiveness click searches etc use a scraping tool like screaming frog to extract the following data from all your web pages page title page url old headline delete all the pages that arent meant to rank on google then head over to google search console and extract the following data for all the web pages ctr day range avg position add all of this data to a spreadsheet now check what your competition is doing and use that to come up with new headline ideas then put them in the title ideas cell for the respective keyword for each keyword come up with different headlines and implement the seemingly best title for each article once you implement the change insert the date on the date implemented column this will help you keep track of progress then wait for around weeks to see what kind of impact this change is going to have on your rankings and ctr if the results are not satisfactory record the results in the respective cells and implement another test for the following month make sure to update the date implemented column once again step keep track of rankings make improvements onthego youre never really done with seo you should always keep track of your rankings and see if theres any room for improvement if you wait for an adequate timeframe after publishing a post months to a year and youre still seeing next to no results then it might be time to investigate heres what this usually looks like for us audit the content does your content have an adequate word count think x your competitors is the content wellwritten do the images in your article add value eg no stock or irrelevant images is the content optimized for seo think keyword density links to external websites etc audit internal links does the content link to an adequate number of your other articles or web pages is the article linked to from an adequate number of your web pages or blog posts you can check this on search console links internal links or if youre using yoast or rankmath you can check the of internal links a post has in the wordpress dashboard posts audit the backlinks do you have as many backlinks as your competitors are your backlinks from the countries you want to rank in if you have a bunch of links from india but you want to rank in the us youd need to get more us links are your links high quality more often than not low da pa links are not that helpful did you disown lowquality or spam links audit web page does the web page load too slow think seconds did you enable lazy

ygnko2,Entrepreneur,2022-10-29 16:10:38,i became a self made millionaire at in a third world country i will share my story here i am from central america a tropical region with lots of poverty and problems since i was a kid i had the drive to put extra effort on achieving something i started selling bananas to construction workers at later selling candy to schoolmates at at i decided to study business and become either an over achiever employee or a business owner at that time i didnt exactly know which path to take while i was in university ba studies i noticed i had a lot of spare time after school so instead of wasting my time on leisure i decided to start a business i had no clue of which kind of business start also to start one that didnt require much money because i had none i met with fellow classmates that were smart and also wanted to stand out so together we decided to start a coffee distribution company we were offering coffee to restaurants and hotels but competition was very tough and we just couldnt close deals to get to break even i started noticing the first signs of a red ocean industry and how tough it is to stand out in that kind of industry my cofounders were not putting the same effort as i was and that frustrated me at a point my dorm served as the companys warehouse packing center and distribution center i was closing almost all of the sales with clients and also doing the delivery i noticed many companies offered high quality coffee but only a few offered high quality tea also in my region a coffee growing region there are a lot of coffee sellers as we live in a coffee growing country tea was always imported from asia and few companies actually focused on it i noticed there was an opportunity on focusing on tea instead of coffee i offered my cofounders to buy their shares and they agreed for them it was a relief so i started sourcing tea that was grown locally and mixing it with herbs spiced and fruits to create tasty tea blends the product was very good and without competitors so i went to mcdonalds hq and offered the product for mccafe mcdonalds loved the product and agreed on the price they also liked that i was very young my tea processing was being done at my dorm so i lacked all the licenses required to supply at mcdonalds standards so i was very sincere with the supply chain director and told him i had all the desire but lacked the money to build the proper tea facility i offered him teapots and with the teapot earnings i could buy the machinery and equipment required to supply them properly and also to get the sanitary approvals he agreed on the teapots and gave me a advance k for them i bought teapots in alibaba china for each and sold them at to mccafe i used all the profits to build the facility and it took me almost one year to finally start supplying mcdonalds while i was already supplying them i noticed the tea market was very small a blue ocean kind but actually a blue pond my ambitious goals become a billionaire at would be tough to reach staying exclusively in the tea industry i kept hustling for two years on the tea until an opportunity came to me or i came to it while i was offering tea to a sushi restaurant out of curiosity asked if the fish served there was locally caught the owner said no it comes from asia because local fish has bad quality and i cant risk my restaurants reputation or clients health giving them bad quality fish it startled me that local restaurants didnt use local fish even though we have plenty access to both atlantic and pacific ocean seemed like an obvious problem so i started to find out why what asians did right and what us central americans did wrong after months of obsessive research the problem was lack of knowledge and investment in the local fishing industry resulting in fisherman living in poverty conditions with no ability to supply high quality fish the solution was to teach them good practices and invest in a high quality seafood processing facility the cost of the solution was over in investment money that i didnt had so i decided to build a team test out our theory and provide the product to restaurants and learn form their feedback it was a lean start up mentality to start small and cheap to prove the business thesis we received excellent feedback and real purchase interest from restaurants that was enough to know it was a great opportunity and also a huge market potential for growth so i decided to pitch my way up until i could secure the funds after a year of pitching i was far from the goal securing k in a third world country is nearly impossible if you are a young entrepreneur with an idea so i started enrolling in international entrepreneurship competitions i was able to compete in gsea and then hult prize i didnt win them earned a nd place in both but it was enough to broaden my network with wealthy investors with deep pockets i secured funding early and started building the fish facility in february the covid lockdown hit us hard and we couldnt deliver what our investor expected so legal fights came with lawyers i couldnt afford while managing a borndead company while also pitching again to secure more funds to get us out of the hole our initial investor agreed to sell his shares if given roi paid k up front and semestral payments for years a new investment fund gave us a loan to pay back the previous investor and additional k for working capital very high interest rate but at least we got a runway to prove our business through time after restructuring and getting rid of internal and external bad apples we started buying processing and selling fish in may we closed with m in revenue and we will close with m revenue beyond supplying fish to local restaurants we also provide fresh fish airplane delivery to restaurants in miami ny la frozen fish to hotel chains all over america we have healthy debts now a good ebitda and a growth trajectory that will put us in m annual revenue in less than ten years we will keep reinvesting profits on capex and opex to keep up with the growth trajectory god has been an integral part of my journey lessons learned vision and goals must be clear the path can change the goals cant having a mission is key hustle hustle hustle have a great team that compliment your strengths ad weaknesses edit some redditors dont believe this so search for forbes centroamerica abril promesas de los negocios you will see my face on the cover new edit i will start providing proof of my story on my profile so all of you skeptics can believe this isnt for me its for you human confidence and trust has brought humanity to great lengths imagine that closed mentality was the same that kept cavemen from believing

qmpgla,Entrepreneur,2021-11-04 17:12:52,update years later started a candle side hustle with about to clear this year just wanted to drop in and make another update post since the last few seem to be appreciated i have provided links to the past three posts showing this progress for anyone that wants to check it out year one year two year three xb i had to briefly scan last years thread to see where i was in the business so i could give every update thats happened since thensince last year the facebook group diy candle making beginner to advanced has grown from members to membersthe youtube channel standley handcrafted grew from subscribers to and both are still growing strong and in may of this year i opened my own candle supply company west sound candle suppliesthe facebook group and youtube channel have been incredible for growing the brand and generating sales but i will say neither one are used specifically for those reasons the main goal for both is about education first and of course sales naturally come from them because people watch and search my brand and products used i will say i have followed ugaryvee advice on this one the entire time and use more of a jab jab jab right hook approach with everything i do except tend to hold back on the right hooks a little too much and end up with twenty jabs before taking the right hook not really a fun part of the journey but one that a lot of entrepreneurs deal with is divorce i spent the last two years ending a year marriage and finally signed papers this year the main reason i bring this one up is because a lot of people would throw in the towel on their dreams and say whats the point in continuing i initially started this side hustle to bring in extra money for our family and got pushback from my ex she constantly told me how weird it was for a guy to be making candles it would never go anywhere and it was a stupid idea that would never work so me trying to calm the storm i always held back and slowed my own growth i kept a balance of keeping peace at home while building the candle business in the background without disrupting that fragile balanceduring that long two years i of course moved on with my business and started to attack it much harder than i had in the previous years i also ended up meeting someone who was unbelievably supportive and really helped me grow it further now the fun partsince last year i had someone reach out to me and redesign my website which was a huge help i could not keep up with everything even if i knew how to do it all myself i had to give up some control and hand it over to someone else who was more talented than i was this also have me more time to focus on actually making candles and videos i wish i would of done this sooneri started to ramp up the online candles classes a little and get one scheduled at least once every months out which was a hit i open each class with seats and almost every class was fulli will also say that i did not ever hold back or take away my free content to transition it to paid classes people can still get everything i teach in these classes for free on youtube the group and my websitethe classes are meant to take all that information and condense it into a quick one stop place to get all that info in hours i think this has been important for my growth as well for those that cannot afford the ticket price they can watch videos and read articles at their own pace the youtube channel is still doing really well but took a bigger slump in the first quarter of the year than i expected views normally go down around this time but with the addition of more candle making channels to the space i dont think my channel is featured in the algorithm as much as it was previous which makes perfect sense with more competition out there now last year the channel made just over and this year was on track to make around k with the slow down in views i knew it would drop a little from the target along with that i have opened my supply business which is taking time and i have missed quite a few videos the past months which has also hit monthly ad sense i am still on track to make just over again which in my mind is still beyond amazing the candles are still doing really well but have slowed down with everything else going on markets still not going so i kept everything to online sales and started the year strong with candle sales ebook sales and candle classes but have since slowed that a little with the opening of the candle supply website this is another area that has slowed down since the launch of the candle supply site but even with that slow down the candle website is still making around a month with the holidays being the busiest season for candles i expect to end the year with around in sales from the candle site alone the facebook group is still going strong and a huge help to people wanting to make candles and also a big driver in sales to not only my candles and ebooks but now my candle supply company i still keep the group a place to learn and not a place to straight sell i still operate on the jab jab jab right hook philosophy in keeping it about helping and then the occasional post about my supplies for those interestednot only myself but there are numerous people who benefit from the group makers to suppliers to designers we try to keep the group a nice environment for all involved which is why i created the group in the first place some of the groups before hand had very negative culture which made it very intimidating for new candles makes trying to learn i think this approach alone is why my group has so successful we try to maintain the safe and helpful environment to new as well as advanced i cant even begin to calculate how many sales are driven by the group but its around of traffic coming from facebook in general the candle supply company kind of came out of nowhere fast and really just made sense with so many people coming to me asking what wax to use and who sells it where can i get this and that i finally wanted to say you can get them from me its always been in the back of my mind but i kept the idea growing slowly until around may i have been talking with a larger candle supply company wanting to get into the us market and they wanted to go through me to break into the market after more than a year of talking back and forth about candles and ultimately building that friendship they ended up sending me a large shipment of wicks and i created a website and started selling the stock they sent me the wick order they sent me was about and i quickly paid that off as i sold them i didnt go find investors no one helped out other than the wicks they sent and i didnt take any loans to launch this the only reason i say this is when i read stories like this it always takes a turn for me when someone says and with a loan or a gift from my dad of dollars i was able to make this all happen which is always a little defeating to hear i wanted to make this relatable to people like me who dont have those opportunities coming to them now having said that i did have someone give me in wicks but it really wasnt given at no cost to me i spent the last four years building a brand that was just as valuable to them as them sending me the wicks to get started working with each other once those wicks sold i took all that money paid the invoice ordered more wicks and took that profit to order my first eight fragrance oils once those eight fragrance oils sold for i took the profit from those and ordered eight more fragrance oils i kept that going and currently have twenty six to choose from with another eight on the way i also ordered two more types of wicks to put on the site and currently looking for more supplies to add all the time i also paid someone to develop the candle site from the start no way i was going to try and do that myself again i hired the couple who created my candle website this has not been easy at all and i am making mistakes and learning from them every day once the wicks sold they shipped me candle was melters and i began pre orders on those which turned out to be a mistake the over seas suppliers were giving me an arrival date of the end of july beginning of august so i started to take on pre preorders at the end of june of course customs issues started to really ramp up since talking about the melters and what was the first of august quickly turned into another two weeks then another week and another week and finally received the melters the first week of october i of course kept everyone in the loop who ordered one but having to tell people its going to be delayed week by week for over a month was not fun i would not do pre orders again unless i had concrete dates of arrival lesson learned for sureshipping times have also killed me and something i am working my ass off to improve i am still doing all of this by myself for the most part i get some help from my son and friends here and there but i am putting everything together pretty much myself and trying to keep up this is why i am trying to hire someone asap i need help and cant keep up with orders which of course turns into delayed delivery times which sucks i take full responsibility on this one it turned out to be busier than even i expected to this date the supply website is about to cross in sales here in the next week and based on previous months sales i am projecting to clear around in sales next year i think i can easily double those numbers adding up the supply site the candle site and yotube i know that i will clear minimum of this year and if i can really kick it into overdrive with the last two months of the year being the busiest time for candles i think i can actually make closer to this year i also just opened my first brick and mortar retail and warehouse location i am very excited about this one and i will try to attach pictures to the post the finishing touches are being put on the retail side and the warehouse side is ready to go i met with my first potential employee last night and really excited to get this goingi am still working my full time job which is in it with the plans to transition to the candles full time within the next years there are a couple more things that add to the overall numbers like affiliate links which is another a year all in all its been an amazing journey and one that has ben way more than i ever thought it would be i also have to give a huge shoutout to ugaryvee who has been the one guy i looked to for little tips and help along the way i have to say that because someone was talking shit just a while back about how his advice is bullshit and no one actually makes money from his motivational bullshitwell i for one can honestly say his advice videos and books have helped me tremendously
128lom1,Entrepreneur,2023-04-01 12:57:58,in march my niche sites made breakdown affiliate mediavine ecommerce heres how i did it i didnt im just lying didnt make a penny even if i did it would just be revenue and not profit which is meaningless please dont trust or pay attention to most of the people who post these things
15yu0h2,Entrepreneur,2023-08-23 05:12:02,i started a business months ago and its already selling around k a month with about profit margins heres how i did it i should preface this by mentioning that i originally posted this as a reply to a thread asking entrepreneurs how theyre making kmonth i figured this might help other people too so heres the scoop into how we did it wife and i mind you weve recently started out in colorado as we just moved from florida in march of this year we did the same thing in florida we own a wholesale bakery and grabandgo breakfast company in colorado my wife handles bakery i handle breakfast and juice company our product line consists of over different products which sounds like a lot but its really just a bunch of variations of cookies brownies pies breakfast sandwiches rte chia puddings and overnight oats and coldpressed juices we also cater primarily to a moreorless health and lifestyle conscious crowd boulder and denver so we offer a lot of glutenfree keto vegetarian vegan and even lowfat options this quickly adds up in your catalog i own a decent dslr camera that i use to take pictures of our products but dont let it stop you most phones take excellent pictures too and we put together a quick catalog on canva showcasing our unit price suggested retail price and minimum quantity for each item then we went on google maps and compiled a list of every independently owned coffee shop and café in a mile radius and with the magic of the internet we quickly had a prospect list complete with email and phone number we then started introducing ourselves to the shop owners and offering free samples along with a copy of our catalog once we had some interest and we knew the business had a chance to succeed we signed a month lease at a commercial commissary kitchen which is basically mo for one hour shift per week and is month to month after the first months the advantage with this route is that you get access to a fully licensed and inspected kitchen you can scale responsibly and the best of all you can call it quits after months if you dont like it or if it doesnt work out and you dont lose k worth of equipment that you cant get rid of you also get access to highcapacity equipment that you would need to borrow or spend a lot of money on like massive walkin coolers and freezers convection rack ovens qt mixers etc weve been lucky to be growing fast and weve even decided that we are not taking new customers at the moment and im only selling to about coffee shops out of a massive list of over prospects in our area and not counting anybody outside of our delivery zone were now up to days a week mo rent and weve brought in a few people to help us with some busy side work cleaning packing etc my goal is to reach around k in sales per day which i think i can achieve with my existing customer base by simply introducing some new products that they may be in need of that would put our sales at just over m per year and with our low cost and payroll this would represent around k takehome at the end of the year our bakery also has an awesome corporategifting component that makes us another k per year and around k in sales during the month of december alone holiday gifting i can go deeper into this too if youre interested this adds another k roughly in net profit every year and its normally what we save every year and how weve been able to open and explore other ideas and businesses in the past overall the main advantage that i see with this business model is that its a winwin for everyone coffee shops dont generally have licensed kitchens but they do have a demand for food pastries and noncoffee beverages think starbucks the opportunity is massive anywhere you want because there will always be a need for a specific food category that may not have a great local supplier croissants juice sandwiches readytoeat lunch and salads etc or maybe you can take some of their business if you offer a better price point or smaller minimum order also if your product is wellreceived soon enough it becomes a highlight in whichever place is carrying it and not only is the shop making more money by selling it but theyre also attracting more customers for it you make money they make money customers are happy thats the sauce really this is about as specific as i can get but im sure im leaving some things out feel free to dm me if you have more questions and ill be happy to help edit first of all thank you for all the nice comments this post definitely blew up more than i anticipated im glad my story can inspire a few people to pursue their own dreams however because this is reddit you have a few folks who are adamant on proving me wrong so i thought id share one example from one of our top selling products cinnamon rolls heres my cinnamon roll recipe cups g ap flour sams price for g cup whole milk sams price for cup ounce packet active dry yeast sams price for oz cup g sugar sams price for g tablespoons unsalted butter sams price for tbsps large egg yolk sams price for egg cups g confectioners sugar sams price for g cups g brown sugar sams price for g tablespoons ground cinnamon sams price for cinnamon if you add all these a batch comes out to from which i get buns this means to be exact that my buns come out to now by my x rule these buns would sell for retail however these buns are massive and most coffee shops are selling them for around this means that if i offer a client a wholesale discount on a case of im selling the unit for and the case for now if you want to get technical and add the expenses of the kitchen rent i pay no utilities there then sure these take about hrs to make and we make about batches at a time while also doing other things mind you so my rent cost factored in would be around rent hours a month batches so lets say my overall cost for one case of is all costs included with that said here is my margin calculator here so you can see that my margins on cinnamon rolls specifically is actually around when you add my other products it all averages out to about ill also add on here that most shops order dozen every days the places we work with are pretty busy as they are on main streets and downtown areas and usually go through the dozen daily and thats not the only thing they order most will also order cases of sandwiches juices overnight oats or pudding jars and more thanks again for reading
92onia,Entrepreneur,2018-07-28 19:17:14,if youre serious about making money then heres some ways to start today god damnit i understand this may come off as harsh but this is coming from a place of deep love and respect i know how valuable your time really is and i so desperately want you to see this truth for yourself you need some momentum to see the dollars come in and confirm that you can do it if this post helps one person take action i will be so happy theres nothing better in life than teaching someone how to fish or showing them that fishing is a skill they can easily learn to be frank theres so much bulllshit online and soo many of you are complete posers who arent serious about making money you want to make money who the fuck doesnt but you never take any fucking action i want to talk about practical ways to make money now not some long ass gameplan right the fuck now this is definitely more geared towards people just getting started as this is how i started my entrepreneurial journey personally i believe if youre serious you can start making money today otherwise you may be bsing yourself and being an entrepreneur isnt for you i know what im talking about ive sold hundreds of thousands of items online over the past years my path has taken me into a specific niche anyone here like lego so i dont do this anymore on this level but i still have such a sweet spot for the simple art of buying and selling misc things and i believe this is the key to getting started here are some ways ive made money buying and selling over the years and no i dont want anything from you i just hope this maybe helps someone get started today buy low sell high there are millions of items out there that you can make money on everything has a value i have bought many things for less than a dollar that i have resold for hundreds first of all you gotta know how to find what things sell for online how do i find items values search sold items on ebay and this will show you how much the thing is worth do not look at the current items for sale as their true value instead look to see what they have sold for in the past many people will overprice their items so you need to see that it has actually sold where do i find things to sell thrift stores check your local thrift stores a few times a week take out your damn phone and pull up the ebay app if you pick it up look it up seriously just ebay search everything maybe even hundreds of things the most random crap sells for a lot online teacups look them up old board games look em up action figures books shoes search search search usually you will want to pay less than and resell for at least i always liked to talk to the employees and tell them what i was doing over the years i made friends with them and they helped me know what new items have shown up in their shop that could be good to resell yard sales oh god i love yard sales have a game plan the day before you go out research and know where youll be driving this way you know where to go before you hit the road find community yard sales so you can hit up a bunch at once get up early my secret to yard sales walk up to the owner and ask them if they have whatever it is youre looking for if youre super nice and polite and respectful many times they will go into the house and bring it out for you this way you can be on the hunt and you can check way more yard sales throughout the day by not wasting any time looking around craigslist besides searching for items to resell try writing a post where you are completely open with what youre doing personally i think this is a gamechanger make a post under the wanted section and have the title be something like wanted anything really explain that you sell items online and you will be able to pay cash for anything that can be resold on ebay you wouldnt believe the number of responses ive gotten for this the coolest people respond and you will be flooded with options of things you can make money on people respect the hell out of honesty and theyre cool with you making money as long as youre real with them ebay you dont have to leave the house for this one make an advanced search for whatever youre looking for with buy it now and newly listed as the search options this will show you the newest items that have been put up for sale and if you search enough times a day you will eventually find something severely under priced that you can make money on ebay to amazon most people want it now so they ignore ebay and go straight to amazon because of this most items sell for way more on amazon compared to ebay you can list items for sale on amazon now and once they sell head over to ebay and purchase the item and have it shipped to the buyer everybodys happy and you keep the difference note because you never actually see the product in person you have to be careful with this one if the buyer complains you will most likely have to send their money back and take the losa alibabacom most likely youve heard of this site it connects wholesalers from around the world to buyers who want stuff to resell every fucking thing imaginable is for sale here with wholesale prices this is definitely more advanced but way easier than you may think just a random example of something you can buy and resell i found wholesale conveyor belts at each here in the us they go for theres shipping coats and fees but the profits are still excellent it takes time to contact them ask for samples and wait for delivery conveyors for example took months to arrive but there is big money here ive heard people say of items on amazon were sourced through alibaba there are definitely many more ways to get started in the world of being your own boss but i just love the simplicity of buying and selling you can start that today i hope this maybe helps somebody out there get started please please please let me know if you have any questions i dont want anything from you i just want to be a

16jg6k3,Entrepreneur,2023-09-15 15:18:13,i yo make a year with mobile apps ama just to clear it out the way this is a throwaway account so i dont care about useless karma and im not selling crappy courses or promoting any products im just a dreamer going with the flow in this world read the tldr at the end need be growing up i was admittedly a computer addict growing up and i absolutely loved video games somewhere along the line i found out about and grew an interest for finding cheats and hacks for video games towards the end of a series of exploits for the game roblox came out which allowed you to run scripts within game serversinstances this is when i first started to learn how to program i became obsessed with creating my own scripts and i was eventually able to write ones wayyy more powerful than anything publicly available at the time i grew my skills a ton during this period this was probably my most eyechanging learning experience in tech so far in life if im being honest i was programming on and off for a few years after that but nothing too significant until high school in when i started looking for freelance programming jobs no one took me seriously as a selftaught teenager who never set foot in college before but i started to ramp up my skills anyways fun fact and my biggest regret i was known as a developer throughout my school and i often had friends pitch me ideas i never took any of them seriously and one friend told me about his idea of a digital business card where you could just share a link instead of an actual business card i told him that thats exactly what linkedin is and it already exists what he was actually pitching wasnt linkedin but linktree he also pitched it to me months before a single line of code of linktree was ever even written and i had the skills to make it at the time linktree is a b company today oops the start i learned how to create mobile apps after my school offered to waive my community service requirements went to a private school for the rest of my years there if i made a landing app for them i started working on more and more personal projects since no one would hire me as a freelancer and in i released the first version of a dating app for a specific niche group which i knew were hesitant against joining standard dating apps like tinder or bumble the group made up a huge percent of the population yet there were no good dating apps specifically serving them think for example of the muslim population who dont usually date outside of their religion and who have their own standards and norms for dating and thus wouldnt usually be on tinder ignoring economic differences would you rather fight to get the billion nonmuslim people in the world if you had hundreds or thousands of potential competitors or would you specialize and fight to get the billion muslims if you only had a single digit number of potential competitors that app was semi successful and then i thought to myself okay there are many other groups that are hesitant to join tinder and i already have the core code and functionalities of a dating app why not just reskin the app add a few minor changes to the back end and just release it as a new dating app for a different niche group which wouldnt take too much extra work compared to starting from scratch close terms for this is white label app or app templates if you wanna look into it further an example of this would be if someone made a generic baby phone game app and then released a police man fireman ambulance or even justice league and avengers versions after reskinning thus casting a wider net since then ive released a total of different dating apps im projecting a return of just over k after expenses this year combined across all of them my most popular one makes kyr and my least popular one makes kyr my early traction strategies were about the same with each release prioritize user satisfaction and reviews social media marketing to relevant subreddits facebook groups instagram tiktok etc offer users pro access for inviting friends and even physical flyers at key locations from time to time just for the hell of it lol i think all of those combined were responsible for like of initial growth the rest came from a few shadier strategies and from word of mouth anywho i will note that i did go to university at the same time starting in while doing all of this and i have a bachelors degree in computer science today i had a really really easy time with it though and i graduated in only years big thanks to clep dsst knowledge is power yall conclusion i thank the stars for where i am now technology changed my life forever and granted me pretty much all the gifts i have today im pretty happy with my position in life right now since im able to just chill out and go with the flow honestly i havent been hustling or working on the apps much anymore and in return they havent been growing nearly at the same speed as expected from a high velocity tech startup today i dont have any fancy matching algorithms like popular dating apps today and the uiux and many other elements of the apps are honestly a bit dated at this point i have no workers outside of a few upworkfiverr people from time to time needless to say im lazy and i hate hustle culture im just checked out and really content to be chilling at this point in life ive always had fairly cheap hobbies inexpensive tastes and a significant lack of care for social status so my expenses and spendings arent too different from anyone elses im now thinking of going all in on rbogleheads and just wandering the earth with the returns and such cheers good luck fellow dreamers tldr made a dating app for a niche group marketed it well took the core code of the app and made other versions for other niche groups repeated the processes that led to success on the first app and allowed the apps to grow over the years ama

5ffp9j,Entrepreneur,2016-11-29 01:19:16,web design only started in jan this year making over consistently every month lots of lessons ama thanks for the massive response on this everyone i run a business during the day and wasnt really planning on this much feedback i have tried to get back to everyone best as possible and will continue to do so as best as i can why am i sharing this steel sharpens steel there isn no shortage of this work and many wont even try thats not a dig there are millions of websites and no matter how good they are now they need to be redone every few years anyway a few will try though and as i scale up next year i would love to work with those who are as driven as i am those who doubt this money need to rethink what is possible k is only one or two big websites a month these figures are not that big in the larger scale of things but its only possible if you think it is i was in the same place last year doubting i could even survive on web design but as i progressed i seen there is plenty of well paying work available again though its not easy and it is time consuming none of this is meant to sound like i am preaching but rather just to confirm its possible i hope to post on selling more tonight if possible thanks for reading so far tried to get this bold but couldnt hi guys i started a small web development company this year in january and i wanted to document my journey from making nothing for the first few months up to a steady income of over a month this isnt all profit as i will explain but its been good so far and my best month was apologies for my rantish writing and hopefully some of you get some value out of this this isnt some magic get rich formula but it is a great way to learn some useful skills and get paid decent money to help peoples businesses also the profit and skills can be quickly used to start your own business it takes a lot of work though and plenty of hours sitting at your computer just want to be realistic from the start backstory i used to work as a drilling engineer in alberta canada i am irish but when oil crashed i was let go pretty fast i decided to travel in south america for a month which i loved but i had to go back to canada and try find some more work even though i had made some good money in oil i spent it as fast as i made it and i was back to very little savings i worked some odds jobs including moving furniture for an events company and other things i got pretty sick of it and decided to risk it all and sell everything i owned nonessential and move back to south america i moved just before christmas last year and rented a small apartment in a quiet neighborhood i slept on the ground on a mattress and basically had nothing but a desk laptop and wifi connection i had never successfully made money online before and i had no idea where to start i tried instagram marketing for a month and failure miserably i did get some comments from gary vaynerchuk though which was cool i ended up doing a udemy course to build a website for a product i was working on i actually really liked the website and i found coding kind of fun i decided to give this a go and went to work months first stop was upwork which was brutal i did about months on here in total and it was pretty rough i got some good clients but most were dicks and after some kid changed his mind for the th time on a website i quit i never made more than and most websites took me two weeks to build multiple changes clients were slow kept changing their mind months after that i decided to just start approaching people i knew and i did some websites for they were mostly for small businesses that didnt have much cash flow and could not afford to pay me much the websites were okay but they werent getting great results for their owners so i didnt feel like i could charge much months at the time i was doing some legal work for canada and the person i was working with had a terrible website one day i asked her if she would want me to fix it broken pages terrible design and she immediately said yes she said she had been meaning to do it for years and badly needed it done she said name my price i picked the highest figure i could think of since i knew she had a very profitable business it took me about weeks to finish but i felt super happy about it i spent a lot of time on having it look great and making sure the images and copy text was perfect when i gave it to her she loved it afterwards i asked her if she had gone with a real web design company what price would she have been happy to pay for the exact same website her answer whoops after this job i figured out a lot of what i had been doing wrong i had been trying to get smaller companies to pay for websites that they would see very little roi on they would never be able to pay much because they just dont make much or they do make a bit but having a good website doesnt help them make more good example is a gym you just go to the nearest gym or the one someone recommends a cool website wont help too much i completely changed my strategy and started approaching larger companies that made a lot of money and were losing a lot by having a terrible website these are actually not too hard to find if people want i can cover this is another post and after a lot of cold calls and emails i started to get traction i moved from to to and after a few more up to i read a lot on sales marketing design but i still only knew basic html and css i would start off with a basic theme around and make a lot of changes to come up with a great design now i know people might be saying that isnt the best coding practice and it is not but i added a lot of value in other areas and everyone was super happy with their websites they are simple static designs these owners dont want to edit anything again for a long time but the results were really powerful one business got a over times increase in bookings value k a month in future clients directly helped an oil company close a contract for over million with a great new website portfolio downloadable brochure helped a pro athlete increase his sponsors and also get more recognition these are just a few examples but i am really happy with every one so far and my clients love to rave about the websites and the success quick recap i started with zero coding knowledge in january of this year i didnt know how to host a website i didnt know what html or css was i made a tonne of really basic mistakes and figured it all out by myself i didnt take any expensive courses had no mentors and probably only spent a few hundred dollars getting set up it took me a while to refine my niche but what i now focus on now is building simple yet powerful websites that get huge results i usually charge between k and usually have a waiting list of websites while i made good money on these websites its nice to know that the value i added is many times more and all my clients have been very satisfied i am still in the early stages of figuring this all out though so i will continue to add to this post with more lessons if people want so my humble advice on how to begin i only build custom html websites i dont knowuse wordpress except in some rare cases for add on blognews sections to my sites why most of my clients are very busy nontech people they dont want or have time to update their websites they want it built well and they want it to run itself html is a lot better for this and when done right looks way more professional and requires less maintenance imo i dont have anything against wordpress just that i prefer to use html and both work fine for what i am doing how to quickly begin with html take the html and css lessons on you can also do the js section but i didnt and have been just fine next take the following udemy course non affiliate after this you will now know how to edit and work with html themes what does that mean well there is no point creating a website from scratch that takes years of coding experience and a lot of time for each new clients luckily enough people have gone and created html themes its an already coded website where you just rearrange switch out the pictures and text and add in a few extra bits i am making this sound simpler than it is but its still quiet simple an example of a theme is here again non affiliate it just a blank slate with a certain style that you work with while this may seem like strange or cheating i thought this was how to learn to build websites its not anyone with an internet connection can create a website these days so that is not where i try to add value i add value by building a website with a purpose i aim to build websites that get results and make money or whatever they are trying to achieve for the owner its not about code its about how it helps the owner i hope this doesnt piss off the obviously good coders on here i do my best to code well but i am still learning so how do you build a website that gets great results good question so first important thing is your clients want sales not a website they dont want a website that looks amazing has cool videos and sections talks about the companies recent golf tournament or how they really wanted to do x since they were unless it helps gets sales everything must be about getting a result every page link click and action on the website is to help facilitate the growth of the company and sales lets take for example an immigration lawyer website is the goal of the site to teach you about immigration law is it to show you stats of work trade and education within the country is it to teach you about what to do when you first arrive what to pack what to expect no the whole purpose of that website is for the user to either book a consultation or contact them regarding their services which both lead to that person hiring them as their immigration lawyer now it might use some of the above points to help with that goal but it only has one main purpose everything we do for that client must help with that goal or if it doesnt help be removed once you sell results there is no limit to what you can charge and achieve so where do a lot of people go wrong the types of clients you help imagine for a second the website you build will only ever generate one sale per year maybe only one sale ever now lets go over some businesses you could build a website for client one jimmy friends coffee shop one sale is a cup of coffee or maybe if they are lucky a lunch special one sale profit profit maybe client two jimmy co travel agency maybe that one sale is a trip to paris or maybe even a round the world one year break profits on travel are slim though and the internet is really driving down those juice margins one sale profit profit maybe client three jimmy inc industrial clean up services now this website is not on the sexy side of things it wont exact be winning website of the year award or going viral on fb but one sale of a large scale clean up at that oil refinery this winter maybe to million maybe more now when it comes time to sell websites you always want to aim to get your clients ten times the results that they invest in you so lets do the maths client one you can justify c client two you can justify client three you can justify k to its the same amount of time dealing with the client same amount of time coding same amount of time hiring a pro photographer very different result now what you charge is your own choice but the above example should clearly show who to build for construction industrial services engineering oil legal medical other blue collar niches the first four are my favorite unsexy boring aggressive clients people are scared to call them which i like potnetial large contracts hey but what about tech start ups and that new app they are making a zillion dollars lets go build for them no way and here is why they are in the design and internet business they know guys already or have minimum wage slaves to work round the clock on design and websites there is no shortage of guys trying to approach the cool companies for web design you will always be replaceable and undercut by others they wont see your value your aim is to become a problem solver for large boring industrial companies that know nothing about the internet and want to deal with a regular guy to fix that website disclaimer while k a month sales might sound like a lot its not really its enough enough to invest in my real businesses and cover my basic living costs not every month is clean profit i reinvest a lot of money into education design and growing things go wrong and learning from scratch is hard work some jobs run overtime some things i have to do twice or three times or more i am not sipping cocktails on some beach while i go code once or twice a week on a hammock i have since got a bed but i still live quite humble i code hours a day and also spend half the morning at uni trying to learn spanish this is a crash course on entrepreneurship while you earn money you have to learn to sell cold call manage outsource and so on everyday coding websites is time intensive by nature if you are looking for easy money this probably isnt it if you are looking to learn about business really fast though while funding and learning how to grow your own business this is excellent just want to add that in before someone thinks this is some overnight hack plan next year i am going to focus on scaling more and bringing on some part time staff at the moment i have some copywriters and use some people off upwork and fiverr there is a lot more i could talk about but this post is huge i have posted some of this info on another forum before but i wanted to added it here since i have got a lot of value from a few posts on this sub reddit before i will answer whatever questions you might have i also have a little fb group where we help each other out no business or spamming please its just to help each other thanks for reading hopefully not too many typos st edit thanks for all the positive comments and feedback i will try get to everyone soon i got through maybe half those comments and i will hit up more later after work sales seems to be a common theme so ill expand on that too hope this advice helps i wont be proving anything but hopefully my advice shows i know what i am talking about i definitely am not a great coder but the work i do has added a lot of value and revenue to my clients so i feel great about what i have done this and other forums fastlane forum have helped me a lot over the years so its great to give back i actually had some doubts about posting here since its a big wilder than other threads but i like the pressure and it helps me step up my game ill be back later tonight to post more thanks nd and final part sales side intro note this was a simple ama i am not out to prove or convince anyone if you think k a month is some huge figure you will approach it as such it is not its big sales or small sale there are a billion terrible websites learn to sell from real resources not a quick reddit thread and you can get in on this action i know guys doing k a month with this stuff as a small team and i know people doing k a month in ecommerce k is small when i started it seemed huge but its better to try focus on how little sales really make up that figure i wont be responding to any more point lists i dont care and particular posters failures or bitterness doesnt change my reality anyway its only like people but they keep posting use that energy and pick up a phone how to find jobs when you are first starting google as for finding companies that could need a new website its very easy in fact its probably one of the easiest services to find potential customers for job formula google niche industry local town and go through the first few pages of results anything that looks below par is suitable i try go for companies that are clearly doing well but havent updated the website in years you can usually tell by the date in the footer for example i google carpet search calgary within the first few searches this site came up probably a k job nice thing is he is ranked high on google but has a poorly converting site i dont have to focus on seo or convincing him people will visit since its already on the first page all he needs now is good copy images and a clear path of desired action for customers to take i would probably start the phone call off with that you could do that all day and not run out of companies that need a better website i go for certain niches guys that probably dont like to deal with web companies a lot of the companies outside of bug cities are run by red blooded blue collar guys the last thing they want is some nerd i am a secret nerd they have to deal with i run a nobullshit web design company and know the way these people like to do deals and communicate i dont talk about migrating hosting i just simply say the website has to be moved etc i have years experience on the oil rigs and grew up in a construction family so i know how to get on well with these guys i think thats one main area that sets me apart i hear a lot of our current web guy is impossible to deal with he is really weird annoying lazy arrogant its not a tough game to be better than the rest and im only getting started you can see by some posters on any codingbusiness forum that their attitude is not helping be cool friends helpful and useful if you are stuck on this read how to win friends and influence people it works now let me show you how this works in realtime dont all call this person at once ha today like right now this guy is using adwords for immigration lawyer canada thats an expensive search go check out that site easy sale already spending money you just need to redirect it web design is the easiest business in the world to find new sales you have a full list of them anytime you search anything i have already covered what to say when they pick up in the comments below if you cant sell to people with sites this bad then please go work on that its key to making bigger money once you do a few websites and get great results it is even easier to sell slowly move up to larger and larger businesses as you move up you will need to improve on some things like invoices email communication information request forms etc but you can learn it all as it goes ways to even boost more sales sales guys on commission covered below referral or free work for businesses that promote you working the network lets say you do a website for x service in new york then when its done call every other x service in nearby cities show them your results or call every other different business that is geographically close to x service work the connections believe in what you do i love helping people and i love my websites if you treat this as some money scheme or scam people will be able to tell and you get sales if you look at this thread its like upvoted because i gave a lot of value upfront and people responded its the same with companies not everyone will respond just like this thread ha but you only need a month aim big i did just as much work for a month as i did for well maybe a little more work now but not much sales for a huge site and a small one takes the same amount of time so does emails so do calls so does hosting so does invoicing so does other things the only bid difference is design and code but that is only of a job my point is it is easier to aim big aiming big pushes you harder and gives you the reward to keep going aiming small sucks and everyday is a drag i have been there so instead of dialing the small cafe dial jimmys tow truck company believe in what you can do and what you can achieve well that is it this wasnt a here are the super secrets to it was an ama these are my best answers and i hope you enjoyed them i am still learning and still growing i mess up all the time still but i keep the show on the road if you think i am definitely wrong about x maybe i am but enough of this works to hold it all together i got a lot of great responses and i am very grateful if i was starting again i would have loved to see something like this and it probably would have saved months of time scarysaturday if you ever come to south america ill buy you a beer to cheer you up thanks everyone
1jv0chm,Entrepreneur,2025-04-09 07:51:08,unpopular opinion starting a business is easier than getting a job right now i know this sounds crazy but hear me out right now getting a job feels like a full time job in itself you spend hours tweaking your resume writing cover letters applying to roles doing unpaid assignments sitting through to interviews and then nothing no reply or a we went with someone else after weeks of waiting meanwhile starting a business has become insanely simple you can build a quick landing page with carrd framer wix or notion you can find your first customers by making posts on x tiktok reddit instagram linkedin or by sending cold dms or replying to posts where someone needs help you can accept payments instantly with stripe or gumroad all the tools are there and most of them are free or cheap you dont even need a team funding or even a full product just a problem someone has and a way to solve it of course i get that not everyone can take risks people have rent kids responsibilities im not saying its easy for everyone but i am saying that the process of starting a business today just the first step is way faster and more straightforward than going through job hunting these days with a job you need to wait for someone to give you a chance with a business you give yourself the chance you can try different offers in a week and see which one people are willing to pay for of course growing a business is hard but starting one today is faster and more straightforward than getting hired curious if anyone else feels this way
7aco1w,Entrepreneur,2017-11-02 16:28:47,finding profitable niches is not hard a stepbystep tutorial for beginners that works every time there are quite a few ways to make some extra cash online if you follow this subreddit you probably know that already youve probably also noticed that one of the most challenging parts of online entrepreneurship is finding the right niche look around and youll find tons of information about how to do the whole making money online thing whether its affiliate marketing dropshipping selling tshirts or whatever else youll find a wealth of step by step guides that can teach you just about everything you need to know about strategies that work sure theres a learning curve at play there and it can get kind of overwhelming if youre new to all this stuff but with some time dedication and perseverance you can learn what you need to know to start making a profit as an internet entrepreneur whether your goal is to bring in some extra beer money with a fun lowmaintenance little side hustle or to create something you can scale over time into a liveable sustainable income you can make it happen but you may have noticed something despite all the awesome free information out there theres one thing that at the end of the day no one can really spoonfeed to you and thats finding a niche in a lot of ways thats really the tricky part and its a central aspect of a bunch of different kinds of online businesses maybe its not universally applicable per se but niche selection is essential for such perennial rentrepreneur standbys as affiliate marketing dropshipping on shopify creating monetizeable instagram accounts and more its also important to what i do which is kindle publishing i know there are other reddit posts out there about finding a niche not to mention a million blog posts on the subject but even so i wanted to share my own inthetrenches knowledge and experience because i noticed theres a lot of bad information online i love this stuff i remember when i was starting out spending hours upon hours throughout the night and often saw the sun come up researching different niches again my experience is with ebook publishing but im also talking about broader concepts that are applicable in other entrepreneurial pursuits so heres my advice on finding profitable niches and its maybe a little contrary from what youre used to hearing over and over again so lets get started this is a pretty long post so heres a quick tldr of the key points go for profit over passion profit potential takes precedence over your own personal interest in a subject remember you can always outsource your content and copy to someone who does know a lot about the topic go for big evergreen mass market niches that always sell ill explain why and what these niches have in common focus on solving a specific problem getting in shape is a broad niche how to get a six pack in weeks or less is a specific problem autosuggest is one of the most efficient ways to pinpoint those specific problems this applies on amazon as well as on google and youtube you can also find tools like keywordshitter and answerthepublic that make it easier to find and collate that information should i pick a niche that interests me this is a pretty common question and yes i have been asked this by people quite a few times and honestly this is something that comes up periodically here at rentrepreneur ive noticed there are two pieces of advice you see a lot and theyre mutually contradictory some people will say yes go for your passion youll be miserable if youre grinding away writing content for a niche in which you have zero interest find what moves and drives you and channel that passion if youre into cars do affiliate marketing for auto accessories if youre into fashion try finding a subniche in apparel and accessories others say the opposite no matter how much you love something when you create a business out of it its going to feel like work and this could lead you to resent something you used to love dont make a business out of your passions or hobbies pick something toward which youre more neutral but that you know is going to sell so which is it both arguments honestly have some pretty good points personally i like to lean toward the second option choosing a niche based on the bottom line not on personal passion thats not to say you cant choose a niche youre at least somewhat into but heres why im more in favor of option a lot of hobbies and interests are frankly kind of hard to commodify if youre into say french symbolist poetry theres not a whole lot you can really do with that at least not at scale with some things commodification kind of feels wrong think spirituality that kind of thing this is pretty individually variable though and im not here to make any value judgments of any kind chances are youll end up outsourcing most of the grunt work anyway a quick look through rjuststart confirms that when getting started most people write their own content but as someone whos published tons of books and stuff ill say this no matter how much you enjoy writing doing it all day every day in high quantities burns you out like nothing else even if youre a super gifted writer a professional writer even youll reach a point where youll want to outsource that kind of thing why because if youre doing all the work yourself you will reach a point where you cant scale anymore for instance lets say your output is book per month and after a few months i guarantee youll want to take a break to recharge but if you are outsourcing your work you can get books done per month again my experience is in kindle publishing so im talking mostly about content info products etc but im sure itll apply to physical products creating an app etc at the end of the day the goal here is to start a business and make money for that reason it makes a whole lot of sense to focus on profitability the level of competition the potential for a first mover advantage in a nascent market and other things like that again you might have a hobby or a passion that actually does lend itself well to starting a business of some kind selling products writing a series of books about it blogging about it and posting product reviews with affiliate links whatever but dont feel like you have to start with your own interests if you dont hate it or if it does not go against your values then its fine but never go against your values because youll end up sabotaging yourself for instance i will not promote a business that is related to drugs violence or porn no matter how much potential there is because i will not feel good about doing it and i end up sabotaging myself not interested in learning about knee high and thigh high boots tailored for the thicker calves of plus size women even though theres a rapidly growing market for that kind of thing find a writer whos a plus size woman who loves fashion and wears a lot of boots during the winter get her to write up your product reviews or write up general supporting blog content like fall fashion style guides and editorials about body positivity shell gladly write for you and no offense but shell end up doing a heck of a better job than you because its what she loves and what you end up paying her is a tiny fraction of the amount of money youre ultimately going to make from that content check out my post about what kind of freelancers to avoid to save yourself a lot of headache though theres a lot you can outsource and for a lot less money than you might think so dont toss an idea just because its not a personal interest of yours the advice i give to my students is get some stable consistent cashflow going first then you can focus on your passions youll enjoy these passions a thousand times more if you do this because theres no pressure to make a profit from it youll be way more creative also do i need to be knowledgeable about my niche i kind of touched on this one in the previous section it probably depends on what kind of business youre running what your goals are and other variables that can be different from person to person but what i do want to emphasize here is that you dont have to feel like you need to be a world class expert on a subject to build a business around it dont let yourself succumb to the whole imposter syndrome thing youd be surprised what you can do with some simple googling in your free time we live in a freaking golden age of information right now thanks to the internet and smartphones you are literally holding the entire wealth of human knowledge in the palm of your hand with just some determination some free time and the magic of google search you can quickly learn the basics about almost anything and honestly the basics are all youll really need when it comes to content whether its a book youre selling or a blog post housing affiliate links what matters is that you know more than your audience about how to solve their problem someone needs to attach two pieces of wood together with a nail you dont have to be a world class authority on hammers to give them the answers they need you dont need to know about the rich history of hammers or how hammers are manufactured you dont even need to be all that knowledgeable about building and construction in general you just need to know that your audience needs a hammer and oh look you have a bunch of great product reviews of the very best hammers for their specific kind of nail or youve got a comprehensive ebook that gives a full step by step guide to hammers and how to use them to pound a nail so dont feel like you need to be a authority or expert on your chosen niche how to find a niche start with the timeless evergreen niches that always always sell when people talk about niche selection they put the biggest emphasis on specificity they focus on narrowing things down now dont get me wrong thats definitely something you should do but that step comes later before you begin you want to focus on selling what sells there are big massive evergreen niches where there will always always be a market full of people itching to break out their pocketbook and pay you for solutions to their problems now these niches have some pretty important things in common and i think its worth talking about those things what is it about these things that make them so perennially profitable it comes down to basic human desires love sensory pleasures material wealth selfconfidence social success selfactualization these desires are basically universal at least within contemporary western culture they revolve around things that people want on a very deep and fundamental level in ways theyre not necessarily even fully aware of love and friendship for the most part humans want to find a romantic partner with whom they can share both emotional and sexual intimacy someone to love them and support them social success people want others to like them this ties into things like beauty and getting in shape although that also relates to the desire to find a mate it also ties into selfhelp topics like how to be more confident how to get better at public speaking etc material wealth good old how to make money whether its investing in real estate starting a small business or whatever people are always looking for ways to make more money again this also ties into the concept of social success entertainment people like to have fun they like humor they like to laugh they like to read about celebrities or whatever vicariously reveling in the sumptuous glamour and sexy scandals of the rich and famous a lot of late th century sociologists and thinkers wrote about the concept of the culture industry think of that kind of thing selfactualization and personal fulfillment people want to feel content in their lives they want to find a sense of peace with the immanent reality of their own existence they want to find ways to create meaning and infuse their lives with a sense of purpose that makes them feel complete as i mentioned there might be some cultural variance here i am not a psychologist nor am i a sociologist nor am i an anthropologist or a historian someone more knowledgeable on these subjects might be able to weigh in here so heres a list of the specific mass market evergreen niches im referring to each of them ties into at least one of the general human desires i was talking about above mass media celebrity bios stuff about tv shows or entertainment history that kind of thing also geek stuff pop culture stuff etc think pop culture which kind of runs the gamut from trashy tabloids to comic book and tv show fandoms and everything in between everyone partakes of the mass media culture industry there are radically different audiences within it from blue collar housewives who devour the latest from tmz to sophisticated urbanites with a refined appreciation of contemporary interior design and decor to people who are geeks and proud of it guys who play dd or have an encyclopedic knowledge of star wars trivia sports stuff is in this category too even fashion fits here diet and weight loss this is america weve got a massive obesity epidemic going on were constantly surrounded by foods that are bursting with calories but that arent very filling seriously take a look at the nutrition facts on those little cans of coke and stuff its insane people are always trying to lose weight and unfortunately in most cases failing at it it can take some time to find a regimen that works for their personal tastes and their lifestyle fitness another thing people want is to get fit and get in shape this one pairs well with weight loss and dieting but its really its own distinct niche getting fit doesnt always mean losing weight self development selfhelp books are always a perennial bestseller one of the most important things we need to do in this life is to understand ourselves and sometimes even better ourselves i mean think about it none of us chose to be here and if we did we dont remember it were thrust into this world as conscious beings capable of joy as well as suffering facing down the eternal coldness of the hard problem of consciousness people look for ways to infuse their lives with meaning and a sense of purpose they look for a compass to guide them through lifes confusing twists and turns cooking everybody eats food some more others less so cooking is another perennial niche you can consider cookbooks sell like crazy believe it or not dating and relationships finding a romantic partner is another big part of human life at least for the majority of people there are also the many problems of long term relationships and marriage dealing with disagreements keeping sex interesting after multiple decades rekindling romance in the wake of an empty nest etc gaming this ones maybe a little more recent and modern than the others but it really is a golden niche i guess you could really stick this into the mass media entertainment category but i thought it deserved a mention on its own making money everyone wants to find ways to bring in some extra cash money doesnt buy happiness by any means but what it can do is secure the base of the maslow pyramid and thats really important there are more to this list but whats important here is what these niches have in common an appeal to basic deepseated universal human desires for things like love acceptance wealth and meaning so these things are evergreen there is always money to be made you might be thinking arent these super saturated and high competition sometimes but theyre also massive and broad theres plenty of room in these markets the key to niching down you might not actually need to narrow your niche down as much as people seem to think you do after all go too niche and youre faced with a limited market sure you might make some money but youll hit a ceiling anyway the key to pinpointing a subniche is to focus on answering a specific question or solving a specific problem how do i lose weight is a big thing but its not necessarily super specific there are a lot of ways to lose weight there are also a lot of reasons for losing weight and a lot of different subsections of the population of people who want to lose weight youve got people who are morbidly obese whose very lives may depend on dropping the extra adipose tissue thats slowly destroying their bodies but then youve got say women in their s who arent obese but who want to lose a few pounds like lbs or less its not a health issue for them so much as an issue of beauty confidence and sex appeal the way each of those groups goes about losing weight is going to be different their specific problems are different and theyre looking for different things so lets say you want to write an ebook and sell it on amazon kindle youve got weight loss in mind as the topic cool now you need a specific problem the power of autocomplete finding the exact questions your audience is asking so whats an example of a specific problem and how do you go about looking for them you can find them by doing some keyword research its not just for seo its also a way to get a peek into what your audience is thinking in my case the focus is on what people search for on amazon these days when people want to buy something whether its a product or a book on a subject theyll usually go to amazon directly rather than using google but in other businesses google or even youtube might be where you want to focus whether its on amazon or google you can learn a lot about what people are asking and where the demand is at by checking out what comes up with the autocomplete feature you can also check out resources like answerthepubliccom to find these questions or use a tool like keywordshitter or keywordio the latter two actually draw from googles autosuggest feature so its a quicker way of getting that info than doing it manually either way youll find queries and searches like these which are what you want to focus on how to lose weight without diet and exercise how to draw for kids how to lose weight journal how to cure a migraine sometimes theyre actually phrased in question format and sometimes theyre not but you get the picture hone in on these specific questions and searches then offer your audience a specific answer whether youre putting together a buying guide for protein shakes or youre writing a series of ebooks about weight loss and getting in shape you can maximize your profits by offering a specific solution to a specific problem this is whats worked for me over the years big evergreen niche specific problem within that niche im not the only person offering this advice or at least i dont think i am but it works i realize that this subreddit is pretty diverse not all of us sell ebooks or create monetized content there are people here with cleaning services with restaurants and bars with brick and mortar boutiques and more so my advice might not be applicable in every single case but if you want to make some extra cash online in a way that revolves around informational content this strategy has worked time and time again i do hope this was helpful to some of you guys out there let me know if youve got any further questions about this stuff updated ive been getting tons of requests if they can get a pdf file of this post my answer yes just pm me and ill shoot it over to you
43r36x,Entrepreneur,2016-02-01 22:40:42,cold calls i went from nothing to kyear solo using this process script included ama edit wow i cant believe how much traction this got im so blessed that this resonated with all of you ive been getting mad amounts of requests phone calls pms linkedin invites and more feel free to connect with me on twitter for more of this stuff ill definitely be following this up for you guys with a detailed post of how i did so well with business networking events due to the amount of requests i got for it thanks for the reddit gold and thanks for being so supportive hi guys i run a smallmidsized web development online marketing agency i wanted to share my process that brought me from customers to a soloentrepreneur making about kyear with you all because there are a lot of people out there looking to start a business or keep it going i told some others in rentrepreneur that i would give a write up on how i used cold calls to get started and push through the first years of beginning a business from nothing i have since incorporated and grown a lot and dont cold call very often however i still get into big companies through cold calls and had a meeting last week with one of the biggest fish ive ever sat in front of as a result of a cold call i just hate making them and so use this strategy infrequently i love referrals and people calling me authors note i finished writing this post and it is nearly words i put my heart and my soul into writing this for you guys maybe there is a person out there that will be inspired to take this even further than i did if that is you dont forget to share all glory to my savior jesus christ for leading me to where i am without god showing me the path i couldnt share it with you first the short story i was an emt and volunteer firefighter in california back in i was working in the emergency room of a hospital and had a really tough monday lots of death blood and more i decided the only reason i wanted to be a firefighter was because of the retirement residual income if i could do it faster another way my mind just opened to it queue my brotherinlaw coming back from a trip to the east coast and telling me about a business opportunity i started selling websites for another company which is a really terrible summary of what actually happened but its short when i started i didnt have any money to spare i had about worth of emergency fund that i could live on and my wife worked and brought in about mo after taxes our bills cost about mo so i needed to come up with at least mo to survive by selling websites i ended up resorting to the only thing that costs no money cold calls tldr make cold calls even if youre terrible like i was use my script link below record data follow up profit the idea of picking up a phone and calling a stranger to solicit them to purchase something i was selling made me feel sick i was also scared of the rejection and justified my position with every logical argument that i could think of but when youre on a time clock that ends in homelessness and starvation or failure youve got to man or lady up and do it some stats and info these are my statistics based on what i recorded i dont have excel spreadsheets of data to link only my companys existence and some old notepads with my first call logs to prove these things lol my current url is nextlevelwebcom though we are currently in the middle of a rebrand and the website may not be fully functional for anyone that goes to see it yet i talked to a person about of the time so if you want to base my stats on actual people i talked to on a cold call its actually this means that for every conversations i made website sales my conversion rate including nonanswers was i counted all nonanswers in my daily calls too i tried to make calls per day in a hour timeframe which calculates out to callsweek assuming monfri only the actual number was around in action because i got lazy some days and hurt feelings other days in addition making followup calls which dont count towards these calls per day got to be pretty time consuming eventually sometimes id make of these in a day and they took even more brainpower than a cold call sometimes due to them being a longer call the best time to call was the hours of am the hour of am was the best id typically make calls from amnoon my time to closing my first sale ended up being months i think the th call i made eventually led to my first sale i made it in november and it didnt close until midjanuary i eventually shortened this cycle to weeks month but i really sucked at calls talking to people on the phone etc at first so i needed more time and more numbers to start if this proves anything you can be absolutely horrible at this like i was and still make it happen in all the time i did calls and it mustve been thousands of them i made sales on the first call i wasnt trying to make them on the st call which is a part of my process outlined below small commitments leading to larger commitments my market area is san diego county california while there are a ton of big businesses here that make money there are many small businesses that are employees and these people were who i was trying to target at the time i was selling a website product for another company at this time mlmnetwork marketing deal the average ticket price was between each and my take was around of that so assuming an average takehome of which was common that meant that each dials would eventually net me about every time i was told no i assigned a value to it ill save you the math but at first each time i heard that word it was worth about to me when i got going each no was worth closer to each because every no led me to someone that says yes not every call ended in a yes or no sometimes it was the dreaded send me an email and give me a week to think about it which is not yes or no i was closing the deal myself because people wanted to know that they got to deal with me the idea that i was some salesperson that wouldnt care if the product i sold worked or not is an appalling idea to a business owner they wanted to know i was their account manager too which is something i carry forward in my agency now if a salesperson sells they get to maintain the relationship and ensure the client is satisfied too where i found my list to call the local chamber of commerce websites they always have a business directory that includes the business owners name their current website the correct phone number etc very good and current source of info you can start local and you can use the fact that you found them through the chamber as a positive thing just search for the site on google city chamber of commerce ie san diego chamber of commerce often times there are businesses right there and every one of them has the business owners name a phone number to call and website address to investigate further local freelowcost networking meetingsgroups i actually wasted a lot of precious time at local meetup groups most people were poor like me and they were only looking to sell not to buy or refer i found these through wwwmeetupcom id actually recommend against going to these if youre purely focused on trying to sell stuff there are other better networking events you can attend i have an entire process for networking events that has made me even more than cold calling maybe ill share that next the local business directory book that gets delivered you can even use one from last year local magazines delivered to communities googling things like chiropractors in some people have more money than others and so id spend some time creating a list from googling a profession zip code often times it produces some decent results how i qualified my list this is going to be a bit specific to my niche which was selling websites and later online marketing services to businesses however you can also qualify your list so that you are talking to more of the right people and spending less time callingtalking with the wrong people i looked at their website if the website looked old or had an old date at the bottom of the site aka when its that was a good candidate for calling if the website was newer id pass on it though if it was somewhat new this was a good candidate for online marketing services they had to be local placespeople i didnt want to be that call you get from an outofstate number because those calls get ignored local calls get answered how i documented calls results a note on this if you dont record who you called and what happened you wont be able to follow up and consequently wont make it anywhere you need to be able to follow up on people and call numbers that didnt answer the first time or youll run out of decent numbers to call i opened up a word doc on my computer numbered a list and copypasted the info if i found the info online or typed it in manually if it was from a magazinedirectorybusiness card my first notes were actually on a yellow legal pad ill get a pic of them because i still have them somewhere but digital is best crm systems are great but its more important to make the darn call and be marginally organized than to be highly organized and sit around doing crm optimizationlike a poor idiot trying to avoid making hisher calls i determined my kpis key performance indicators to be of calls made of people that answered of decision makers reached of requested callbacks or emails of appointments set of sales made i made a mark next to the corresponding number on my list for each of these things occurring i recorded the meaningful points of the conversation aka what to remember if i talked to them again and the next step if they said not right now id write to call back in months i didnt call many of these people back the goal of a cold call and any necessary followup activity is to get to a yes or to a no dont try to convince people of your products value that takes more effort and isnt what you should be doing explaining is required but convincing is something altogether different i didnt have the time or patience to try to show that there was value in a new website if they didnt see it then they didnt have any money or they were oldschool and likely going to be tons of work to convince small commitments lead to larger commitments i didnt ask for the sale right away i didnt ask for an hour of their time i didnt ask for them to meet for coffee i asked for minutes of their time over the phone if they liked what i had to say then id ask for minutes of their time to show dont leave voice mails for people unless they know who you are only leave voice mails for followup calls it is okay to call as often as times per week once per day but only leave one voicemail per week in followup it is safer to call only times per week and you should call less often as time goes on so youre not annoying id say up to calls the first week calls in week calls in week and call per week after that for followup just a general set of guidelines the most important concept i learned on my own the three boxes people have three boxes in their head that need to be checked off before they will allow you to pass the receptionist the business owner or the office manager will reject your call and not even give you an answer if you dont give them these three critical pieces of information your name you dont need to give your company name sometimes its even a bad thing if you give your company name it doesnt add credibility it just tells me that i dont know you most times id only give my first name and this was almost always fine how you found them this tells them if you have something in common or not if you found them in the chamber of commerce for example this tells them that youre local and immediately differentiates you from a random cold call look to leverage anything you can to show that you are like them if you can somehow connect on any level you get a check on this box because you seem human why youre calling and it better not be to sell something this one is really the crux of why i am different if i told someone that i was looking to sell them a website theyd get rid of me as quickly as possible ugh not another sales call i needed to give them a different but still valid reason for calling my reason was because i saw a potential fit between our businesses and was calling to talk to insert name here about it i do tell them what i am selling afterward but once i addressed the third box in this new way something magic happened people started listening i was no longer selling snake oil to make money but was offering to talk about something that would be mutually beneficial often times they would identify with me and i would get people to give me respect and honest answers many times the answer was still no but i got my answer and guess what sometimes the answer was yes and i made a sale the script finally link to the script in google docs update link to the conversation script in google docs hopefully by now you have read this and can understand why my script is this way how i followed up there is a difference between following up and moving prospects forward its a lot simpler than you might think start your followup call with a goal in mind remembering that small commitments lead to larger commitments for me i always had the same goals in my prospect funnel cold call ask for a minute conversation to determine if there is a fit schedule a minute demo even if it ends up being an hour minutes is easier to stomach for a busy business person ask for the sale after a website demonstration go over pricing pricing packages are important dont do this for custom quotes custom quote requires a modified process from what i shared meet in person over coffee buy their coffee thank them for their business get to know them and their company more and ask for referrals the end result recap i went from being months from bankruptcy to making just over by myself using the same company i sold for as subcontractors for the work which their cut wasnt included in the k in my nd year of doing this i also supplemented this work with focused business networking after a while which is a whole other word post in and of itself a few final notes i made a commitment to making calls per day days per week i know others can supposedly bang out calls a day but i dont know how you do it with any brain power my brain power was gone after about calls i would make calls in hours or less that is a good benchmark especially when starting out i was also given that advice by other successful sales professionals a note is that i counted every time i dialed whether i spoke to a person or got a voicemail i bought a pack of small beads at walmart and put of them into a cup when i dialed a number i would move bead over it was motivation once i was calls in and didnt want to finish i even wrote cheesy motivating blurbs on the cups like you can do it and keep going whatever gets you to keep picking up the phone dont let yourself get distracted you will stop making calls i guarantee it dont start doing this without an emergency fund shoutout to rpersonalfinance in place i recommend keeping months of expenses in an emergency fund account i needed mine to make it happen you need to have the memory of a goldfish you have to just forget or leave behind the negative experiences and focus on doing your best now i did not get yelled at very often which was due to the way i conducted calls explained below but it hurt a lot when i did also there were entire days that i failed on myself a few times i remember making less than calls putting on headphones and playing elder scrolls oblivion for hours straight because i let a mean person get to me nothing against gaming but this will kill your dreams i was not okay with failing on my wife and potentially losing our home but i failed that day i would pick up and continue on the next day as if nothing happened its a new day and a new chance to succeed dont get down on yourself for failures feel free to post any questions you may have in the comment section i will answer them as best i can if you want me to do an ama on building a marketing agency from scratch down the road i can if the mods want me to do it
quf53x,Entrepreneur,2021-11-15 12:17:26,canva founder was rejected over times by investors now the company is worth billion determination is one of the many lessons we can learn from melanie perkins and her journey of starting canva she pitched the idea to over investors before managing to secure a meeting bill tai and interestingly enough she met bill tai at a conference that perkins wasnt even a part of she said i spoke to him for five minutes and he said if i went to san francisco hed be happy to meet with me so i jumped on a plane to san francisco and true to his word he met with me needless to say the pitch was a success fast forward years and melanie perkins has a net worth of billion would you still be pitching to investors after unsuccessful attempts edit based on the replies i thought id share more information on canvas background and the companys journey as a startup here are some really interesting and helpful videos
56xvo1,Entrepreneur,2016-10-11 13:05:05,how we made profit slinging tshirts as a side business in i saw the other t shirt thread on here the other day and thought you guys might be interested in a completely different approach unlike the other thread where they picked a single niche and went through getting feedback testing small versions of their ideas and asking customers what they wanted my business partner and i did something completely different we decided to go after what was already selling and attempt to give customers a better design on top of that we decided to sell them on amazoncom with as little work as possible since this was a side business here is exactly how we did it we managed to hit in profit within a single year merch by amazon pod service i am sure you have all heard of other print on demand pod services out there i know a lot of shit is talked about starting t shirt companies and i completely understand why most people fail when they start one i have given half attempts before at selling shirts on teespring or other services the issue is you have to drive your own traffic which costs money and tons of testing to get it right i failed as well along with the majority of other people well late last year amazon announced they were coming out with their own print on demand service they were calling it merch by amazon all you would have to do was sign up upload designs and they would take care of printing shipping and customer service the best part was there were no minimums if someone bought design they would print that single design and ship it all you had to do was upload if you are at all interested you can sign up here it changed into an invite only program so you will need to sign up and wait everyone gets accepted but it may be some time in the future as they can barely keep up with demand the way it is you see they first thought that this program was going to be used just by developers but other people saw the money signs and it quickly was changed to invite only tier system when you first get an account you are capped at designs you must sell shirts before getting tiered up to you must sell shirts to be tiered up to so on and so forth currently the biggest tier i know of personally is where my account currently stands we knew when we signed up that we needed to increase the amount of slots we could upload as fast as possible both my partner and i had an account and tried out two different strategies he through up as many designs as he could but out priced the competition this quickly got him sales and tiered up for my account i went a bit slower but focused my time on amazon bsr more on that below quick note if you are designing your own shirts there is zero costs up front if you price a shirt at you make almost per shirt sold if you sell your shirt at you make per shirt making sales with zero marketing as you see above in the note if you are designing your own shirts you do not have to put any money up front this is great because if you have a shirt that is not selling you are not stuck holding the bag on all that inventory it also allows you to pivot your strategies if they are not working quickly you may look at the numbers posted and think why would you waste your time making per tshirt sold the answer is because you are selling on amazon one of the most trafficked sites on the internet they get so much traffic each and every day that if you set up your listing properly you will see organic sales not only will you see organic sales but you do not have to go mad with dealing with reviews like we had to with pl on amazon people feeling lost over the latest review policy on amazon will be happy to know that with merch you pay almost no attention to reviews so how did we set everything up to make sales without paying a dime to market them we based all our designs off niches and designs that were already selling there is no need to reinvent the wheel here all we needed to do was find something that was selling well and improve the design in some way to do this we look at amazon bsr or best sellers rank each and every listing that is selling at all has one of these you can find it by finding a product on amazon scrolling down to the product information and you should see something that looks like this here you can see the amazon best sellers rank for this item the bsr is a representation of how well that item is selling from my time selling on amazon fba and selling on amazon merch a good rule of thumb is that if an item has a bsr of in clothing that shirt is probably selling design every day the lower the number the more shirts are being sold each day if the bsr is around you can expect that the shirt is selling of that design daily around and the design is probably selling once or twice a week the more you sell on amazon and keep track of the bsr the better idea you will get on how it correlates to sales just remember that the lower the number the more popular the shirt is with consumers keep that in mind when doing research copyright you also need to have a full understanding that you cannot infringe on copyright with merch you may come across some shirts with a very low bsr but they might have disney characters or sayings on them you clearly do not own the intellectual property to those sayings or images so this would be infringement if merch catches you they will take that design down and send you an email telling you not to do it again if you get enough of these your account will eventually be closed so you need to be careful to ensure no sayings or characters are copyrighted you should be checking all your ideas through one or both of these websites i prefer trademarkia as they are much more user friendly and i have had zero issues since starting merch by using them trademarkia uspto finding designs now that you understand amazons best sellers rank and know that you need to be checking copyright you can now start looking for designs the goal is to find shirts with a low bsr that cannot be copyrighted this means they are selling and that customers like products in that niche you can then go on to create shirt designs that are much better than what is currently being offered and make sales you could go on amazon and start searching for keywords you could go and click on each individual shirt that pops up for your keyword searches and look at each listing to see what the bsr is you could also search for each and every name through trademarkia individually these are the exact steps that we took when building our accounts at first but it took a long time what started out as a side project ended up taking time away from multiple other projects that we were working on i choose a lazy person to do a hard job because a lazy person will find an easy way to do it bill gates so wanting to continue the upward trend in earnings without wasting our time searching hundreds of listings on amazon we came up with a better way we created our own software for the last months along with growing on merch by amazon we have been developing a way to automate the process of finding low enough bsr tshirts to improve on merch informer without sitting here and selling you on the idea we have actually been using it for the past few months to grow the account merch informer lets you search up to keywords at once take the top best selling tshirts for each of those keywords and sort them by amazons best seller rank this allowed me to save a shit load of time when coming up with the designs and then could easily combine them into a list and fire them off to my designers here are a couple of screens of the software pretty proud of what we have created so far we have not released it yet but will within the next week hopefully outsourcing designs i am a big believer in bootstrapping your own business until you can afford to pay other people to do the dirty work when i first started with merch i designed all my shirts i think i designed around before the concept could start paying for itself i am a god awful designer and can barely use photoshop but a few hours on youtube tutorials and i was able to create enough designs to start paying some bills after i knew i could reinvest the money i went out to hire some designers i know upwork screwed a lot of us over with their change in pricing structure but that is still the best place i know of to find talent here is the exact script i used to hire a couple of full time designers that are still with me to this day hey i am in need of tshirt designs in the time period of months your task will be pretty basic i will send you ideas of tshirts i want to make and you make them even better and unique for example i might send you a link of a already existing tshirt and i would need it being inspired by it and made even better and unique i will leave you a lot of reviews so that you will be able to get jobs easier in the future and this is a longterm position needed once we have done the first batch of around per day we could continue if everything looks good i look forward to doing business with you i ended up paying per design i looked at this as a zero sum game as you can get the designs for and if you sell a single design you make if you price at per shirt so i knew that even if i was spending money to outsource i would eventually make it back since i was selling on the biggest marketplace out there quick tip on getting rid of bad designers when i first tried to hire someone to design for me they stole images and straight up copied designs this is wrong and will get your merch account banned i was not able to use any of these designs when i first hired someone i let them know that they cannot use any images which are copyrighted or infringe on any copyright someone else owns then i will send them a tshirt idea that is very clearly copyright infringement if they copy it or do not change it enough to be considered free use i will immediately get rid of that designer the design may have cost me but that is an extremely small price to pay to weed out the copycats selling your tshirt business when it comes down to it this is a business and should be treated as such not just a hobby we are all here to make money i have hinted at this in the past but now it is just time to come out and say it earlier this year my business partner and i decided to sell a merch account since the platform was so new we knew it was going to be difficult to find a buyer we reached out to a few website brokers but none of them were willing to accept a merch account as the vast majority did not have any idea what the platform even was then i got in touch with my friends at empire flippers they just did an ama here by the way i had sold a site with them previously and am told it is still doing well to this day i reached out and asked if they would be interested in taking on this project and selling it for me it turns out they were i described exactly what the platform was how it works and what needed to happen to get the process started since it is not a website i simply paid the listing fee and then emailed them over all the earnings statements and documents needed to prove that we owned the account and it was making what i said it was making the account averaged about a month at that point i ended up doing a seller interview with them and got the listing posted we talked to a bunch of interested parties but finally came to an agreement and sold the account without an issue where we are today there we have it all the steps laid out by that we used to make over in with merch by amazon when you add up the monthly earnings that account was making the sales price and what my account is currently doing per month you can see the vast opportunity that is in front of us there has never been an easier way to make money online than by selling tshirts on amazon to leave you with a little inspiration here is my current account sales for the week you can see how many shirts i currently have live as well as what tier i am at good luck out there and keep pushing forward any questions just drop them below

every year people dont buy products they buy emotions over of our purchasing decisions are emotional harvard professor gerald zaltman edit because a few people asked already if you liked it i have a newsletter where i share more like this on a weekly basis marketing tools are just the tools to influence the human psyche in one way or another with psychology in its core xb i play with behavioral science psychology in marketing on a daily basis so i thought i will share biases here so you can implement them in your business today to make a few extra bucks xb delighters surprise features that go beyond customers expectations delighters are happy surprises that can make a difference they blow us away when we get it they are not expected thus the dissatisfaction and frustration of their lack wont appear if you want to achieve high customer satisfaction it might be a lot easier if you worked on delighters like some fancy packaging than by providing more regular features like faster shipping xb barnum effect the belief in vague predictions or general personality descriptions quizzes are a perfect example of the barnum effect in action they are also one of the most effective tools for conversion some marketers recorded a lead conversion rate of bonkers people turn to the quiz to get the number it gives people something to look at something to think of quizzes focus our attention on thinking about ourselves xb cheerleader effect individual items seem more attractive when presented in a group people are considered more attractive when they are in a group than when they are seen alone the cheerleader effect occurs because we rapidly summarise a group of facesimages into a representation in our heads we see it to be highly attractive because of its average facialimage characteristics xb centrestage effect people choose the item in the middle more often than those on the sides people tend to be drawn to the middle product when presented with products situated side by side the centerstage effect is even more noticeable when were buying something for someone else were more likely to use subtle suggestions when buying for someone else xb chunking grouped information is easier to remember for people chunking refers to the process of taking individual pieces of information and grouping them into smaller or larger units chunking is also a technique of breaking down big groups of information into smaller chunks that makes it easier for us to process xb curiosity gap people have a deep desire to seek out missing information add curiosity

around the character this little detail created a milliondollar story xb peakend rule people judge an experience by its peak and how it ends create an emotional peak purposefully doesnt have to be expensive you can easily create positive peak experiences with simple actions like using peoples names remembering important dates or simplifying a process xb noble edge effect people tend to respect socially responsible companies when companies demonstrate genuine social responsibility they are rewarded with increased respect and greater profits this has been a popular trend in recent years as social responsibility has become more mainstream xb ikea effect people place a higher value on things theyve created themselves in betty crockers instant cake mixes arrived they werent successful at all they put psychologist ernest dichter on the case turned out homemakers didnt feel invested in the baking process and put no value in the product their response they replaced powdered eggs in the cake mix with the requirement to add fresh eggs by adding one more step they had the person invested and the cake mixers sales went up they gave the baker more ownership in the result xb nostalgia effect the feelings of nostalgia make us more willing to spend money nostalgia or sentimentality brings feelings of social connectedness social connectedness decreases our desire for money thus making us to spend more xb the zeigarnik effect people remember incomplete tasks better than completed ones the zeigarnik effect is a psychological phenomenon describing a tendency to remember interrupted or incomplete tasks or events more easily than tasks that have been completed zeigarnik effect pushes audiences to crave completed stories resolved problems answered questions and achieved goals xb underdog effect people tend to support the side that is expected to lose over the favorite when your competitor is much bigger with access to great resources your story as an underdog might be of great advantagenote works best if the competitor doesnt have a good reputation xb ingroup bias people believe in their own groups superiority to any other ingroup bias is our tendency to favor whatever group the person associates herself with at a particular time apple customers are a great example of a wellbuilt sense of community among apple users heres to the crazy ones the misfits the rebels the troublemakers the round pegs in the square holes the ones who see things differently theyre not fond of rules you can quote them disagree with them glorify or vilify them but the only thing you cant do is ignore them because they change things they push the human race forward and while some may see them as the crazy ones we see genius because the ones who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world are the ones who do steve jobs xb recognition over recall memory for recognizing things is better than memory for recalling things on your website you want to make sure the objects and operations a user might want to use are visible on the screen so that they can always recognize them rather than having to recall them xb weather effects weather affects our mood and our decisions using weather targeting tools like weatherads users can set automated ads to be released under specific conditions some brands by matching ads with the current weather exceeded its campaign goal by xb novelty effect people seek out novel experiences the novelty effect is our tendency for a constant small improvement to things not because of any actual improvement in learning or achievement but in response to increased interest or competition the novelty of a new feature might bring in new conversions some tests showed a increase after introducing a new checkout design but after time the novelty will wear off and show the true effectiveness of a new feature or product xb thats it im happy to answer any questions regarding emotional marketing branding xb if you liked it

2h1mlt,Entrepreneur,2014-09-21 16:43:39,the inner workings of a subscription box company from a k site purchase on reddit to close to in revenue in less than months how we did it and whats next tldr i bought a site on reddit for k partnered with another redditor and together we spent months completely retooling the business we followed this up with months of marketing and were now less than days away from k in revenue this is a post on how we did it read time minutes grab a cup of coffee and get comfy ill get right to it the inner workings of a subscription box company so about months ago i came across this thread from a guy looking to sell a website he owned i contacted him and found out that it was wetshaveclubcom a wet shaving subscription box i felt like i could make it work given the fact that dollar shave club had proven out the model ok lets do it this was the extent of my analysis on this the site owner sent me a screenshot of his revenue i offered about x his monthly profits and we wrapped everything up that same weekend we skipped the usual back and forth dance people go through when theyre buying websites i sent over the money he sent over the passwords and that was that i reached out to redditor ukaster who i had been talking to on skype for some time he had read my original series of posts followed it to launch and grow a local business to kmonth sold it and spent a few months in costa rica on vacation we had never met but i felt like he would be the perfect person to work on this with me this is a guy that does not play around when an opportunity presents itself case in point a few weeks later he was in his car for a day drive from california to the east coast so we could work on this kevins facebook post as he was hitting the road ok so heres what we did to get moving step website rebranding the original website needed some work and we set out to change the look and feel of it design is critical and even more so with a consumer product where emotion is a large component of the buying decision click to see of our branding efforts step expanding the product line and raising prices so the original service only delivered soaps and at a price of per month we felt that we had to double that price to make this worthwhile in order to do this we had to expand the product line and provide more value click to see how we expanded our product line step box rebranding since we were now shipping more products and we had rebranded the site the next effort was to find a box that worked we called around to different box suppliers and had them send us samples we settled on salazar packaging we sent them our box design and they got on it click to see our box rebranding efforts step increasing prices and adding annual option everything so far took us about months of ballstothewall work but things were starting to shape up we were then able to increase prices to for the monthly box instead of we also added an annual version at a reduced monthly rate to see if people would prepay for an entire year and they did click to see our new pricing options step marketing so with our conversion rates up and our box at a higher price point we were able to unleash the hounds youll see that most of what we do is completely free marketing mixed in with a few paid sources click to see how we drive traffic step ordering warehouse and shipping so with the results of our efforts we needed space we were shipping from our living room and while i had a small office there was no way we could do it from there any longer so we found an officewarehouse moved in days later and got everything set up click to peep the warehouse bonus our new office so the result of all this work were going to hit k in revenue in the next days and just passed k obligatory screenshot we did k last month cratejoy screenshot have pretty awesome analytics btw and were on pace to do k in september we think we can hit our first k month in months and join the ranks of ubandholz from beardbrandcom dude knows his stuff and i respect how much he shares with the community in some ways i think were cut from the same cloth hes just smarter and better looking what comes next were launching an accompanying ecommerce store this way when folks find products that they like in the box they can order more of them in addition we can expand the product line a bit to include additional grooming products and other mens accessories click for a sneak peak of the upcoming store takeaways from all of this this is hard work and we made a lot of mistakes and will continue to make more were working every day on providing a better customer experience and trying to improve the product line we went into this not knowing a thing about selling and shipping products logistics inventory warehousing or even wet shaving for that matter but we live in the information age anything under the sun can be figured out if youre resourceful enough and willing to bust your ass until you make yourself an expert in that thing were not well connected nor do we access to a gazillion dollars in vc funding we just work hard and were just getting started the companies that made this happen cratejoycom for our subscription box web platform awesome service and amir rocks salazarpackagingcom for our box great to work with sonicprintcom for our inserts karen is the bomb designscom for our design work i wish i owned this company ulinecom for our warehouse shelving and box fill their delivery speed is insane shipstationcom integrates with cratejoy to handle our shipping this gives us life endiciacom integrates with shipstation so we just print labels from our computer the truth stripecom payment processor you already know perfectaudiencecom retargeting works well roi positive and helps with branding too kabbagecom line of credit surprisingly smooth experience gleamio contests super awesome set up and easy to add virality to your contests through sharing teambeachbodycom haha we do insanity every morning before work thanks sean t if youve made it this far props this is where the case study ends but if youre interested in taking a look at the mindset that has gotten us to this point read on launching something i read almost every frontpage thread on rentrepreneur and have done so for the past years so i know a lot of folks are stuck right now with coming up with something to launch heres what i would do if i wanted to start a new business today and had no idea what to do next check your bank account for something youve spent money on in the last months bonus points if its a recurring service of some sort your customer lifetime value is instantly boosted and you can thrive even with a high customer acquisition cost either way you know its something that people already spend money on this simple rule eliminates fantasy ideas if i get enough members ill figure out how to monetize it later later never comes so ideas like these dont get a minute of my time the only things i work on are things where i can make money starting on day one narrow down the list to things where a lot of people are making money in that industry competition is good i know this goes against everything youve learned somewhere but the more thriving competition you find the more money is being made and the larger the market join the party throw your hat in the ring and be at least as smart as somebody there most people search for a great idea with no competition without realizing that this makes it almost impossible to start something narrow things further to something that can be delivered with a simple but well designed website that cost no more than a months salary if its a product youll then have to find someone that will let you resell his or her product if its a service you simply have to find someone that already provides that service in both cases product or service youre just reselling something and with a welldesigned website youll double your chances that your supplier will feel comfortable enough to let you resell their thing yes good design is important for both your customers and your suppliers dont launch with bad design mvp or not when you get that yes from a supplier make sure you set things up so that youre not in the customers way make things as easy as possible for them to do business with you seriously remove all hoops they should be able to do business with you as easily as they do business with amazon if you dont need that extra field on the form get rid of that shit as easy as humanly possible market your thing until you pass out if your thing is something that really speaks to a persons identity like grooming fashion makeup fitness etc you can kill on social media twitter instagram facebook youtube if your thing is more detached from a persons identity like say a car wash or home cleaning your best conversions will come through search adwords seo yelp a few additional thoughts i think that a lot of startup best practices work well for people that have access to funding for the rest of us some of the generally accepted ideas end up pushing folks further away from launching something consider validation validation in my opinion is for fantasy ideas if you stay away from having to come up with an awesome idea you wont need validation in the first place there are plenty of things you can do that other companies have already validated for you and when you find that thing stop worrying about competition competition is the validation competition stop measuring this by quantity one of the first things youll hear is the market is oversaturated this is meaningless yet this single phrase has stopped more potential entrepreneurs in their tracks thanwell i honestly cant think of anything that beats this start looking at the quality of the competition instead and youll often find that the market is saturated with a lot of bad players and theyre making a lot of money despite being so bad this is the perfect situation business plans this often ends up being a way to push action further down the road if its longer than one page youre wasting your time download something like this fill that bad boy out and get to work llcincorporation unless the company can pay for it its not happening so this only happens after the company is making money one more excusegone business analysis demographic data market analysis the economic outlook blah blah blah more ways to kick the can down the road and to feel that youre doing something when youre really not i just get to work if a lot of people are making money doing this thing the startup cost is low and there is no sorcery involved it can be done fear of your idea being stolen ideas hold little intrinsic value without execution however you can start to extract value when you get feedback on it massaging it push and poke it and really run it through the wringer and the only way to do this is to tell people about it this goes against our most basic instincts because were fearful that our ideas might be stolen well the reality is most people are sitting on the bench with a gazillion ideas of their own that they are not executing on you just added one more to that list either way if an idea cannot survive competition its probably not that good in the first place in addition what happens when you launch you cant run a business without telling anybody about it youll often get this response but ill lose my firstmovers advantage well good i would never want to be the first mover anyhow first movers bare a tremendous cost in educating customers most of us dont have the money to bare that cost the folks that are second and onwards can just slide in and benefit from all of that work for example i dont have to explain the concept of a subscription box service sending you shaving equipment every month most people already know what this is thanks to dollar shave club bottom line try to get over this stuff find something youre passionate about nah son find something that is viable im passionate about table tennis but im not looking to turn that passion into a business when it comes to business im far more passionate about providing a good productservice that has good margins than about being able to marry that business to any hobby or other exciting pursuit i may have in my regular life this way im free to work on the best opportunity that arises without limitation and honestly quite often the least sexy industries are where the big money is being made so while most of the brainpower is busy chasing sexy mobile apps and such you can make bank by selling ugly widgets or providing basic services its tough to pay bills with app downloads a note to engineers and consultants resist the urge to complicate things for technical folks it seems like the inclination to complicate things is overwhelming so a problem like find people that need lawn service and connect them with people that provide lawn service becomes well how about we use zillows api to pull a picture of the lawn and the customer confirms it by drawing an outline of the area to be serviced and we tie that into google maps and feed everything into a pricing algorithm and on and on unfortunately many of these guys do not make it more often than not simplicity wins get out of the customers way start something small to get practice you dont get good at running marathons by reading about running marathons and you dont get good at business by reading about business you get good by doing and doing it over and over again but just like you wouldnt expect to win the first marathon you entered why put so much pressure on yourself to win at the first company you start or worse yet paralyze yourself with fear into never running at all because youre afraid you wont win it doesnt make sense with marathons and it doesnt make sense with business so while a lot of folks overanalyze every minutia about the thing people like kevin and me would have already downloaded a training regiment bought a pair of shoes and hit the bricks what if i fail nothing happens its literally the most mundane nonevent imaginable i spend a day or two wrapping up any loose ends head to the movies or do something fun and by the next day im already figuring out what the next thing is my personal experience hasnt been trywin it has been more like try fail try fail try fail try fail win win win win with each failure you get better and then things just start to come easy dont be afraid of failing its like the best and cheapest mba youll ever get naysayers if youre doing somethingi mean anything youll meet them whether its in real life on the internet or wherever else sometimes its even your friends and family i keep an imgur album of the best ones i come across sometimes for a little motivation and sometimes just to look back and smile for example recently i mentioned in passing that my next big project will be a restaurant and i already have a list of comment screenshots explaining why i wont succeed heres one of my favorite ones from a few years back when i was making k per month from what was a new company at the time this was the top comment on hacker news that little company now pays me a figure salary what intrigued me about this comment was the fact that it was so thoughtfully written this wasnt a troll this was someone that provided a seemingly wellreasoned analysis of where he thought i would be in months complete with business school type analysis barriers to entry competitive landscape etc so why is this important because this is exactly what many of us do to ourselves we have a naysayer living permanently inside our heads that is constantly appraising and analyzing every business idea we entertain and the analysis sounds just as reasoned and well thoughtout and measured as the one i posted above not a bad thing on its face but the guy in our head typically skews negative shut that dude up or youll analyze and over think and whatif every single idea until you convince yourself it wont work over time this messes with your confidence and you end up paralyzed say what you want about the guy but kanye was right about this most people are held back by their perception of themselves its a brutal feedback loop at some point we have to just say fuck it and get to work okay peeps hope this was helpful to at least one person oh and for making it this far even if you skimmed ama edited to add our facebook group where we continue this and other

m0n5x6,Entrepreneur,2021-03-08 19:02:33,if you live in a boring midsized town you could be making kweek with laser tag this is side hustle money but requires an initial investment between kk ill break down some expenses at the bottom who is right for this someone that has decent customer service skills and likes interacting with the general public if youre like me and live in a town where there isnt a ton of fun stuff to do for young people laser tag might be a great opportunity if youre also like me you probably have memories of playing in a dark dirty laser tag arena being rushed around with older kids and malfunctioning equipment but if thats what you think of laser tag be a little more open minded this is about providing mobile laser tag equipment for parties what i like about this hustle is that you can maintain your costs low youre not going to rent out space from a mall youre not going to need employees acquiring customers for me is completely through social media ads and google ads when i first started planning this out i felt really motivated because i didnt see any competitors nearby i was actually wrong about that i later found out that there are two local competitors and an additional one that overlaps my area what the competitors are doing wrong bad marketing bad equipment when i said i thought i didnt have any competition i mean that of my competitors two of them have websites neither are mobile optimized to make matters worse they have some of the worst photos ive seen you have to really try to make laser tag look boring and they have managed to pull it off the third competitor doesnt even have social media but he does have a gmb listing and some of his clients have posted photos and reviews ive noticed the parties hes working seem to be younger kids so i suspect he has a connection with a child care facility for me putting together a proper wordpress website was quick and easy what did take more effort and a bit of cash was photos and videos i found a photographer that was willing to work with me relatively cheap the subjects of the photosvideo were my young cousins compensated with lunch at chickfila this not only provided website content for me but i also use these exciting action images of kids playing laser tag in my social media ads i think this is really crucial i feel like it gets overlooked when people on this subreddit talk about ads there is a lot of discussion on the technical aspects but the actual ad itself has to convey whatever youre selling and i think we succeed at selling fun when it comes to keyword targeting you probably dont want to assume people are looking for laser tag parties theyre not you want to be found when they search for things such as birthday party entertainment when it comes to advertising on facebook you have to know how to target parents moms tiktok is something we havent tried yet but will likely be doing very soon primarily im interested in marketing directly to the kids and getting them to ask their parents to book a party for them also something im preparing to do is eddm im going to target wealthy neighborhoods with a compelling offer the second thing my competitors are doing wrong and whats going to cost you the most money is getting good laser tag equipment there are tons of options out there and im not going to shill for any company but i would recommend you stay away from what you might find on amazon i cant emphasize enough you dont want to go cheap here you want gear that will be durable and connected yes the internet of things has reached laser tag bluetooth and wifi are features that some of this equipment has i recommend it you also want some type of easy to carry barriers for more gameplay options this you can go cheap on the money depending on where you are will impact prices you want to aim for between sessions should be minutes if you want to get some clients during weekdays youre going to have to offer lower rates on those days costs after acquiring equipment your costs will be advertising transportation and insurance theres a lot of possibilities here depending on where you advertise what you drive and what kind of policy you get for me this is roughly month edit have been considering starting a league with tournaments just curious if thats something you guys would have been into when you were younger edit okay a couple of you have convinced me to look into franchising i am going to have to research corporate owned franchises

e9830y,Entrepreneur,2019-12-11 14:54:54,the ladders of wealth creation a stepbystep roadmap to building wealth this summer i wrote a post on growing my software company to m arr reddit thread that you all seemed to enjoy so i thought id share my latest writing back when i did web design people would often pitch me an idea for a business that would be uber for x or facebook but for y and i always struggled to explain how what they chose was an insanely difficult business and all the skills they would need to learn in the process this article is my first draft of an attempt to lay out the roadmap to building wealth and the pitfalls and principles youll encounter along the way id love to hear what you think in the comments in college i first heard jason fried from basecamp talk about how making money is a skilllike playing the drums or pianothat you can get better at over time that resonated with me immediately i wouldnt expect to be able to sit down at a piano for the first time and immediately play a concerto we could outline the progression to mastering a musical instrument so we should also be able to do the same with earning a living what lessons do you need to learn to go from odd jobs around the neighborhood to owning a real estate empire from working as a freelancer to selling your own digital products what about from working at wendys to owning a saas company earning over million per month that last one is my own path theres a reliable progression that anyone can take to earn more and build wealth in fact i like to think of it as a series of ladders side by side each one can climb to different heights in both the quality of business and potential earnings ladders of wealth creation diagram this is important and explains the concept visually in this model the potential earnings increase the higher up each ladder you climb they also increase as you move left to right to more advanced ladders but the difficulty increases with each move as well each step requires that you learn new skills to overcome those new challenges lets break down a few of those skills and opportunities at each stage time for money our first ladder is trading time for money this is how most people you know earn a living it may start with an hourly job working for starbucks but then transition into a salaried position working at a company at the most basic level you need the skills of showing up consistently being reliable learning new skills on the job every job even the most entry level require those three things then in order to take the next step up the ladder you will need to specialize in certain skills design copywriting legal becoming a nurse etc to gain a salaried position your own service business if you choose to make the jump to the next ladder of running your own services business theres an entirely new set of skills you need to learn that build on the last step things like setting up a company finding clients creating proposals pricing services hiring employees establishing an online presence accounting finance business operations etc looking back there are so many things that seem easy and intuitive now such as filing for an llc with the secretary of state that were daunting to me at the time this is also where many business owners expand beyond their ability and start to lose the lessons they should have mastered from the previous ladder like being reliable and showing up consistently which is how a friend of mine with no plumbing experience bought a small plumbing company and doubled revenue in the first year with two simple changes following up with customers doing what he said he was going to do as business owners we underestimate just how much there is to learn so we get overwhelmed and start dropping the ball on the basics productized services up until now each sale has been made by talking to customers or an employer directly in person or over the phone or email but to truly reach new levels of income you need to learn a different lesson how to sell without ever talking to the customer our goal is to scale sales to new levels that means removing every possible bottleneck on the productized service well remove the sales bottleneck then on the next ladder well remove the product delivery bottleneck a productized service is when we take a set offering eg search engine consulting and bundle it up as a set offering with a fixed price an seo site audit for a few examples include a designer moving from designing websites at per hour to charging a for designing a page website a video editor charging per video instead of per hour a handyman charging per visit rather than an hourly rate because the project scope and price are fixed the service provider will make more on some projects than others but the profits will average out on this ladder we need to learn writing sales copy that can make a sale without talking to the customer designing a sales page or hiring experts to do it for you processing online payments standardizing systems to deliver repeatable quality with each service if you choose to move further up this ladder you can add recurring revenue and employees to scale further and add predictability for example my brotherinlaw daniel used to edit any video for per hour but now hes launched a recurring productized service to edit up to four vlog episodes per month for first he answered the question how many hours will this take by moving from hourly to a fixed per video cost then he clarified exactly who it is for by specifying vlogs rather than just any video and finally he made it recurring by moving to a monthly price rather than a per video price now he has a predictable income stream from a handful of clients and a waiting list for those who want to sign up when he has more availability selling products a productized service works to remove the manual work from making the sale and selling a full product continues that trend by also removing the manual work from delivering the product physical products fall into two categories handmade and manufactured handmade handmade products are great to get started because you can make a few without spending a ton of money but then they are closer to productized services in that each one takes time to make so you cant scale seamlessly yourself manufactured manufactured products are hard to do at a small scale but if you can sell enough of them you can make them in bulk and then you can scale an impressive business a product takes far more work to create up front but then each individual sale and the fulfillment of that sale happens without much or any additional effort from the business owner examples include an ebook on how to learn a new programming language a video course on new cooking techniques a new tripod for vloggers at this stage there are an entirely new set of skills you have to learn in order to sell products in bulk customer support at scale gathering customers at scale supply chain if its a physical product fraud as nefarious people use your site for credit card testing and more thats just a few of dozens of skills youll need with that intro to the ladders of wealth covered lets turn to principles that will help you navigate this new concept principles to grow your wealth and income over time extra time and money need to be reinvested you can skip ahead but you still have to learn the lessons from each step apply your existing skills in a new way to build wealth theres a difference between working for a better wage and truly building wealth using an earlier rung on the ladder to fund the next one moving between ladders often means a decrease in income each step is easier with an audience it takes longer than you think but the results can be incredible extra time and money need to be reinvested on a recent trip to seattle i talked to my uber driver between seatac and downtown seattle the conversation ranged from travel our favorite islands in hawaii his love for music and gadgets what he does for work and why hes driving for uber on the side he has a solid career working downtown for the city of seattle and uber allows him to earn a little extra on the side driving a couple mornings a week its fantastic that services like airbnb and uber allow those on with a set salary to earn more on the side so what was he spending this extra money on well he loves gadgets and wants two things to replace a broken speaker in his home theatre system to buy a dji mavic drone those are both super fun purchases and its great hes able to work extra to make those happen but it reminded me of why most people dont build wealth increased earnings never go into wealth all across society extra moneywhether from a raise or working extradisappears into lifestyle inflation or temporary purchases when it could be put to work so much more effectively the drone would be really fun but there are so many small parts and fancy electronics that its bound to break after a couple yearsand thats if you dont fly it into a tree before then if you want to build wealth that thousand dollars should be spent on new skills or invested in the stock market retirement accounts or another business rather than burned on the latest gadget you can skip ahead but you still have to learn the lessons from each step at convertkit we run one of the largest affiliate marketing programs of any saas company bringing in nearly half a million dollars in revenue each month but its a pain none of the software available to manage these systems works well and as a result we spend at least one day a month doing manual work my brotherinlaw philip saw this manual work and decided to build a better platform for saas companies to run affiliate programs his new tool called linkmink is gaining traction but still early after working on it for nearly two years he cant help but feel frustrated he and his cofounder are only at a couple thousand a month in revenue i can relate to this years into starting convertkit we were at the same level it sucks how slow saas can be but then i started thinking about philips path hes got a bachelors degree in business has worked as a designer then as a software developer then he started working on linkmink his path has been hourly work for a company in a wide range of jobs as anyone joining the workforce has salaried work at a company both as a designer early on then a web developer okay so far this is great on our incomeearning ladder he has gone from the first rung to the second and done it quite quickly in just four years going from an entrylevel position to a fantastic salary somewhere in there he also did a little bit of contract design work so he picked up the basics of invoicing finding clients and marketing your services so lets look at his next step which was too start linkmink starting a softwareasaservice app isnt the next step on the spectrum hell its not even in the next steps running a saas company is incredibly hard with so many moving pieces development servers customer support legal payment processing etc no wonder its taking a while its not that he cant do this or that he even made a poor choice in jumping to this step simply that he has a lot of lessons to learn and he chose to learn them all here rather than slowly in incremental steps throughout the journey because of that he should set his expectations that this will take longer and feel harder than it does for other people those downsides are balanced by the fact that it can also have an incredible reward because recurring software is one of the greatest business models on the planet which is why acquiring companies and investors will pay an incredible premium to own them apply your existing skills in a new way to build wealth my friend patrick bought a house that needed plenty of work and immediately dove into renovating it himself since he works construction fulltime he was well equipped with the skills to transform this fixerupper but the real magic and value wasnt in the main house which he is remodeling for his family but in a detached car garage that is accessible from the back alley originally this building was so run down that you wouldnt even park a car in it but after months of work on nights and weekends patrick renovated it into a beautiful little square foot studio apartment just a couple hours after listing it for rent on airbnb he had his first booking his first month booked up immediately generating over in revenue when combined with his job working on a construction crew this new revenue stream was a increase in his monthly earnings because airbnb already exists he has a product to sell a cozy place to stay in an existing marketplace to a steady stream of buyers the best part is that not only is this making him money while he works construction and that the extra work he put in will raise the resale value of his house but really that for as long as he holds on to it he has steady cashflow to more than cover his mortgage no matter what job he does theres a difference between working for a higher wage and truly building wealth while i love working on the computer and creating digitally often i want an escape from that and to see projects come together in real life like many people ive been fascinated by tiny houses for years so this year i decided to pull the trigger and build one myself while its been a lot of learning and quite challenging at times the break from sitting in front of a computer to start creating in real life has been so rewarding since im a complete novice when it comes to home building ive relied on experienced friends like patrick for the trickier parts such as installing a doubleswing french door after finishing his own tiny studio and helping me build my tiny house patrick said maybe i should quit my construction jobwhich is something hes wanted to do for a long timeand build tiny houses for other people while its a solid idea and would certainly be more fun than working for a construction company i talked patrick out of it not because i want to crush someones dream but because it would be a step backwards on our earning a living ladder patrick was on the first ladder of hourly or salaried work for a company the next logical step would be to start his own company doing similar work that actually takes him to the next ladder then if he were building tiny houses specifically he could specialize and sell them more as a productnot just labor for x dollars per hour but actually selling the completed tiny house for a fixed price which would mean any efficiencies gained would be his to keep wait those all sound like good things and steps forward so why discourage it because patrick actually has a solid footing on a much more advanced ladder selling products his airbnb is selling a product into an existing marketplace hes making money while he sleeps so instead of using his time and skills to create another hourly or project based income source he should build a tiny house for himself put it on airbnb and double his product revenue use an earlier rung on the ladder to fund the next one the one downside to jumping ahead is that it often costs money before you will get money back because he did all the work himself patricks studio renovation only cost about while its a great return is a lot to come up with in the same way patricks biggest obstacle to running another airbnb unit is actually initial capital to get started through buying land and building materials thats where the early rung on the ladders can help you might stay at your software job longer to stockpile savings to fund your living expenses longer or you might pick up extra shifts as a bartender to help save for your next set of building materials which is what patrick did often it requires extra work on one rung of the ladder to fund the jump to the next one when is it worth it to work for a wage you may have heard the quote you shouldnt trade time for money while true that there are better ways to build wealth early in my career i found that advice quite discouraging that was the only way i knew how to make money and apparently it was wrong you should trade time for money especially early in your career when its the only option available with your current skill set so rather than writing off entire methods for earning a living lets break down five examples of when you should trade time for money when you are just getting started early in your career the important thing is to make enough to pay rent and buy groceries dont look down on any job that allows you to do that once you have a stable foundation you can start to pursue better opportunities when you are learning a new skill if you can get paid to learn a new skill that will grow your earning potential you absolutely should lets say i want to be a youtuber and are just getting started working as a camera assistant for an ad agency would be a great way to learn more about cameras and video while still paying rent as a step in getting to a higher rung or on to the next ladder it always takes time money or both to move to a higher rung on the ladder if you spend conservatively and save any extra money you can have enough to buy the tools training or time necessary to get to the next level to build relationships and find mentors the right people will shape your mindset and opportunities you should absolutely trade time for money if it means expanding your network to people who can help you jump to the next ladder when the work is rewarding and meaningful in its own right if you found work that you find meaningful and fulfilling you should do that even if some expert says you shouldnt trade time for money a lot of money is far from the only kind of wealth the most important thing is that you arent just treading water as you work for a wage as much of that money as possible should be saved and invested to help you jump to the next ladder moving between ladders often means a decrease in income i hope this has been helpful and inspiring so far because im about to hit you with some bad news while income increases as you move up any one ladder it often decreases when you jump between ladders sometimes that drop may be only for a few months other times it could be a few years let me give you an extreme example in i earned over from selling books and courses on design my income head been steadily increasing for the last few years and i was damn proud of my blog and business but then i decided to make the leap and switch from selling ebooks to starting a software companyone of the most difficult rungs on the product ladder my income immediately and substantially dropped as i focused on convertkit so how long do you think it took to set a new one year income record a year two years nope i didnt earn over in a year again until years later software can take a long time to get going and for years after we got traction i still reinvested everything now because of the exponential growth of convertkit more on that later im now earning far more than my previous record of as you eye the next ladder to make the leap from a stable job to freelancing or from a successful freelancing business to your next product plan for a valley to follow your current revenue peak this is especially hard when youre used to being successful in one area and then you start over in a new area and lose the signs of progress and forward momentum it doesnt have to be all or nothing you can start your blog while still helping freelance clients build the habit of writing while you still have your fulltime job or do what i did and use book and course revenue to help fund building a software company a side project is an incredible way to bridge the gap and cover the dip as you move between ladders just one note i said a side project not side projects its so easy to get carried away with dozens of exciting ideas working on each one as motivation and inspiration are there but if you keep that cycle going its so easy to be spread thin between so many projects that will prevent you from making any one of them actually successful each step is easier with an audience while the dip is always going to be frustrating imagine that instead of making the leap alone you had dozens hundreds or even thousands of people cheering you on at each stage each person enjoying hearing about your journey and eager to help you make the next step sound too good to be true its not its called an audience by sharing your journey publiclyand inviting friends family and complete strangers along for the rideyou will create your own fan club who are actively rooting for your success thats exactly what i did when i made the jump from selling ebooks about design to starting a software company i talked about the entire journey through what i called the web app challenge a public challenge to build a customerfunded saas product from scratch to in recurring revenue in six months while i didnt hit the goalonly achieving just over per monththe people who rallied around to support my public journey were incredible that next endeavor that you launch whether its creating handcrafted products for the farmers market starting a new coffee shop if you share your story and give people a way to follow your journey they will some will buy your products others will tell their friends and still more will cheer you on an audience is actually easier to build than we make it seem have a goal the goal could be to make your first sale at a farmers market write a book renovate an airbnb pay off your debt landing your first four design clients or just about anything else the point is for it to be clear who you are and what you are trying to accomplish document your progress this next step is a little hardernot because its difficult to document progress but because its difficult to do consistently choose a cadence and write updates reminding people of what you are trying to accomplish and sharing your progress learnings and challenges on that journey that could be through a monthly blog post or even just through more regular instagram posts ask for help finally understand that everyone wants to help so let them if you need advice on how to price your products or how to setup your business just ask if someone in your small audience doesnt know they most likely know someone who does throughout my journey ive been blown away by how many people step up with advice introductions and support whenever ive asked so as you plan your next big step to build wealth i encourage you to set a clear goal share it publicly and give your community the opportunity to rally behind you and make it happen it takes longer than you think but the results can be incredible a few years ago my friend james grandmother passed away in her s she had grown up in the small town of council in central idaho when she was years old her husband my friends grandfather passed away leaving her alone she was financially secure through two paid off houses one in boise the other in council but she still had a long life ahead of her she always loved cute little houses and decided to buy one to rent out as a new hobby to fill her time a couple years later she bought another and rented it out as well then another and another by the time i met her she was years old and in the years since she started she had acquired more than cute little homes throughout southwest idaho none were very expensive probably around each but combined they turned into quite the real estate empire each returning a great monthly cashflow that she rolled into buying the next property in addition to this she bought a one hundred acre ranch on the boise river outside of town what had started as a hobby to pass her time and distract from loneliness turned into a real estate empire worth over million the takeaway is not necessarily to buy more houses though that has been a great path to wealth for many but that consistently reinvesting time and money into wealth creation rather than lifestyle inflation can have incredible results if allowed to play out for long enough the unique shapes of increasing income i mentioned earlier that the further to the right on the income ladders you go the more difficult they become but also the greater the upside it may be hard to understand exactly why that is so lets explain it with three visuals stair step linear exponential stair step stair step diagram most people will experience a stair step approach to income in their life as they move from an hourly position to a salary that comes with a raise which would be a step up in income then each additional salary increase will be another step in some careers these may be small and often in others they may be spaced out over more time and be quite large residency to a full doctor or making partner at a law firm you can also supplement a salary with an additional project a rental property buying an ecommerce site a recurring consulting agreement that will result in another stair step in your income while this model isnt the best possible it is how nearly all wealthy people built their wealth you wont have unlimited upside but over years it is one of the most reliable paths to wealth linear linear diagram enough stair steps that are close together will simply look like a linear growth curve when you zoom out so while a raise every few years will look like a stair step a freelancer steadily able to increase her rate will look linear in the same way that adding a rental property once is a worthwhile stair step adding one per year is linear the most common linear growth that i see in my work is in selling digital products as traffic increases so do sales it isnt exponential because traffic is still the bottleneck but each new blog post or search engine ranking brings a few hundred more people to the site each month over time that drives more sales and income increases exponential exponential diagram exponential growth comes from when each sale of a product truly makes the next sale come more easily it requires a product that you can sell repeatedly whether physical or digital that can be created at a large scale meaning you cant be selling your time exponential growth often starts slowly taking months or years to reach any kind of meaningful revenue but fast forward a few years or a decade and the growth can be absolutely astounding software companies marketplaces and large ecommerce companies have an incredibly high ceiling and can grow insanely fast in their prime but that usually takes time significant skill and meaningful capital my own journey to building wealth the one thing i can guarantee is that your journey wont be linear mine own journey involved jumping all over the place let me show you woodworking years old the very first way i made moneyother than my parents paying me for work around the housewas making wood carvings on a scroll saw a family friend had given me and selling them around the neighborhood each one making between depending on the complexity while after that it would be a few years before i would revisit products i still find it interesting that i had such an early foray into products most important skill acquired the courage to knock on a strangers door and sell them something wendys years old i was in a hurry to grow up and wanted to start taking college classes i needed money in order to pay tuition so i picked up the phonebook and started calling businesses asking how old you had to be to work there most said wendys was the first to say theyd hire at working the drive through we would compete with other local stores to set the fastest drive through services times i worked the cash register and learned to type on it without looking in order to make sure i wasnt the bottleneck most important skill acquired how to work very fast freelance web design years old i learned web design in high school and started to make money designing websites and logos in i dropped out of college to do it full time my biggest success was building a web application for most important skill acquired how to find work with and charge clients lead designer in a startup years old in i was hired on full time by one of my clients a person venture backed startup i stayed for nearly three years growing to lead their product design team i spent my time designing in photoshop learning to code ios apps and working with a large team as the company eventually grew to over team members most important skill acquired an introduction to leading a team building and selling ios apps years old while working for the software startup i started building ios apps on the side then i went out on my own to freelance and continue to build my own apps as my first venture back into products since the days of selling handmade goods door to door i had to learn to write a sales page code apps market products and launch into the ios app ecosystem most important skill acquired building a product and selling into an existing marketplace selling my first book years old after building quite a few ios apps i turned to writing a blog and then eventually writing a book teaching how to design apps the book was quite successful selling nearly worth in the first week this launched my entire journey with building an audience and selfpublishing most important skill acquired how to build an audience building a software company years old my nextand finalventure was to focus on software again and build the email marketing company i wish i had when i started growing an audience today convertkit earns over million per year nearly seven years after starting convertkit it is what im still doing and plan to do for at least the next decade most important skill acquired how to work relentlessly on one idea for long enough to reach its full potential over the years ive done so many different things but each one was a step towards learning the skills required to earn a living and build wealth considering leveling up your income and wealth as youre considering making the jump to the next level ask yourself these questions what rung am i on in my journey to build wealth which ladder is this new idea on how far is it from the rung and ladder i am on currently what new skills would i need to close the gap between where i am now and where i want to go how long will it take to acquire those skills and get initial traction do i have the runway both in time and financial security to make that jump without putting my finances in danger these arent meant to discourage you from making a move instead the answers to these questions will give you awareness to make you more likely to succeed in the journey ahead lets close with one final example the patel motel cartel did you know that of motels in the united states are owned and operated by people of indian origin one of my favorite articles ive read in the last year was in the new york times and was actually written back in its titled a patel motel cartel in the s families from india started to immigrate to the united states because it was so expensive they often relied on money from family to help them get settled once in the united states they got jobs earned more and paid it forward to others in their family to help them make the same move the money was never repaid but always paid forward but the real magic came with what they did next instead of pursuing normal jobs a family would pull together all the money they could from their own savings and from extended family and use it as a down payment on a small motel the family would then move into it and run it full time spending their days and weekends working the front desk cleaning rooms and making beds over time as it grew into a meaningful business they would have some free capital to pay forward to another relative who would do the same thing they worked hard hosting thousands of guests and carefully stockpiling money whenever the stockpile grew large enough it didnt go into increasing their lifestyle but instead into the next opportunity which was nearly always another motel by when the article was written indian immigrants owned half of all the motels in the united states not only were they continue to earn great revenue from each booking but the land has appreciated over the decades to become incredibly valuable making these families rich my three favorite things are that they rallied together to make one family succeed and in doing so raised the tide for everyone never paid back the money but instead paid it forward to the next family member to create opportunity for them always poured the money into the next revenue generating asset another motel rather than inflating their lifestyle while he doesnt come from a culture where that kind of assistance and collaboration is common my friend patrick is well on his way to creating wealth through following the same model as he leverages his construction skills to build more airbnbs philip is doing the hard work to launch a saas companylearning all the skills necessary to jump ladders in a single move his company linkmink is now growing quickly and we even switched convertkit to their platform a few months ago and ive used the skills i learned from each ladder to build a company to nearly million in revenue no matter where you are in your journey whether you are searching for a job living paycheck to paycheck launching your first business growing an audience starting a side project scaling your company or looking for the next venture to invest in i hope this article helps to serve as a roadmap of whats possible building wealth is a skill a skill anyone can master given enough time and a relentless desire to learn and work hard
elckkv,Entrepreneur,2020-01-07 14:56:28,i scraped the top ecommerce stores using shopify here are my boring findings hey guys last month i realized anyone could pretty much find out who the biggest shopify stores are since theyre all hosted under the same ip knowing this i scraped the top shopify stores by alexa rank using myipsms so these are the most visited ecommerce stores using shopify in the whole world full list of the top shopify stores image ps i transformed the alexa rank into estimated monthly traffic for easier understanding now as for my findings clothing is king and the whole fashion niche rules over everything full breakdown of niches image of the top shopify stores had clothing as their main niche add accessories footwear underwear plus swimwear stores which amount to stores in total and you have exactly of the top stores belonging somewhere and somewhat in the fashion niche taking a closer look the biggest store currently on shopify is fashion nova which is a fashion company well duh with over million visits per month their traffic numbers are actually times as large as their nd competitor which is a makeup store now this really is the mountain vs oberyn levels of competition fashion nova can essentially ab test their landing pages and user experience until their conversion rates just blow away every competitor and even then this as a whole will benefit the entire fashion niche as they can simply steal learn from fashion nova ux choices and improve their own conversion rates for free no other niche has this much free information to be studied and replicated online main takeaway if you want to start a new ecommerce store or expand yours a local needleworker can end up being more helpful than mindlessly browsing aliexpress you dont need to have walmart prices to sell like walmart full breakdown of the bestsold product prices image yes some of the bestsold products on the list are under but of the top stores have their bestsold product at a price point above were you expecting this i really wasnt this means big stores arent obliged to do dropshipping prices even though some of these stores are clearly sourcing products for cheap in asia branding up and niching down seems to be the absolute key here and see it for yourself go to any store from the list and check if you cant identify their customer persona straight away all these stores have made the effort to lasertarget their niche because that means theyll be the only ones able to satisfy it finally having a larger margin per product is also one of the very few ways these stores get to increase their sales because larger product margins will mean a larger advertising budget which in the end will mean a larger number of customers reached remember that almost all of these stores survive and grow strictly through facebookinstagram ads of these stores are using facebook ads trust me i checked them onebyone main takeaway always focus on selling the benefit and not only product features so you can brand yourself and distance your product from the common youtube drop shipper mobile site speed isnt a concern when you get a lot of traffic mobile site speed breakdown image some of these stores are taking longer to load on mobile than usain bolt took to run meters on the olympics its this bad and because of this it would seem that site speed doesnt affect nearly as much the sales or traffic numbers as one would predict however this a misleading behavior that you shouldnt replicate yes these stores still have their traffic and large sales numbers for sure but amazon found in an early ecommerce study that for every ms meaning of a second of site delay they lost of sales source meaning many stores in this list could in theory almost double their sales numbers by just working to decrease their site speed to regular values and all this without ever having to increase their traffic numbers this is free money theyre leaving on the table every month main takeaway focus on having your ecommerce site speed low especially mobile site speed because unless you already have traffic in the hundreds of thousands andor an established brand your sales will tank or never even takeoff and thats it for today now you can check the full interactive database of my data here but its okay if you dont because ill keep posting more databased insights right here thanks
15284g4,Entrepreneur,2023-07-17 17:22:41,this guy does m with employees by hauling gravel for the govt edit wow overwhelmed by the feedback here thanks for all the kinds words everyone im actually in touch with dan he made a reddit account and is answering some of the comments down below might be able to get him in for an ama if thats ever interesting just let me know xb people on twitter seemed to like this story so i wanted to share it here too im modifying so it fits this medium but basically theres a guy name dan crowley who saw the movie war dogs and was inspired to become a government supply contractor technically he makes millions from dump trucks even though hes only ever driven one once over the last few years hes grown to six employees and million per year revenue fun fact thats more revenue per employee than apple haha great example of how there really are good opportunities out there in the world of sweaty startups he also runs two other companies one in trucking one in real estate which add another million per year to the top line i interviewed him a while back this is the full breakdown of the gravel business including numbers how he actually started where he sees open opportunities in the field etc if you want to see the stuff about how he runs strs its here one of my favorite parts comes from his advice to new founders below thought people here might like it most entrepreneurs and business owners actually like talking about their business and giving advice myself included so never be afraid to network and ask questions you dont need to work as hard as people like gary vee say you dont need to grind hoursday for your business to work yes it might take longer for it to be successful if you dont but that doesnt mean its going to fail one last thing dont be fooled into thinking this business is super easy dan will be the first to tell you its not but its also not super impossible its doable if you have the grit to try stuff and figure it out as you go hello who are you and what business did you start my name is daniel crowley and i guess i would describe myself as a serial entrepreneur im originally from massachusetts i went to college in new orleans and have stayed ever since i now live here with my fiancé and dog i have three main businesses crowley holdings government contracting crowley hauling own and operate six dump trucks crowley properties coown and operate shortterm rental properties i couldnt think of a good brand name so i just went with my last name crowley i spend the majority of my time with crowley holdings which i started in we do million in annual revenue its a government contracting business we supply sand and gravel as well as perform civil projects for the government i got the idea from the movie war dogs and thought man i can do that but i didnt want to supply arms and munitions so we started with sand and gravel eventually we won a contract and built the business up from there in we won the largest rock delivery contract in missouri state history roughly million to deliver tons of shot rock about dump truck loads we had or so dump trucks running all day every day for about six months to repair three levee breaches whats your backstory and how did you come up with these ideas for crowley holdings the idea started after listening to this podcast on npr probably when it aired back in it was the story of two somethings who ended up winning a ton of federal contracts the story eventually became the movie war dogs in one part of the story stuck out to me specifically one of the first contracts they won was supplying gallons of propane just by playing middle man and brokering the contract they famously went on to win tens and ultimately hundreds of millions of dollars in contracts they also did some illegal things that wound up getting them both in trouble with the law i wasnt drawn to the arms and munitions aspect or of course doing anything illegal but i remember thinking i could do what they are doing why cant i supply propane to the air force eventually i started poking around the samgov website which is where the government posts rfqs requests for quotes anything you can think of is on this website rfqs for rolls of toilet paper cardboard boxes slices of american cheese bazookas tanks graveleverything i submitted bids for a number of random items cardboard boxes leather jackets for the air force etc before zeroing in on gravel eventually we won our first contract since then weve grown to bring in roughly million a year in revenue with a team of six for crowley hauling a lot of what we do involves dump trucks so i had a good sense of how things worked founding the company felt like a natural way to diversify over time weve slowly built up to six dump trucks i suspect we will get to over the next year or so if youre smart about how you finance them trucks like these can be used to offset taxes on other income more on that below take us through the process of building the first version of your products for crowley holdings the initial goal was to get our first sale to start i randomly submitted bids for government rfqs i think i first submitted a contract for cardboard boxes and then a contract for leather jackets for the air force i basically called around to get prices for whatever product the rfq called for then marked it up and submitted it to the government eventually i zeroed in on aggregate i submitted a bid for a contract for roughly tons of limestone for an air force base in belle chasse la we didnt win that one but we started submitting more and more aggregate bids eventually we won our first one in thats when ihad my oh shit moment i realized i actually had to deliver tons of graded aggregate base for the us national park service in the carolina sandhills damn do i need to fly out there what if something goes wrong should i be on site to manage the deliveries these were just a few of the immediate thoughts that came to my mind the project went smoothly and a business was born since then weve slowly built up to employees our next venture is trying to break into heavy civil construction work we will do work for the us army corps of engineers to rebuild levees and other earthwork definitely moving up to the big leagues to start these will be million per project but ultimately i think we can get to million revenue per year for crowley haulings the idea formed after i spoke with someone who owned dump trucks he connected me with a sales rep and i eventually negotiated and bought my first truck in mid i paid roughly financed of the truck over a fiveyear payback period at a interest rate one huge benefit to buying dump trucks is that you can finance of the truck and also depreciate of the truck in the first year check with your tax person to see if this is still true some of these rules change over time as long as you have a good infrastructure and can keep the trucks busy and profitable you can just match each year with how well you are doing in your other businesses to offset income taxes this is a good case study on how depreciation for tax purposes helps spur job growth if you are looking at million in income then you can just buy one to five dump trucks that year and depreciate them there is definitely risk here of course but in theory it could work that way since launch what has worked to attract and retain customers business is good crowley holdings and crowley properties are both profitable and growing they more or less were always profitable from the jump crowley holdings will continue to grow organically currently we operate around the country and have found a niche in sand and gravel supply contracts in the future i imagine we will grow to have a real presence in new orleans and louisiana at large as a legitimate construction company we are able to shake things up a bit by bringing in tricks techniques and technology that arent common in the construction industry in five years i anticipate we can be a million revenue business crowley properties continues to grow and be profitable i am currently adding five to units per year we just started expanding into tampa fla we have two properties there with a third in the works im currently deciding if i should keep growing organically or whether i should go out and raise some cash and add units per year if anyone has advice here i would love to hear it crowley hauling is a solid business it will never be a hockey stick type of company but it is a good way to diversify i also could see pairing crowley hauling with crowley holdings ultimately i believe well be able to win big levee or construction projects in new orleans and run our dump trucks on the job this way we can double dip i can see us getting to dump trucks in the next year or two beyond these goals im not sure if i want to take it to the next level dump trucks its doable but we will see did you ever have an oh shit moment where you thought it wouldnt work honestly not with my three core businesses however i have launched products or businesses that did not work including playboy alarm clock app my first product that i successfully launched to the app store i spent around on it and made maybe on it down river design i took what i learned from the playboy alarm clock app and launched a web and app development company i built the alarm clock with a software development firm in india so i did the same thing for clients i made some money but i could never turn the corner of getting enough business to hire or grow zap drd i partnered with the indiabased company zaptech solutions giving it the name zap zaptech drd down river design i had the same problem this move helped but the business still never became super profitable leadbuddy this lead generation business sort of worked but never turned the cornerin addition to a few other ideas that never made it through starting your businesses have you learned anything particularly helpful or advantageous your business will never be perfect often you see people trying to make everything perfect before launching their business or product most businesses fail before they start because they never make it to market i dont have any stats to back this up but i would be willing to wager it is correct you need to get it out to market asap asap and you can always tweak it what platformtools do you use for your business trello what we use to organize thoughts and projects clickup similar to trello but with more automation features i might move the crowley holdings team from trello to clickup i have been pretty impressed with it slack a musthave tool to communicate with the team efficiently macs i was a longtime pc guy but apple finally won most of what i do is communicate with people being able to text and call from my computer helps out in a big way virtual champions i think ive finally found a good virtual assistant ive only used it for a short time but i am already getting a lot of tasks out of backlog what have been the most influential books podcasts or other resources the hour workweek i readlistened to this book a few months ago but i wish i had years ago it all aligns well with my thinking work smarter not harder become efficient with your time use the free time this creates however you choose my first million podcast you all know it the pitch podcast slightly under the radar its like the real shark tank meaning the pitches are much closer to what its like in the real world advice for other entrepreneurs who want to get started or are just starting out ill come back to my mottos screw it just do it let it rip you need to get out there and do it if the business fails well you can apply what you learned to the next business ask for advice it took me too long to do this business is not that complicated there are plenty of people out there who have done it before who have made those same mistakes also most entrepreneurs and business owners actually like talking about their business and giving advice myself included so never be afraid to network and ask questions you dont need to work as hard as people like gary vee say you dont need to grind hoursday for your business to work yes it might take longer for it to be successful if you dont but that doesnt mean its going to fail delegate you need to delegate to grow your business will never scale if you cant learn to do this

ooqyor,Entrepreneur,2021-07-21 14:26:30,does anyone else want to be an entrepreneur only because you find the idea of being an employee disgusting it bothers me to my core to be someones subordinate call me narcissistic or worse but its just how i feel im actually humble and nice towards others i definitely dont feel the need to use others or have power over others but i hate others having power over me my independence is so so important to me even with a good boss i hate the dynamic of being an underling a subordinate an employee i dont even really want to have other employees my ideal business would be just me doing my thing all alone hell sometimes i feel like what i really want isnt entrepreneurship but living in the woods somewhere although thats very uncomfortable and unfeasible for me personally so entrepreneurship is sort of the only path towards a comfy solitary independent life now if i only could find an idea that works for me but thats another matter entirely

bx8oj9,Entrepreneur,2019-06-05 22:11:45,ive read over business and self help books and these are the i learned the most from never split the difference chris voss the most important book on this list it outlines and reinforces the fact that business negotiation and any human interaction is inherently very emotional its centered around negotiation but this book has so many solid management and leadership principles mirroring tactical empathy starting with no and labeling are all phenomenal the emyth revisited michael gerber the first stop for any beginner this is a great book about the importance of creating a business that can thrive without you preaches a lot of my favorite business principles like working on the things that are important for the long term but not necessarily urgent or pressing can be a little satire elementary at times the hotel description and sarahs all about pies are poor examples for the more accomplished entrepreneurs but the principles are rock solid entreleadership dave ramsey this book just has non stop quality advice about how to build a business the right way dave doesnt preach about politics or religion he just tells it like it is and tells the stories of what worked for him phenomenal read ego is the enemy ryan holiday ryan studies and preaches stoicism and how to handle emotions rejection and stress managing that split second between an event and your reaction is what life is all about the ego is the enemy shows the incredible importance of remaining humble and the dangers of overconfidence and an inflated ego i also recommend the obstacle is the way and the daily stoic by the same author principles life work ray dalio an awesome book but my main takeaway is the discussion on strategic decision making radical openmindedness its human nature to want to be right and appear right in the eyes of others people who make the best decisions know they dont have all the answers so they are open to many other points of view they change their minds often even at the expense of their own ego built to sell john warrillow this book talks about how to get your life back once your business takes over how to specialize

1cneg40,Entrepreneur,2024-05-08 20:24:44,why is everyone a years old millionaire these days its becoming hard to get a grasp of what entrepreneurs are actually making i remember years ago when making k month online was considered a massive success gurus used to talk about how it took them decades to get to that level nowadays it seems like every youtuber is a years old agency owner making month google their name even on reddit plenty of people can attest that they are legit and the real deal am i missing something
18ckcw2,Entrepreneur,2023-12-07 01:48:40,who knows someone with a boring business that is killing it what do they do i always like these posts who knows someone with an unsexy business that is doing well and what does the business do
3lltwu,Entrepreneur,2015-09-19 21:40:42,how i literally started an amazon business in about month for about k brief introduction purpose of this post hey guys listen this is not a plug for anything this is me trying to help you in my opinion all the info you need to start an amazon business is on youtube reddit and podcasts in my humble opinion youd be a fool to pay thousands for a course or bootcamp when you could spend that on product i did it with k and in about a month below is how i did it step by step with very specific examples from my process before i dove into this world the phrase start a business was intimidating to me what how isnt that for stanford mbas folks with millions of dollars etc dont you need an earthshattering idea that will change the world no and no you need some common sense willingness to put in about hours in a month and a thousand bucks note if you have anything more than to devote to this it only makes it easier but i did this with less than what you need dollars about hours of time to work on this in a month an internet connection a mailing address the steps step amazon research approx time week approx cost go to amazon find a product that meets the following basic criteria it sells well the top results dont have too many reviews guys with reviews good guys with reviews bad too much competition guys with reviews very bad no demand no national brand dominates the product dont sell basketball shoes against nike and underarmour in general you want something small and light this is extremely important this is the most important part of the process and a long arduous process you will find products you love and in two days they will seem like crap its all part of the process here is a screenshot of the numbers for the top products for a certain keyword that i consider good and am considering pursuing right now imgur why is this a good product there are a lot of sales per month anything over k sales per month for the top few competitors on a keyword is great why because even if i capture a small percent of the market share i can make k per month in profit here not bad people with as few as reviews are doing kmonth in sales and reviews are the toughest part of this game i dont care if you invent the cure for cancer if it is on page of amazon with reviews no one is buying it i can get reviews in a week or two and if my product is good and the marketing is good i will be making a lot of money here step aliexpress buy your inventory approx time days approx cost this is where you go to aliexpress and you simply buy your product and it is delivered to you in about weeks thats it usually you want to go through alibaba better rates but you also have to buy large moqs minimum order quantities and wait for a long time for it to get to you right now we are focused on speed and aliexpress is like amazon you order of something and in weeks its at your doorstep period lets say i decided to compete in water bottles hint do not compete in things like water bottles and iphone cases firstly water bottles are dominated by great brands nalgene and camelbak secondly these are too popular and hundreds of buyers with deeper pockets than you are aggressively pursuing if its obvious it wont work and you will be buried on page of results making sale a month heres how you do it a search water bottle on amazon b check out the top sellers what traits they have etc pay special attention to the price for a water bottle looks like the top ones are going for so you will price yours at c search water bottle on aliexpress i did and on the first page i found this a cool looking foldable water bottle made from food grade material bpa free leakproof drop resistant looks swanky could probably sell bucks a piece d the price is bucks a piece you may be thinking sweet buy for sell for game on no no no my friend each piece also costs about to ship to you from china so thats per piece amazon then takes a cut for allowing you to list it thats probably another packaging is another per piece you need this you cant just sent customers a loose water bottle and shipping to to amazon will be about cents a piece so a product that costs will allinall actually cost about to get into amazon warehouses so youre making a profit per item in this example in general you want to shoot for much higher which is why i am not doing this and illustrates why you dont go into popular products companies with deep pockets are selling of these per month which makes it worth it to you selling items a month at profitis not worth it lets say i buy water bottles including shipping to me i am paying that is per unit see screenshot below imgur step while you wait for product to arrive get the marketing ready packaging approx time weeks approx bucks here is the easiest way i found to make professional looking packaging for cheap if you can think of a better idea do it but this works in a pinch go to a site like uline order boxes at cents a pop thats bucks next find someone in your area who does stickers design your own sticker in photoshop or gimp if you cant afford it and print these in general its per sticker so total stickers box and boom you have packaging dont over complicate it this is all you need it doesnt need to be applelike packaging and design just enough to get the job done here is a whited out picture of my packaging for my product imgur again not worldbeating but for a week or two of work it looks professional enough step while you wait for product to arrive get the marketing ready photography approx time days approx guys you need good product photos ask a friend who has a nice camera to get you some take some good photos with good lighting this can be done diy for minimal money and learn to white out backgrounds to your photos by yourself takes an hour or twovery valuable skill not gonna get too much into this but this is huge people click on your product based on photo it conveys that you are a professional company and not some putz in his basement even if you are at a minimum you want your listing to look like this search for skye bottle these dudes or dude or chick whatever sourced some items tossed up a quick page and their listening doesnt look amazing this isnt a company at all this one bottle is making k a month this is possible step the final shit approx time weeks approx you get your bottles by now you have your boxes and stickers put the stickers on the boxes put the bottles in the boxes pack them up put them into a bigger box sign up for an amazon professional seller account month first month is free create a listing put all info on your product and the pictures of your product up send in your units to amazon fba warehouses this will be about for this example in weeks amazon will receive your stuff sort it and distribute it to their warehouses and voila congrats you have now started your own brand and are selling on amazon misc notes give away of these in exchange for reviews pretend you didnt pick water bottles but something where you need reviews to get to page you need those asap you now have bottles left that is what you sell if they sell reinvest into more bottles and bam you have your own company and small business what if my product is a success lets say your product sells out quick contact the seller ask about wholesale pricing for an order of pieces or more if you get it for a pop from aliexpress wholesale pricing probably means you can get it at per piece if you order a lot rinse and repeat if your seller is a reseller and not the wholeseller go on alibaba find a manufacturer who can make the exact same product as your got send them a sample or the spects order a lot rinse anad repeat good luck edit disclaimer if you are ready to take this seriously use alibaba not aliexpress i recommend using aliexpress if you want to hack your way to do this and have a basic product up within a month if youre tired of studying and want to act already if you want to build a business with customers within days this is a decent way to go but its best to spend more than and the best way to do this is to source on alibaba alibaba is where you get shit in bulk you get lower prices and you deal directly with manufacturers so you can print your logo onto things customize packaging change the color etc you dont worry about putting stuff into boxes and labelingthey do that for you alibaba has minimum order quantities moqs and most factories will not deal with you if you are ordering less than a few grand of stuff if you are not ready to commit to that or want to dip your feet in use aliexpress if youre ready for the big leagues use alibaba the steps are pretty much the same

1jo3gvt,Entrepreneur,2025-03-31 13:41:52,my observations of wealthiersuccessful people as a hotel worker tldr i work in a star hotel and have noticed clear behavioral differences between wealthy and lowerclass guests wealthier people tend to be simple organized and efficientminimal luggage clean car interiors quick and hasslefree transactions and they almost never lose their valet tickets lowerclass guests often bring excessive unnecessary items have cluttered cars misplace their valet tickets constantly and make things more complicated for themselves its not just about moneyits a mindset difference wealthy people tend to move through life with less friction by focusing only on whats essential i work in a star hotel where rooms range from to usd per night depending on the tier season and demand even a basic room can go for over on new years eve because of that wide price range we get all types of guestseveryone from junkies and average joe workers to wealthy business owners highincome professionals and celebrities one thing ive noticed that often really separates the higherclass guests from the lowerclass onesbeyond just moneyis their simplicity and organization in how they handle themselves wealthier guests tend to arrive hand over their keys without hesitation and move on with zero fuss after the essential info is handed over they dont overcomplicate things their luggage is minimal wellpacked and often in a matching set thats easy to move around a lot of them just carry their own bags because its faster and more convenient but even when they need help their stuff is simple to handle their cars almost always clean and organized insideregardless of whether the exterior is spotless or covered in dust even one time we had a very wealthy family from malaysia visit possible politicalmonarchy connections they tipped like crazy and often people dont tip in my country they had rooms and a fair amount of luggage on departure they filled mercedes vans from the malaysian embassy with luggage with the seats folded down it was easy considering they were all congruent suitcases and easy to squeeze in beyond that theyre lowmaintenance and efficient in communication obviously there are exceptions but in general rich people dont waste time complaining about nonsense or trying to finesse freebies even when they do have a legitimate issue they bring it up in a way thats calm direct and solutionfocused instead of being dramatic or entitled they also tend to trust the process they dont hover around the valet questioning if their car will be safe they dont ask the front desk a million basic things they could google in two seconds they understand that hotels have systems in place and they just go with the flow meanwhile a lot of not all lower and middleclass guests operate on a completely different wavelength they often show up with way too much stuffexcessive carry bags heavy nonrolling luggage random loose items stuffed into shopping bags or tossed onto the backseat ive seen people bring massive powered eskies bags full of groceries and an entire wardrobe for a onenight stay one guy even had a whole trunk full of frozen food for a twonight stay they tend to bring things they think theyll need but in reality theyre just overpacking and making their own lives harder a smaller but very telling detail valet collection tickets in case youre unsure every peraon is given a valet ticket to collect their vehicle if they dont have it we need photo id and search it up which can be a lengthy process wealthy guests almost never lose them they keep them in their wallet a specific pocket or somewhere they can grab it instantly the second they return they hand it overno fumbling no searching lowerclass guests constantly losing them they shove them into random bags crumple them into their pockets or straightup forget where they put them half the time theyll show up at the valet stand emptyhanded then spend five minutes patting their clothes digging through their bags and swearing they just had it some even argue that they never got one in the first place like were supposed to magically remember their car out of the we park every day the biggest difference ive noticed wealthy and successful people operate like essentialists they only bring what they actually need their approach to travel is smooth efficient and stressfree a lot of them follow the same kind of thinking outlined in essentialism the disciplined pursuit of less by greg mckeownfocus only on what truly matters ignore the rest and heres the thing its not just about money ive seen middleclass people who carry themselves with this level of organization and simplicity and they stand out just as much as the rich likewise ive seen people with expensive cars and money to burn who still roll up with chaosoverpacking micromanaging losing things and just making everything more complicated than it needs to be at the end of the day wealth isnt just whats in your bank accountits how you move through life the difference in mindset is clear as day

s30vae,Entrepreneur,2022-01-13 14:36:02,i hired content writers from different websites and most of them were scammers ive been wanting to publish more content on my site so i decided to hire a writer to help it turns out that there are tons of places to hire writers online freelance marketplaces like upwork content mills like textbroker higherpriced content services and agencies and plenty of job boards for writers so i thought why not waste a bunch of money and turn this into a big experiment so i tested different websites for hiring writers and outsourcing content i spent an embarrassing amount of money and by the end of it id reviewed articles from hundreds of writers the results were a minefield of the articles were plagiarized or spun stolen but with slight tweaks to make it harder to catch were aiwritten nonsense and many writers included irrelevant links to lowquality sites probably in order to charge other clients for linkbuilding services surprisingly these issues came up at practically every pricing tier whether the fee was under word or over whether through a job board a freelance platform or a contentwriting service some sites even reinforced bad behavior for example i wouldnt recommend any site that offers article spinning as a service or any platform that lets writers hide unfavorable client reviews im looking at you verblio both verblio writers i tested sent me plagiarized articles luckily a few sites were much much better here were my favorites best writing service express writers expresswriterscom its more expensive than a content mill but a bargain for the quality got me a kword article at their authority content tier it was clear and concise wellstructured and wellresearched and backed up with good examples and links to relevant resources i gave it a out of for content quality best inexpensive and fast writers writeraccess writeraccesscom at per word for their most expensive tier i didnt expect writeraccess to be very good it isnt as good as express writers but it might have the best pricetoquality ratio of any option out there i gave it a out of for writing quality and it only took days to get a word article best budget content mill iwriter iwritercom iwriters pricing ranges from under to per word i spent for a kword blog post the writing wont blow your socks off but from my testing the quality coming out of iwriter beats every other budget content mill i only gave it at out of for writing quality but thats good enough for lowcompetition affiliate blogs or anyone who thinks quantity quality best writing jobs board problogger jobs probloggercomjobs i bet half the pro writers in the world have applied to jobs on problogger you can use it to find freelancers for oneoff or ongoing projects or to recruit fulltimers a job listing gets you dozens and dozens of applicants if not alternatively another great and free writing job board is the rhireawriter subreddit my listing there brought me applications within a week when using any job board i recommend setting up a google form for your application process instead of using their application management system because when youre dealing with that many applicants you need to be able to quickly glance through them best freelance platform upwork upworkcom the haters are wrong ive hired upwork freelancers over the years but with so many lowquality freelancers there it can be like finding a needle in a haystack the key is having the right hiring process otherwise youll waste a lot of time for this experiment i hired two different writers on upwork one interesting thing about upwork is that you dont always get what you pay for the first writer charged me word and i would give her writing quality a out of not good the second writer charged word and his writing was a out of pretty decent good enough for most blogs and great for the price note people per hour is a good alternative to upwork if you dont mind british english but i dont recommend their fiverrstyle individual services just stick to the freelance marketplace side if youre curious i also published lots more details about my experience with all sites in a blog post yesterday its just a blog post no email address required or anything that post includes a job post template the strengths of content services vs freelance sites vs writing job boards what to include in your google forms application form and why to use one and a hiring process that filters out plagiarizers and bad applicants so you dont have to waste as much money as i did plus more detailed reviews of all sites with writing excerpts of the work i received

6pgcas,Entrepreneur,2017-07-25 14:07:27,building an figure business in years lessons learned faqs bigass brain dump hi im matt bertulli and im an entrepreneur angel investor and now author i like building sustainable businesses and working with good people and while my entrepreneurial journey is far from over i thought the year mark was as good a time as any to share my story and hopefully some lessons that can help you on your journey ill link to a few things below so you can see that im a real boy but theres no hidden agenda in the links read i have no course to sell you what im building right now item in i started and still run demac media an figure business with close to full time employees item i am the cofounder of pela case a figure soon to be figure ecommerce brand item ive made a handful of angel investments over the years into various industries including ecommerce brands an alcohol brand qui tequila and a night club item ive also decided to do one of the scariest things ive ever donewrite my first book called anything anywhere its a weird thing putting your thoughts down in a permanent place especially something as permanent as an actual book but while i was spending all that time writing i started to reflect on how ive gotten to where i am today a friend of mine suggested that i write a post like this and i had run out of reasons not to also since i started putting myself out there speaking gigs medium essays etc ive been getting questions from all corners of the interwebs and i needed to centralize this stuff so i can point people to one location so why not reddit ps i will monitor this thread and answer any questions you might have so please ask away ive tried to structure this post into one part story one part lessons learned and one part common questions with my usual answers get asked these a lot this post is words and my team has told me its about a minute readto set your expectations the beginning i started my career as a selftaught software developer this was in the mids im now and to say things were different then would bewell obvious i am grateful for having learned to code in the s as it gives me great appreciation for how low the barriers have come to get into the craft like most i worked a bunch of different jobs from until before deciding to break out on my own entrepreneurial journey and start demac media finding the gap i had no business plan just a rough idea of what i wanted to do i was working at netsuite at the time and saw how much business we referred out to service partners and thought that id rather be the guy getting referrals than the guy giving them it was that simple i sort of knew that i wanted to focus on ecommerce since i grew up in a multigeneration retail family selling furniture and knew the space very well there was also a serious lack of competition in the canadian market in as ecommerce had yet to really gain steam with our larger retailersbrands thats one of the keys to our success we were early probably too early when i look back but none the less we dont take it for granted that timing was certainly on our side the accidental big business i also never intended on things getting to this point after netsuite i really just wanted something small that made me a decent living and i could call it my own i just wanted to have fun with work again so i made the leap and started demac media many of my first hires will laugh when they read this because i was famous for saying wed never have more than employeeswhoops as you can tell from the title of this post it has taken almost a decade to get to where we are i didnt do it alone far from it more on that below ive had so many helping hands in the form of mentors partners friends and customers to count i learned a great deal of patience over these years and if i could tell my year old self thing it would be this be patient and always assume you dont know shitcause you dont continuous learning im highly skeptical of most of what i read or hear when it comes to top x ways to build a million dollar business in months or less in my experience there are simply too many variables at play for someone to prescribe one way of doing things as the way to build a great business however i do find other entrepreneurs stories incredibly helpful i have done especially well with studying a wide variety of industries and stories from within those industries and then applying these lessons to my narrowfocused businesses ecommerce i can spend hours a day just reading in other words i go wide in my learning and narrow in my practice lets dig into my biggest lessons learned and ill sprinkle in more back story as we go lesson your network is your networth thank you jayson gaignard from mastermind talks i was fortunate enough to have a pretty decent network early on when we were starting demac i give a lot of credit to and received a lot of value from the early days of lean coffee toronto a group i was one of the founding members of with the guys from twg bnotions jet cooper and others wed meet weekly to talk about all things lean startups and how they applied to our businesses most of us had less than employees at the time but that peer to peer learning was foundational i was new to downtown toronto when i started demac so i invested a lot of time into getting involved with the local tech and startup community while exhausting i met a lot of great friends and even some mentors advisors through these years of networking marathons i went into all of this just wanting to find my people and didnt realize just how much value would come from these relationships over time another big network win for me was getting invited to mastermind talks mmt in napa this is a world class event because the people in attendance are world class they are some of the most kind and generous humans ive ever encountered and i can honestly say im a better entrepreneur and better all around person because of the decision to attend and diginparticipate through mmt i met an amazing entrepreneur that had a shared passion for mountain biking he was the one to convince me to join eo entrepreneur network in by inviting me to meet his forum members all guy with businesses over m in toronto while they were having their quarterly meeting joining this forum turned out to be another major win in equipping me with the tools i need to continue to build and grow businesses it was being at mmt that also gave me the kick in the ass i needed to write my book meeting so many others that had taken the plunge and were still standing was encouraging i was scared shitless of putting my name out there in the form of something more permanent ugh a book and while this path has had its own twists and turns i know it was the right one my only regret was not investing more aggressively in my network earlier especially during those early years of starting demac media tldr nobody does this shit alone we all need help and lots of it investing in your network is one of the best things you can do if you truly want to build a good business lesson build a good business first ignore people telling you to dream bigger in the early days of demac we experimented with a bunch of different niches and technologies before settling in on magento an ecommerce software platform and going allin on ecommerce one of the best moves we made was formally partnering up with magento and investing in the platform not only did we get to associate our relatively unknown brand with their very well known brand we also didnt have to worry about building software from scratch and could instead focus on servicing our customers by building on something already established i cant stress enough how important that singular focus on one platform was early on once we stopped screwing around trying to be everything to everyone the sales and marketing engine started to really work im now firmly in the differentiateordie camp services businesses especially agencies need to learn this and apply it if you stand for everything you stand for nothing targeting a niche definitely narrows your addressable market but the benefits far outweigh this downside doing this likely means you arent going to build a gigantic company but who the hell really wants that anyway most of us just want a great business that makes profits and affords us the life we desiredesign im a huge supporter of service based businesses most will tell you there are lots of reasons these businesses suck but dig a little deeper and the real reason people speak poorly of service businesses is because they dont scale thats not entirely true they most certainly dont scale the same way that softwareproduct companies do but to say something doesnt scale is too narrow a statement service businesses just scale linearly largely based on human effort hours you can still build a very good business within the constraints of service based business models so if this is appealing to you go for it ignore the peoplemediawhomever telling you that you have to build something that scales lesson something about yoda and becoming a master of something i also invested a lot of time early on into learning my industry im a little obsessive when it comes to needing to read everything it drives my wife nuts in our nonbusiness lives since i can go down the rabbit hole on things that sometimes dont matter much however in business this has served me well since im able to keep up with a rapidly changing retail landscape i was spending easily hours a day in addition to my job just reading and making sense of everything i could get my hands on side note identifying that i had a unique ability early on was really important in our hiring strategy i had received advice from some mentors that i should focus on what im uniquely qualified to do and hire people to do the rest massive productivity win for people trying to scale humanintensive businesses i continue to study retail when people ask me what i do i sometimes tell them im a student of retail since thats what i feel like most days while ive been building demac media for years ive spent my entire life in retail in some form or another it still feels like home to me and even if i werent running demac id probably keep building retail focused businesses as i get tremendous satisfaction out of helping merchants succeed going narrow and becoming a master of one thing early on can feel really restrictive i get that i still think this approach has much higher chances of success than trying to create lots of business or revenue streams or whatever other bullshit insert cheesy internet marketer here is selling lesson the right customers are always right the rest aremeh key points item listen to your great customers they provide you invaluable feedback item shitty customers are just that shitty lifes too short to work with assholes and assholes typically dont bring value to the table item our customers hire us for our expertise instead of asking our customers what they want us to do we recommend what should be done were the expert not the customer some of my earliest customers ended up being some of our best customers i think we got lucky here i even count a few as personal friends of mine and regularly see these people outside of business this is something im particularly grateful for i got to sit side by side with some amazing entrepreneurs that have grown retailecommerce companies from to mid figures and more i have experienced almost every aspect of a retail business from the warehouse to customer service and everything in between this has taken time but it is paying dividends now literally and figuratively committing to learning a lot about an industry without any immediate return is very very valuable for these customers ive given up huge amounts of my own time ensuring they get what they need from myself and my team to ensure they are successful when things are working we push when things arent working we push these types of customers are the ones you build great businesses with weve also had some duds as customers all the bitching and moaning about clients you typically hear from service business owners is true by on a case by case basis i feel like ive experienced it all but know that i probably havent everything from the high profile entrepreneur who changes his mind weekly based on what he reads or hears on a podcast to the high power ceo who wants a partner when really just wants a whipping boy to agree with him luckily these experiences are not the norm most customers weve had just want help with things they dont understand the very best customers know what they dont know and are experienced enough to trust others to fill in the gaps lesson premature action can destroy you as we grew the company from of us in my basement to we had to learn all sorts of things we never thought would matter one of the biggest lessons was around the incalculable value that a great culture adds to a business in years weve managed to have a less than employee attrition rateincluding people weve had to let go the other more difficult lesson that stands out was not being able to keep everyone happy all the time both customers and employees most mistakes that lead to people being unhappy have to do with doing the right things at the wrong time i outline a specific example in lesson below of the outbound sales machine failures but there have been countless other instances where we tried to do something before we were ready opening in new territories hiring people too soon luckily not too many looking at the wrong data at the wrong time creating too much process too early and on and on i feel wiser for it but this is the shit nobody teaches you that you just wind up having to figure out theres no step program for this stuff honestly when i think about it the mistakes weve made could easily fill a book im sure most other entrepreneurs that have been at this a long time would probably say the same thing not all mistakes are good so dont set out to fail the best mistakes i ever learned from were someone elses lesson creating multiple strong sales channels is how you build leverage which is a critical component in sustainable growth once we were out of the gate and saw we had a sustainable business i decided to focus on adding in additional sales channels that would help create a little more stability depending on one channel to bring in all your revenue is a little scary once that channel gets larger all eggs meet basket our partnership with magento was something i owned and invested a lot of time into every time we got a new partner manager at magento i would spend time getting to know them and building that relationship now we have a partner aka channel team that handles these relationships and all of the activities around managing a strong multichannel business this investment into a strong channel early on gave us the sales and revenue to invest into other channels that we acquired customers through years into the business we started to focus heavily on this new thing that people were calling inbound marketing shit we even bought the software hubspot to go along with the buzzword to date weve published more than articles and this is still a major pillar in our marketing engine as our demac blog gets upwards of k visitors mo most of that traffic is just coming to us to learn but it has helped us establish some thought leadership in our industry and that in turn helps us acquire and convert business were now using our partnerships and inbound channels as leverage to create an outbound sales team that goes after our dream list of customers we have had some failed attempts at creating an outbound team machine and now that im looking back we were simply too early in chasing these we believe were ready now but who knows maybe ill be doing another reddit post in a few years about how we failed here again god i hope not lesson compounded steady growth is sanity you can double your business by growing year for years my desired growth of per year seemed painfully slow at first but compounded over time it made for some pretty significant gains in years through one of the things i was repeatedly told by my parents and grandparents as they ran their stores was that cash flow was king this translated into a bunch of different thought tracks for me but mostly it meant that if i wanted to grow my company id have to do so very tactically which meant calculated growth that wasnt too slow and wasnt too fast so that we best used our cash and didnt run out we managed to mostly pull this off with only years in where we went too far in one direction or the other for a variety of reasons we targeted somewhere in the yoy growth range and usually fell into it having grown up in a small family business our family sold furniture retail i was no stranger to the ups and downs of this life i knew there would be tough times i knew it would take its toll on my family still does however even knowing this and going into it eyes wide open there were still times where i got the wind knocked out of me shit i still have days and sometimes weeks where i ask myself what the fuck im doing with my life thankfully i mostly enjoy what i do for a whole variety of reasons and when i spend time thinking about the alternatives i quickly regain focus lesson adopt an operating system about years ago we started to adopt traction eos look it up and it has been a game changer in helping us achieve operational scale to match our sales and revenue scale this is another thing i would stress to my younger self sheer forceofwill is what got the company to m having an operating system that everyone in the business is using is what is taking us further around the same time years ago we also started to invest in what buzzword business folks like to call senior leadership there were a number of reasons for this but mostly it had to do with me needing to focus on wearing hat instead of i couldnt effectively leadsteer the ship if i was stuck in the weeds and i needed help if i was going to get out we formalized an exec team at this point and they are the fine folks who run the company day to day now while i focus on where the group of companies is going implementing eostraction with the team in place was painful but ultimately i think it will be one of our best moves yet having our entire company learn this new operating system together is allowing us to all to support one another even though it sometimes feels a little pointless part of eostraction is having what is called a visiontraction organizer vto the basic idea is that it is a one page document that helps clarify your year vision for your business it is a great tool to help you achieve alignment in your teams ours has us continuing to grow demac while also building out some additional products and business lines as long as we can we will continue to help commerce evolve thats our purpose i suspect that the companies are going to go through a lot of changes in the coming years as the retail landscape is just full of change right now and theres no way we position ourselves perfectly all the time lesson never stop laying foundation its the hard work the uncomfortable work but the right kind of work along the way i learned that i love thoroughbred businesses a term that ive lovingly adopted from my friend andrew wilkinson over at meta there are too many reasons to list in this post as to why i think everyone needs to bootstrap and build businesses so all id recommend you do is read material from signalsbasecamp as a good starting point demac media and pela case are bootstrapped self funded we are focused on being good businesses not big businesses as ive gotten older and especially as ive become a father daughter shes i care a lot less about how sexy something is in business and care far more about doing things that support a lifestyle that ive yet to figure out entirely not sure i will relationships are the key to almost all definitions of success and im still trying to figure out what that means as my wife and i figure out how we want to livehence the lifestyle comment in late i struck a deal with a fellow named jeremy lang to acquire of pela case which at the time was an idea he had been perfecting to make compostable iphone cases i didnt so much care about building a phone case company as i did about creating a better kind of product company one that left little to no footprint this decision was not just good business but also satisfied a personal need to start helping commerce evolve to a better place and to me that meant commerceretail needed to get a lot less wasteful i wont go into it too much but you can only help sell so much garbage most product people buy is landfill bound before it starts to weigh on you im determined to help change this global retail machine into something that we can be proud of leaving to future generations in the middle of we created a program at demac media we called merchant in residence the program was modelled after the entrepreneur in residence found at my venture capitalists with the basic idea being that wed hire a young entrepreneur to be and give them a brand to build with the backing of demac medias resources enter sunta our first mir and the driving force behind pela case growing into a figure business within months and is well on its way to being a figure business by the end of frequently asked questions q how are you growing pela i get some version of this question a lot especially since demac has worked with hundreds of merchants in various stages of growthscale everyone wants to know what the secret to building an ecommerce business is and mostly that means they want the silver bullet or tactic that gets them tons of qualified moneyinhand traffic truth is there is no easy answer here and it makes me a little sick trying to think about writing down every little thing i know about this subject here are some of my favourite responses points that i share whenever i get asked focus on one major channel and master it theres only so many online channels that have meaningful scale and the tools to let you test lots of shit to see what works the big google facebook instagram pinterest are where of us need to start and i like to pick one to go all in on before trying to master others for pela weve been heavy into facebookinsta same ad tool from day and are only now moving on to google do things manually before trying to automate you wont know what to automate until youve done the grunt work for example do manual influencer outreach before you go and get a servicesystem to do it for you your roi will be an order of magnitude higher largely ignore all the how to build a figure ecommerce business people out there most are just telling you to find a product on alibaba knock it off whiteprivate label it and sell it on amazon this is hardly the path to what i would call a good business its not sustainable and it certainly isnt teaching you shit about what its like to really build a brandbusiness dont buy every fucking app for your shopify store you dont need them all at the start and you likely wont need most of them for a very long time get the essentials first and by essentials i mean whatever you require to support that first major channel you are going to focus on start adding in additional apps like referral programs loyalty complex email flows and other stuff only once you have a foundation ecommerce costs money why because inventory when you enter the world of physical stuff theres a natural overhead that comes with it and its very different from its digital cousins this is a very hard industry to get into without some seed capital pela has taken k of investment in straight cash not time to get the business growing per month theres only two ways to scale an ecommerce company slowly and profitably or fast and unprofitably dont believe me do a google search for failed ecommerce startups and tell me how many you find that achieved massive scale and are still around today andor are in good shape if you trust me save yourself the google search and let me tell you its a very short list youre far more likely to succeed in ecommerce if you aim to build a small very profitable business slowly than trying to scale quickly this is amazons world and we know it we are starting to use amazon as a channel to help us get volume leverage but thats about all we use amazon for our intent is to build pela into a great global brand and the way to do that isnt by allowing amazon to keep all those customer relationships behind their walls we are only now q looking to add amazon marketplace on as a channel for pela and we wont even be putting all of our products on it as we want to create awareness and leverage back to pelacasecom main site q whats the most difficult thing about running a company this size or multiple companies for that matter balance growing businesses require a lot of nurturing the people the customers the processes everything really i believe balance is bullshit but its the only term that everyone seems to understand when i answer this question my goal is to operate in a state of flow i can tell when im out of it as everything i do feels harder professionally spiritually emotionally all of it the ups and downs of building a business has got to be one of the most consistent methods of knocking you out of flow managing large teams is really difficult next question will dig in to this the best businesses ive seen have very simple operating models the main challenge with demac media is that being a service business with more than service offering is that it is complex and therefor requires more management overhead to scale the relationship between scale complexity is something i think about a lot adding in multiple companies just makes my work more complex but i try and keep the individual businesses fairly isolated so they dont create complexity for each other this is also hard when under the same physical roof q do you like having so many employees most of the time yes sometimes no thats the honest answer ive never met an entrepreneur who loves having a lot of employees all of the time there are days where i really enjoy seeing so many people helping me on this journey then there are days where i think that the best business is the one without customers or employees not rational but honest i often have to remind myself that people are messy relationships of any kind are messy to expect the people side of any part of your life to be sunshine and roses at all times seems a little foolish business is no different one of the biggest challenges in scaling teams is communication it is very easy for things to get lost in translation with lots of people in a company as i mentioned above its hard keeping everyone happy all the time as the leader this is really hard on me emotionally i dont like it when anyone is unhappy as a result of a decision ive had to make sometimes i wish i was a bit more thick skinned but after almost a decade of doing this i dont think ill ever be ok making decisions that will result in someone not getting what they wantneed trade offs suck especially with people q whats my definition of success first this is totally subjective regardless of your definition success and failure sit on a spectrum so its good to recognize this and not get too obsessive with an absolute definition of one or the other to me success has more to do with freedom of choice combined with some positive impact i want the freedom to choose how i spend my time and i get joy from having impact that said im really careful and somewhat protective of my time now its the only thing im confident in not being able to make more of this is probably the one thing id tell my year old self to think more about if i could having the freedom to choose how you spend your time should also mean taking the time to figure out what charges you up and gives you purpose q whats your exit strategy hate this one ive lost count of how many times ive been asked this question over the years i never set out to sell demac and dont have any immediate plans to do so ive always said that for me to sell it would need to be a lifechanging deal i know that selling a company successfully is a very rare thing so i focus on building a good business first and believe that if i do that there will be opportunities to exit along the way i also think that there are many forms of an exit they dont all mean selling or ipo there are very large companies where the founders are no longer operational but rather shareholders and stewards of the business i dont have an opinion on which type of exit is better because i havent put a lot of thought into it my last comment on this a few years ago i was listening to a podcast forget which where some entrepreneur was talking about how every business hes started he knew the exit strategy from day it always struck me as kind of odd that youd build a business to leave it as quickly as possiblethat didnt feel right

p4aw1e,Entrepreneur,2021-08-14 16:13:06,a year ago i started a candle business as a side hustle with and i made k in total sales its not much but its growing slowly and surely a year ago i launched my candle business with and i made k in total sales this is my first post as a business owner i always dreamed of makingselling something anything i finally did a year ago and i thought it would be helpfulempowering to anyone who wants to start a business why candles there is a big market for candles and the product is validated the process of making them is easy to learn and you dont need a special expertise to come up with great scents many free resources are available to help with that you also dont need a lot of capital to get started and its an easy business to run from home my goal was to find the most convenient cost effective product and to build a brand around it this way i wont find excuses for myself and spend months ruminating about the perfect product how did i brand my candles a candle with a story and a purpose is more appealing than just a scented candle on the supermarket shelf i branded my candles around my personal hobbies i thought of my daily activities and how a candle could fit in there the first idea i came up with was candles to light when watching a movie the scents will be based on classics such as the godfather pulp fiction etc but then i realized that i should come up with a broader use case for my candles thats how the idea to base the candles on movie genres was born i kept brainstorming about my hobbies and i came up with candles for each hobby i had gaming candles bookish candles and as i was learning web development at the time coding candles now i had to choose one of them to brand my business around it was a tough choice and i wasnt sure which one would be more attractive from there i thought why not create a brand around the combination of those hobbies as a result i came up with the name geekycandles candles to empower the nerd in all of us now i had to decide how many candles should be in each collection pick a name and a combination of scents for each one to test starting with now that i have a clear idea of my product its time to actually test the scents i brainstormed for each candle i went to a candle shop bought fragrance oils for different fragrance samples and pounds of soy wax for pound wicks were cheaper on amazon for units then to the dollar store to buy glass shots boxes of for at this point i have all i need to start making my candles and testing the combination of scents i brainstormed for each candle the shot glasses are used as containers after pouring the wax and fragrance oil in the glass i would give the candle days to cure then light it in the bathroom a small space close the door give it a good minutes for the fragrance to spread then enter the bathroom to smell the candle this is how the testing was done now my product is ready click here to see a picture of my testing candles creating the website i cant recommend shopify enough they offer months free of charge and it makes the whole task easy so many great tutorials are available on youtube to help you understand the whole process i took a day or two to look at other ecommerce websites especially candle websites to get some inspiration i wanted a clean straightforward website and i found the right template on shopify it took me a week to build the website add each product and its description candles pictures were made on photoshop so was the label i am no expert but tutorial videos and forums did the trick i can give more details on this part if you are interested selling the product before i dive in i wanted to make clear that at this point i absolutely had no supplies i didnt want to spend money on a product that is not validated yet my idea was to make a list of my suppliers and their shipping delays jars and shipping supplies would arrive a day after ordering fragrances wax and wicks can be bought from the store on the same day i cant stress enough the importance of trying to find suppliers that are in the same city shipping can be unpredictable alright my website is ready i am ready lets try and sell those babies as a reminder i moved to canada a couple of months before i didnt have a social circle to help me spread the word so i started with creating my social pages ig twitter and facebook nothing came out of it but i was happy with getting a few followers then i created a coupon code and shared it in reddit facebook market and some facebook groups thats how i got my first sales in one day i was over the top at this point i was clicks away from ordering the supplies to make my candles the day after my first orders i had all my supplies and made the candles i shipped them two days later taking the time to pack them and sort out the shipping process growing the business in my experience the most challenging part of starting my ecommerce business is to drive relevant traffic to my website i started to post picture of my candles on relevant subreddits and recurrently no as recurrent as i should posting on my social media i also made sure to start a newsletter offering a coupon to anyone who would subscribe today i have around subscribers and i make sure to not spam their inboxes emailing them only when there is a promotion or a new product i am still struggling with emailing my subscribers its unclear to me how frequent should i email them and what content would they be interested in i also went through the influencer path dmd couple of instagramers and asked if theyd be interested on sharing my product in their page i received many positive answers but didnt get enough sales one sale from a bookish instagramer with k to whom i sent three candles the sale covered the expense of the product and its shipping atm i stopped focusing on influencers i might reconsider this path in the near future i also emailed bunch of retailers who might be a great fit to resell my product and in one year i was able to sell to retailers i am not doing enough in this department i could have contacted more retailers and got more wholesale orders i am planning on doing that more specially that i received a great feedback from my retailers i created an etsy store halfway through the year it barely had a cost and you can take advantage of etsys algorithm to gain some exposure i made k in etsy alone for a very low cost you only need to pay to list one product for months so yeah totally worth it luck here are some beautiful events that just happened i have to admit that being a local business and offering a sustainable clean ecofriendly product helped a lot my local hospital got in touch with me to buy my candles for their nurses they simply googled local businesses and found out about me i sold them candles my domain provider featured my business in one of their newsletter and it got me a huge amount of traffic with a great conversion rate my local library foundation found out about my business through a google search they purchased bookish candles a journalist included my website in an article written in yahoo as a sustainable environment friendly business mistakes firstly i am not consistent on social media and its because i am intimidated by taking instagramable pictures of my candles i am working on that and searching budget friendly setups for taking good pictures secondly i turned my back on paid ads and thats because ive invested around in google facebook and ig ads i didnt get any sales from those ads and gave up on them i am well aware that paid ads take time and money to figure out i just felt like i can market my products using free channels as a starting point and once i generate some profit reinvest a chunk of it on paid ads thirdly i dont have clear strategy to communicate with my subscribers i email them when there is a promotion running or a new product i feel like i can build a stronger closer relationship with them but i still didnt figure out how to do that i should probably take some time and do some research in this area lastly i dont reach out to retailers as i should have ive had a great response rate from previous emails sent to potential resellers but for some reason mainly procrastination i didnt stick to a specific number of retailer to email on a weekly basis i wish i had more online presence and report more often on my progress successes failures lessons and mistakes it might be helpful for anyone whos trying to build a business and also it will make me accountable to my audience and thus stop procrastinating if you have any questions about my journey or want to chat please reach out i will be more than happy to share and help also any critic or feedback is welcomed i am learning and always will links click here for screen shots of my total sales i am adding a link to my website to have an idea about my products and how i built every collection wwwgeekycandlesca here is also a link to my ig page to see how i am working on improving pictures of the products and how i suck at publishing more often wwwgeekycandlescageekycandles also

7jk4r1,Entrepreneur,2017-12-13 15:54:16,you do not need a unique idea to launch a business in fact youll probably fail if you do pink ocean strategy everyone thinks that in order to become an entrepreneur you need to have a totally unique idea also known as a blue ocean idea i think thats totally false and in fact the worst advice you can follow i originally wrote the the below for forbes but i thought it would be helpful to share it here hope its helpful happy to answer any questions this may not be what you want to hear but unless youre elon musk its incredibly hard to bring a totally innovative product to market the irony is i learned this lesson after winning a best new product of the year award for a completely innovative product a few years ago you may have heard of the idea of a blue ocean versus a red ocean when it comes to product development theyre pretty simple concepts a red ocean is the idea that there is a ton of competition in the area youre trying to compete in whereas a blue ocean is the concept that youre in an area where youve got the whole ocean to yourself a lot of companies think they should try and shy away from red oceans and stick to blue waters the problem is that if you are in a blue ocean with a totally unique idea it can be incredibly hard to make people aware of what your product does and that people actually need it ill give you a very specific example with our biggest product halo oral antiseptic when we launched in we brought an incredible innovation in germ control to market we got patents issued were showered with praise by the industry and were convinced and so was every single retailer in america that we would be an overnight hundred million dollar plus brand well what we found out was that it is incredibly expensive to explain exactly what halo is and why people should use it we literally spent millions on television print ads and coupons as well as an enormous public relations campaign it was brutal now we did eventually make people aware of the brand but it was an expensive path to go down i learned that innovation is just not enough for the average company or entrepreneur to make a product a winner you have to be able to get people to not only know about the product but believe in it and buy it thats tougher and more expensive to do than you think the best new products award we won as voted on by of americas top retailers thats why i now solely implement what i call pink ocean strategy put simply i go into product categories that are proven but i bring a unique angle to the market so youre probably asking ok afif so what makes for a product in a pink ocean a pink ocean strategy involves going into a proven product category with a product that uses unique features benefits or packaging to stand out so lets look at a couple examples of companies having great success taking a pink ocean approach the first is one that i assume youve heard of many times a little product by the name of the dyson vacuum the story of how james dyson came up with the cyclone mechanical action of his famous and very expensive vacuum is the stuff of entrepreneurial lore he spent years making thousands of different prototypes before he got it just right but guess what when he introduced his product he didnt have to prove to anyone that they needed a vacuum they already knew about vacuums he just created a more powerful vacuum with a unique cyclone action and became a billionaire in the process now that is pink ocean thinking now lets go from one of the highest profile brands to a general product category thats about as boring as it gets im talking about lip balms arguably one of the most commoditized product categories in all of retail i think we can all agree the world doesnt need another lip balm or does it because there are probably a dozen enormous lip balm brands that all have some unique angle eos comes in unique egg shaped containers that are vibrantly colored burts bees goes with the folksy au naturale vibe ironically now owned by clorox and lip smackers come in a thousand flavors you get the picture each of these lip balm brands has been able to take an utterly generic product and simply add a unique spin creating enormously successful brands in the process ironically even the great elon musk did not invent the electric car or obviously the car he took the lame idea of a fuddyduddy electric car that had been floating around for years and came out with a beautiful sports car creating a company worth tens of billions and turning the car industry upside down in the process so the grand take away forget about red and blue oceans and sail towards pink oceans by looking for products that are proven sellers and find a unique angle for your product

mhvryf,Entrepreneur,2021-04-01 13:53:05,turning a small app into a mo business hi all im a fullstack web developer from poland and together with my twin brother we built freeyourmusic freeyourmusic allows you transfer your playlists across music streaming services eg spotify apple music amazon music etc most of our customers are simply people who want to switch to a different provider and take their playlists with them i wanted to share with you how a small script i wrote for myself turned into a profitable business the company is approaching years how i came up with the idea immediately after the release of apple music in i really wanted to switch from spotify so i could try it out usually someone develops a tool like freeyourmusic but after waiting weeks i noticed that there still wasnt anything there moving songs manually wouldve taken me hours so i tried to figure out how to automate the process after a few hours of playing with apple script i created an app that literally just used the mouse to click things in itunes search for a song click more click to add music repeat how the app works its really simple first you log in with your account to one streaming service for example apple music and then you log into another lets say spotify freeyourmusic will then fetch all your playlists with song titles author names and albums from apple music then it will perform a search in spotify with a little bit of magic to properly match songs eg some services use feat and others feat once fym has properly identified all the songs it will create a playlist in spotify adding multiple sources and destinations is always a bit tricky as they are so different from each other lets turn it into a business i figured what i built could be useful for others so i made a small website and posted it on producthunt at the beginning it was free but people could donate money via a buy me a beer button the first day i got reviewed in multiple newspapers and online magazines got k unique visitors to the website and made in donations i thought all of this because i made a small script after work nice then my brother said hey lets make it better and start selling it so my brother mike our friend chris and i got together and spent all night creating a proper app i think it was am when we released it we got our first payment within minutes and then went to sleep for a few hours things got crazy after that i went back to work and saw people buying licenses all day long we had so much stuff to do that i had to take a week off work for the first few months we had to work hoursday half for our fulltime jobs and the other half for freeyourmusic how the revenue changed over time the first month we made over in revenue because of producthunt but the next few months were much smaller around now after over five years our average monthly revenue is around levels weve experimented with different pricing models it was at beginning then and after some tests we saw that a price mark for freeyourmusic works the best in the meantime weve also added support for ios android and many new music services thanks to freeyourmusic my brother and i were able to quit our day jobs and focus on building our own companies how we grew from the beginning we focused on having the correct seo tags and all the basics if you google seo website checker you will get ton of resources telling you what you are missing meta tags descriptions fast loading h tags compressing etc it all affects your google ranking after that it all grew organically we were just constantly improving our apps and adding new services and platforms we were also the first to support apple music playlist transfer via an ios app which was made possible with the ios update the real growth started when we realized that freeyourmusic was a real business not just a cash machine that would last for few months after that we started paying ourselves fixed salaries but not too much we kept lots of money in the companys bank account and that allowed us to invest in the business weve hired more people to help us with the development marketing and customer support were constantly thinking about how we can improve freeyourmusic so that users are happier right now we are launching a new service for music curators it will help artists and brands to grow their audience with universal crossplatform playlists how we handled legal stuff freeyourmusic was an overnight success and we started making money on day which forced us to open a company as soon as possible fortunately my parents had been selfemployed so i was accustomed to business in poland you can open your own company in less than a day so i took few days off work and by the next day had opened the company then we incorporated civil law partnership which was basically a joint venture of all the founders selfowned companies we had one problem with it though it was not a separate legal entity and all liability would fall on us in case of any problems people also trusted us less when they saw the weird partnership in the company name they are used to ltds and delaware companies so in the following months we established freeyourmusic ltd in the uk and moved everything there as for legal problems we were always careful to not step on anyones toes the music business is really strict about their rights so we made sure not to break any licenses things we would do differently for sure we would have immediately started by using electron to build a windowsmacos version based on one codebase at the beginning wed been building separate native windows app and native macos app then at some point we realized that it takes us too much time to copy features over to windows we had been focusing on macos im glad we had balls to say lets rewrite what we have in electron so we will have one shared codebase except in a few cases like itunes proxy we would have incorporated as an ltd at the beginning we would have paid for proper logo and website design much earlier we would have used stripe instead of braintree because braintrees bank closed our account as a result of them not understanding spotifys sdk license of course we know all of this now but when freeyourmusic was starting we had no idea how long it would last so we were cautious to spend money we didnt quit our jobs immediately just in case fym failed and i think it was a good call you should not jump into deep water you should first try it out slowly and run your business as side project at the same time you should see where its going and make a decision quickly my current job or my business in hindsight we shouldve quit earlier some advice on how to turn your sideproject into a profitable business to be independent you have to make money to support yourself if you have a project youre working on after work but months have passed without it having any paying customers that usually tells you that theres no market for it or that you havent focused on it enough before freeyourmusic i created numerous projects that failed and this is what i learned all businesses have to make money and you need to quickly kill the ones that do not treat your side project as any other business if it doesnt make money after a few months either change something in your product or kill it and start something new also outsource things that take a lot of your time but could be done by anyone we wasted a lot of time replying to customer emails instead of improving the app read everything from paul graham his writings contain so much knowledge and good advice that youll be amazed go through stories of how other companies started its true when they say that almost every company has similar problems for sure there is some company from the same vertical or with problems similar to yours which you can learn from talk to others there are numerous slack groups facebook groups quora questions etc you will be amazed how much others want to help you diversify if we had kept focus limited to spotify and apple music and only on macos we would be much smaller or dead look around for market opportunities you are still not taking but that are easy to grasp with your product for example look at what uber has done with delivering food you can do the same even when you are quite a bit smaller than uber
iwmzv1,Entrepreneur,2020-09-20 21:46:37,i made selling a pdf and a video on the internet i have two info products on the market the good parts of aws a page pdf released on dec with preorders since oct everyone can build a twitter audience a minute video released on apr with no preorders these two products made in sales so far and in profit for an average profit of month the aws product took about hours to produce while the twitter product only took hours but in this business creating the content is generally the easy part finding customers is the bigger challenge ive seen many creators succeed with various approaches but im only familiar with one and it goes like this you find something you know really well and you give everything you know about it for free you do it on social networks forums and wherever people interested in your topic hang around if you manage to get some attention you will inevitably start getting questions and these questions become your market research you start answering the best way you can and whatever doesnt fit in a short response becomes an opportunity for an info product then if you choose to do the product youll have an audience to promote it to an audience who already told you it wants to learn more about the topic and that it wants to learn from you specifically but how big should your audience be for this to be viable i dont know unfortunately the fate of your products will depend on many things but if you have an audience thats asking you questions id say the odds are in your favor so lets dig into what happened since i put my first info product on the market first lets take a look at my audience size chart audience i had a bit over twitter followers when my first product went on the market directly or indirectly every dollar i made in this business can be attributed to this initial audience i could have created the same two products before i had an audience and im almost certain i wouldnt have sold any the initial success brought with it all the future success through testimonials and word of mouth so lets take a look at how the business grew since that launch chart income all products there seems to be a correlation between my audience size and revenue but this relationship is more complex than it seems new followers seem to bring new sales but new sales also seem to bring new followers i dont try to read too much into this relationship but i can confidently say that having attention is good for this business and its not the follower count that matters most its how many people know about you and want your perspective this is not easy to measure but youll know when it happens you keep getting lots of questions so lets jump into the performance of each product to see if we can learn something useful about how they were marketed first the aws product chart income the good parts of aws we can see how there was an initial boost from the launch that lasted for about a month and then sales stabilized at a steady rate then there was another boost midmarch partly because of a reduction in price and partly from a new ad campaign more on these later that momentum has slowed down since but its still chugging along at a reasonable rate now lets look at the twitter product chart income everyone can build a twitter audience this launch was very similar to the other product about k in two weeks despite having an audience twice as large k vs k followers however the twitter product took off much better after the third week and it settled at a much stronger steady rate heres how both products compare on top of each other chart profit days on market i had expected the twitter product to have a bigger initial spike considering my larger audience at launch instead the launch was almost identical but its momentum has been significantly stronger compared to my first product i have some thoughts about what contributed to this dynamic first the twitter product was sold at almost twice the price of the aws product second in hindsight i think i set the launch price a bit too high for the twitter product which likely dampened the launch spike in fact after weeks i reduced the base price by and that appears to have untapped a large pool of demand that was likely reluctant to purchase at the original price take a look at how the average sale price changed over time below and how it affected the sales volume above chart avg sale price days on market for now ignore those two big drops well analyze that experiment later on this chart shows my attempts at tweaking prices over time to try to find new demand with the aws product i started low and went high then went low again with the twitter product i started high and kept going lower my general takeaway from all this experimentation is that optimal pricing for consumer products is almost all about psychology and what seems rational might not be very effective let me explain in theory the best way to maximize profits from a digital product is to start with a high price and lower it over time this is very common with movies disney just released mulan last week for after a few months it will likely be on amazon video for then a few months later youll be able to rent it for and then a year or two later youll likely find it for free on netflix i tried to follow a similar approach with my second product but i misjudged the psychological aspect basically its tough to get from your most loyal fans and then go promote the same product at a few weeks later if i were to start all over again i would price the twitter product between and and i suspect it would have done much better in that range but even with this knowledge now im reluctant to drop the price drastically because id have to promote the price change to the same audience that includes thousands of my most supportive customers who paid the original price and i think that could be a shortterm gain longterm loss ps steve jobs faced this exact problem when he dropped the price of the original iphone after just months with my first product i went the other direction i took preorders at then launched it at and then increased it to after a month however the price appeared to meet some resistance and the product lost some momentum then the covid pandemic hit in midmarch and i took that as an opportunity and an excuse to reduce the price to this resulted in a significant second boost which helped generate momentum from new word of mouth that has carried on until now i have no specific advice on pricing and i only have experience with consumer products info products sold to businesses can likely command different prices however after days in this business my inclination is to err on a lower price at launch and make it up in volume selling more units at a lower price has highly beneficial sideeffects including being easier to do better reviews better customer satisfaction fewer refunds and most importantly the multiplicative effects of increased worth of mouth in this business selling products for each is a lot better than selling one product for because in the first case youll potentially get people promoting your product for free the chart below shows what i think is the opportunity i missed with my twitter product chart units sold days on market note how the aws product sold significantly more units throughout its lifetime excluding the recent spike despite my audience being about half the size also based on the engagement i get im convinced that my audience is more interested in twitter than aws my conclusion is that the twitter product could have sold significantly more units than my first product if i priced it lower and it would have likely made more profit through larger volumes and increased word of mouth okay now lets look at that extreme spike from last month this was the result of a tweet where i announced a hour promotion where anyone could get my products for any price they wanted with a minimum the tweet was seen over times and it generated almost in revenue from sales this is obviously not something i can do again any time soon but it seems like it worked as a oneoff promotion my concern was that this would eat revenue from customers that would have likely bought at full price in the future and im sure there was a bit of that but the benefits from getting the product in the hands of thousands of new people appears to have countered that downside both products continue to sell at their regular rate since that promotion ended also note how the twitter product sold twice as many units as the aws product through this promotion despite both getting equal treatment from me i think this is more evidence that theres significantly more interest in the twitter topic within my organic reach next were going to look at another marketing experiment i tried with the aws product chart profit from ads the good parts of aws i started experimenting with paid ads back in january but i gave up very quickly first i couldnt find a reasonable costperclick rate amongst the popular advertising platforms except for reddit on reddit i was able to show an ad in the raws sub for about click it started quite promising but after a few days it was barely breaking even so i decided to stop then when the covid pandemic hit i heard that advertising rates were plummeting so i decided to give it another go this time i was able to show my ads for just click and the initial results were excellent i kept tweaking things to try to find more availability at higher cpc bids but eventually the rates became competitive again around midjune and i was struggling to break even if i had more time to invest in paid ads theres likely more opportunity there but for now i chose to invest my time elsewhere and i stopped the campaign the following is the chart i was watching on a daily basis to assess my ad performance chart daily profit from ads the good parts of aws finally i want to show you some of my top performing sources of direct sales the announcement tweet for my twitter product the announcement tweet for my aws product the reddit ad for my aws product this tweet where i first discounted the base price of my twitter product by the gumroad link in my twitter bio my personal website which gets almost all its traffic from my twitter bio another tweet mentioning the price discount the pay what you want tweet another tweet mentioning the twitter product the email announcing the release of my twitter product to people on the list a post on hacker news where i shared some stats from my aws product launch thank you for reading and i hope you found this useful if you have any questions ask me anything and ill try to give you my best answer

dl06pa,Entrepreneur,2019-10-21 12:59:34,i hit my first month heres every mistake i made on the way the headline is more to grab your attention than to brag because the rest of this post is not going to be nearly as sexy i wanted to write this post for people who are struggling to make their first or i want to give you an inside look to how i did this not overnight but what the ugly drawnout process looked like for me theres no getrichquick tips here theres no hacks no shortcuts im a very unlucky person who feels very lucky to be able to make this amount from my laptop at home while dealing with my endless medical issues background information about the business nameurl its my username i probably dont even show up on google also i dont have social media outside of reddit so there isnt much to look at ps not a selfpromo im booked out and not looking for more work type of business virtual assistance basically if someone needs an extra hand to do it in their business i probably do it my limitations are codedevelopment and design i am horrendous in those areas business model people pay me a flat fee of month to be their virtual assistant for a flat fee of month to write pieces of content for them email or blog only note i dont do hourly fees because i work quickly i am not going to work for because i did it in hour when someone would do the same work in hours and make when i break it down i track my hours using toggl its roughly hour per client monthly open since officially august when i started virtual assistance which leads me to the rest of this post tidbit about me for context im in my super late s single mom young kids one isnt in school yet clinically diagnosed schizobipolar bpd and ptsd this is important because i believe this is why it took me so long to get here college dropout with gpa criminal justice only legitimate job was usmc of which i only did term as a glorified dispatcher based in the usa i dont live in a huge city and rent for bedrooms is where i live to give you context about my choices for pricing starting expenses macbook air bought it on black friday in returned by original buyer mouse iphone s bought it in completely paid off squarespace domain year squarespace business hosting ssl certificate logo hired a friend to do it canva for business month llc setup misc legal stuff used zenbusiness no affiliation upwork maybe you have to pay to bid on jobs how i hit month all the mistakes made i didnt really know what a virtual assistant was or how long i had been doing it i was roughly years old homeless couch surfing and needed money fast i looked at craigslists odd jobs found a job from a now popular porn site that paid people hour with a bonus to label like porn videos in week i was making about week doing this but being young and naive spent it all at once thinking that this money would always be there then they outsourced to india and every american lost their job mistake i put all my eggs in one basket from here i continued to make this mistake i made a good amount off of fiverr only to get my account closed because a client complained about something i dont recall doing i rather not call her a liar if its on rworkonline and doesnt require a degree ive probably been there done that and continued to put all my eggs in one basket until i burned myself out mistake lack of selfcaresleep because i wanted to grindhustle burn out declining mental health poor sleep habits poor eating habits poor hygiene habits health problems etc this phase of my life was a blur but a very important blur because here i was trial and erroring different things i could do i was blogging i was messing around on twitter with tools like hootsuite and meetedgar i made websites on wordpress and wix and blogger i took hour rslavelabourstyle jobs because its all i was qualified to do if i didnt know how to do it i didnt let the client know i googled and spent hours on the forgotten corners of internet forums and reddit hoping to find the answer to a hopeless problem i didnt sleep much or slept too much my mental health went ignored i literally started hallucinating and having meltdowns which eventually led to my divorce which will be more relevant later on mistake i widely underestimated what people were willing to throw money at eventually i learned what a virtual assistant was and called myself that i also learned that a lot of people will pay you to do simple things they cant be arsed to do themselves like upload a blog post write an email or do customer support or label porn think of a virtual assistant as a virtual nanny or nurse who does everything for the businessentrepreneur so the businessentrepreneur can focus on making money youre probably wondering where i found my clients upwork craigslist seriously by this time i was making about month which is barely enough to live on i apply for food stamps to eat at this point i slogged like this for a few more years until my exhusband had a midlife crisis he kicked me and the kids out mistake being comfortable not having a savingsemergency fund my credit score sucks due to poor money decisions dont worry im subscribed to rpersonalfinance and rleanfire now to learn money handling skills so i couldnt take out a loan to move my discord friends and irl friends i dont have family its just me loaned me about altogether i told all of my clients what was happening partially so they could find a replacement or expect me to go mia to my surprise all of them immediately asked how can i help one of my clients gave me a advance on our retainer and contracted me to set up a squarespace website for another another client put together a pdf of resources for single mothers and government assistance i spent every penny i made as a virtual assistant on this move there is something life shaking about being homeless and alone which i was when i started this journey theres something terrifying about the idea of being homeless and alone especially when children are involved this is the turning point that lit a fire under my ass i set a goal to hit month by december virtual assistance clients at month a pop and writing clients at month i also take side projects that are nonretainer problem i was very fucking alone mistake underestimating the power of people being a dick thinking i knew better shitting on coaches and gurus that ive never met here was my strategy since i dont have friends ad spend money or time think of all current clients and clients from the last months who have money and never had issues paying me pitch them the month idea only one of converted but thats secured make facebook account join facebook groups per day filter them add the top engagement and where my potential clients are pinned to shortcuts add friendsday who are potential leads make a website with a landing page for my business make people laugh yeah seriously entrepreneurship is so stuffy and stuck up sometimes i needed a way to catch peoples attention help people and dont pitch because its and everyone is pitching and when you dont pitch people wonder who the hell you are and look at your profile where you can conveniently leave your url my flat fee is month i will not take a dollar less its upfront to secure me and i do not work until the next weeks biweekly is paid in full i cannot chase nonpaying clients i dont have a page by the way this is all my personal account i did this religiously for weeks and posted a lot of businessrelated memes i shared stories about labeling porn people laughed and told me they really liked my energy they felt safe i went into facebook groups and answered peoples questions and calmed them down when they had business issues my email marketing tool is not sending out my broadcasts i am not reaching over open rate in my emails all those years of googling and slogging away paid off where do coaches and gurus come in they have an audience i learned that they are not necessarily going to make you rich but they are a pay to play model i joined some girlpower group led by a guru month and bought myself into her audience i told her straight up look im trying to book out and this is what i do heres my website she blasted my info to her audience i ate a slice of humble pie and stopped doing the shitoncoaches crap my funny memes people shared them every time someone offered free coaching calls i took them up on it i wrote glowing reviews which they shared for the last month people in these circles constantly saw my name and face if these coaches and gurus with thousands of followers were vouching for me i am trustworthy and if i am trustworthy my website is worth looking at the rest was a waiting game if people emailed me i emailed back within hours if they inquired about me on facebook messenger i messaged back the same day people booked calls with me and talked to me i had to talk to a lot of people before someone finally said yes but who the fuck cares they said yes this weekend i booked out i had to decline two people this morning because i just dont have time for more clients i put them on a waitlist but now ive secured month minimum on retainer clients and im building my waitlist also paid all my friends back but this brings me to my latest mistake mistake no source of passive income and capping income ive capped myself at month so what the hell do i do now im going to create a source of passive income which i wont talk about here so it doesnt become a pitch ill attempt to scale it to month after that im going to convert my virtual assistance clients to digital marketing clients and work on commission so my income ceiling is higher ive never made more than month so i dont know what i dont know and i intend to continue making mistakes along the way also this subreddit hates coaches but the majority of my clients are coaches best part they have money i plan on hiring one who offered me a very valuable free coaching call a few weeks ago tldr i spent a lot of time learning random skill sets and then learned people will hire me for the skill set spent years doubting myself and undercharging ex kicked me and the kids out i panicked set up a website mass networked on facebook did a shitton of free calls to get free business tips from gurus bought into lowentry groups for more visibility made people laugh did even more shittons of discovery calls for potential clients answered a lot of emails and inquiries asked for help and there you have it none of this was glamorous or sexy and i took almost a decade to get to month but every journey starts somewhere right hope this was helpful to someone out there have a good one faq edit hey wow thanks for the response my email dms inbox and the comment thread here is pretty flooded but ill try to answer as many questions as possible in between my breaks the best way to get ahold of me is through email or commenting i cant quite figure out how to thread reddit messages to maintain context if someone has a better system for organizing the inbox stuff let me know to make your lives easier let me answer some faq please note that i am not an affiliate or endorsing any of the links i post its just stuff i found useful hirebuy at your own risk i want that dropshipping resource send it to me read this guide by fs i do not endorse them and their customer reviews are garbage so hire them at your own risk however their strategy on researching luxuryhighticket niches is solid if you skip this step or fudge it researching niches instead of the recommended and youre wondering why your store failed well there you go also covers how to work with suppliers and such how do you manage the kids while being a single mom i work with them instead of against them my kids are monsters after pm as most kids are due to being overstimulated and tired i get up at am and get the bulk of my work done before am my st grader is in school year old watches tv and eats breakfast which i cook in bulk so i can microwave it quickly by noon im tired my kids want my attention and i cant slog through work if they need me so i do household chores cook spend time with them during this time theyre in bed at pm and i spend the evening doing selfcare taking courses on skillshare reading etc are you hiringsubcontracting are you taking mentees yes and no first off i only work with usabased subcontractors and mentees because i cant begin to understand the cultural impact and obstacles that comes with being an overseas contractor second im looking for a very specific type of subcontractor theyve already vad for several businesses and have an interest in problemsolving a core skill every contractor needs im currently not mentoring but would highly recommend check out your local score for free mentors getting an accountability buddy in raccountabilitybuddies work exchange with a coach i did this a few times i offered unpaid va work in exchange for a coaching call this also lead to paid clients in the past because coaches big networkinfluence are you saying we should use your strategy shotgun method on facebook absolutely not you should determine where your audience is figure out how they respond and design your marketing strategy to put yourself on their radar the facebook strategy worked for me because its specific to my target audience you have to reverse engineer a strategy for your audience this requires a lot of trial by fire by the way you probably wont figure it out the first dozen times you try remember youre reading my tldr i didnt get into all the different crap i tried that didnt work like trying to run a facebook ad and paid for a lead do you have any recommended resourcesbooksguides sure rstoicism subreddit getting my mind right was a huge stepping stone for me stop whining stop complaining stop making excuses stop keeling over when things suck stop idolizing people stop caring when people talk shit or praise you be in the moment work help other people succeed rinse repeat dont buy a course get skillshare and learn what you need to learn for much cheaper read get a subscription on scribd learn copywriting itll help you write emails websites content sales pitches it is the most crucial skill to being able to sell in my opinion my favorite resource for copywriting if youre a designer warning you will throw up at the design you dont need to buy his course but if you do he does tear downs which was really valuable to me can you help me can you refer clients to me can you help me make money well tell me what youve done to help yourself first if you message me but you dont know what type of work you want to do what kind of clients you want to work with or made a lot of attempts and failures already you have to get your feet wet im not saying that to be a dick you only know what works and what doesnt by doing it you also have to be able to define a measurable way to track your successlack of if youve already jumped in the trenches and its not working sure we can shoot some ideas back and forth if youre hoping i just hand you a strategy or trust a random redditor with my referrals im sorry but that wont help you there is a difference between being handed the answer key to a test and working hard to understand the material for an exam one will build you a solid foundation the other will sustain you for a week and then youll be back to square one because you didnt learn anything will continue updating and answering questions between work
174o7vd,Entrepreneur,2023-10-10 15:36:54,i run an ai automation agency aaa my honest overview and review of this new business model i started an ai tools directory in february and then branched off that to start an ai automation agency aaa in june so far ive come across a lot of unsustainable ideas to make money with ai but at the same time a few diamonds in the rough that arent fully tapped into yet especially the aaa model thought id share this post to shine light into this new business model and share some ways you could potentially start your own agency or at the very least know who you are dealing with and how to pick and choose when you inevitably get bombarded with cold emails from them down the line foreword running an aaa does not involve using ai tools directly to generate and sell content directly that ship has sailed and unless you are happy with from fiverr every month or so it is not a real business model cry me a river but generating generic art with ai and slapping it onto a tshirt to sell on etsy wont make you a dime at the same time the aaa model will not require you to have a deep theoretical knowledge of ai or any academic degree as we are more so dealing with the practical applications of generative ai and how we can implement these into different workflows and techstacks rather than building ai models from the ground up regardless of all that common sense and a willingness to learn will help a shit ton as with anything keep in mind this will involve work and motivation as well the mindset that ai somehow means everything can be done for you on autopilot is not the right way to approach things the common theme of businesses ive seen who have successfully implemented ai into their operations is the willingess to work with ai in a way that augments their existing operations rather than flat out replace a worker or team and this is exactly the train of thought you need when working with ai as a business model however as the field is relatively unsaturated and hype surrounding ai is still fresh for enterprises right now is the prime time to start something new if generative ai interests you at all with that being said ill be going over three of the most successful aiadjacent businesses ive seen over this past year in addition to some tips and resources to point you in the right direction so wtf is an ai automation agency the ai automation agency or as some youtubers have coined it the aaa model at its core involves creating custom ai solutions for businesses i have over ai tools listed in my directory however the feedback ive received from some enterprise users is that readymade saas tools are too generic to meet their specific needs combine this with the fact virtually no smaller companies have the time or skills required to develop custom solutions right off the bat and you have yourself real demand i would say in practice the aaa model is quite similar to wordpress and even web dev agencies with the major difference being all solutions you develop will incorporate key aspects of ai and automation which brings me to my second point just ai is not enough rather than reducing the amount of time required to complete certain tasks ive seen many ai agencies make the mistake of recommending and trying to sell solutions that more likely than not increase the workload of their clients for example if you were to make an internal tool that has ai answer questions based on their knowledge base but this knowledge base has to be updated manually this is creating unnecessary work as such i think one of the key components of building successful ai solutions is incorporating the new generative aillms with the old programmtic automation think zapier apis etc finally for this business model to be successful ideally you should target a niche in which you have already worked and understand pain points and needs not only does this make it much easier to get calls booked with prospects the solutions you build will have much greater value to your clients meaning you get paid more a mistake ive seen many aaa operators make and i blame this on the get rich quick youtubers is focusing too much on a specific productized service rather than really understanding the needs of businesses the former is much done via a saas model but when going the agency route the only thing that makes sense is building custom solutions this is why i always take a consultantfirst approach you can only build once you understand what they actually need and how certain solutions may impact their operations workflows and bottomline basics of how to get started pick a niche as i mentioned previously preferably one that youve worked in before niches i know of that are actively being bombarded with cold emails include real estate ecommerce autodealerships lawyers and medical offices there is a reason for this but i will tell you straight up this business model works well if you target any whitecollar service business internal tools approach or high volume businesses customer facing tools approach setup your toolbox if you wanted to start a pressure washing business you would need a pressurewasher this is no different for those without programming knowledge ive seen two common ways aaa get setup to build one is having a network of oncall web developers whether its personal contacts or simply going to upwork or any talent sourcing agency the second is having an arsenal of nocode tools ill get to this more in a second but this works beecause at its core when we are dealing with the practical applications of ai the code is quite simple simply put start cold sales unless you have a network already this is not a step you can skip youve already picked a niche so all you have to do is find the right message keep cold emails short sweet but enticing and it will help a lot if you did step correctly and intimately understand who your audience is ill be touching base later about how you can leverage ai yourself to help you with outreach and closing the beauty of gen ai and the aaa model you dont need to be a seasoned web developer to make this business model work the large majority of solutions that sme clients want is best done using an api for an llm for the actual ai aspect the value we create with the solutions we build comes with the conceptual framework and design that not only does what they need it to but integrates smoothly with their existing techstack and workflow the actual implementation is quite straightforward once you understand the high level design and know which tools you are going to use to give you a sense even if you plan to build out these apps yourself say in python the large majority of the nitty gritty technical work has already been done for you especially if you leverage python libraries and packages that offer high level abstraction for llmrelated functions for instance calling gpt can be as little as a single line of code and there are nocode tools where these functions are simply an icon on a gui aside from understanding the capabilities and limitations of these tools and frameworks the only thing that matters is being able to put them in a way that makes sense for what you want to build which is why outsourcing and nocode tools both work in our case okay but how tf am i suppposed to actually build out these solutions now the fun part i highly recommend getting familiar with langchain and llamaindex both are python libraires that help a lot with the highlevel llm abstraction i mentioned previously the two most important aspects include being able to integrate internal data sourcesknowledge bases with llms and have llms perform autonomous actions the two most common methods respectively are rag and output parsing rag retrieval augmented generation if youve ever seen a tool that seemingly trains gpt on your own data and wonder how it all works well i have an answer from you at a high level the user query is first being fed to whats called a vector database to run vector search vector search basically lets you do semantic search where you are searching data based on meaning the vector databases then retrieves the most relevant sections of text as it relates to the user query and this text gets appended to your gpt prompt to provide extra context to the ai further with prompt engineering you can limit gpt to only generate an answer if it can be found within this extra context greatly limiting the chance of hallucination this is where ai makes random shit up aside from vector databases we can also implement rag with other data sources and retrieval methods for example sql databses via parsing the outputs of llms more on this later autonomous agents via output parsing a common need of clients has been having ai actually perform tasks rather than simply spitting out text for example with autonomous agents we can have an ecommerce chatbot do the work of a basic customer service rep ie look into orders refunds shipping at a high level whats going on is that the response of the llm is being used programmtically to determine which api to call keeping on with the ecommerce example if i wanted a chatbot to check shipping status i could have a llm response within my app not shown to the user with a prompt that outputs a random hash or string and programmatically i can determine which api call to make based on this hashstring and using the same fundamental concept as with rag i can append the the api response to a final prompt that would spit out the answer for the user how no code tools can fit in with some example solutions you can build with that being said you dont necessarily need to do all of the above by coding yourself with python libraries or otherwise however i will say that having that high level overview will help immensely when it comes to using nocode tools to do the actual work for you regardless here are a few common solutions you might build for clients as well as some nocode tools you can use to build them out ex solution ai chatbots for smes small and medium enterprises this involves creating chatbots that handle user queries lead gen and so forth with ai and will use the principles of rag at heart after getting the required data from your client ie product catalogues previous support tickets faq internal documentation you upload this into your knowledge base and write a prompt that makes sense for your use case one nocode tool that does this well is myaskai the beauty of it especially for building external chatbots is the ability to quickly ingest entire websites into your knowledge base via a sitemap and bulk uploading files essentially theyve covered the entire grunt work required to do this manually finally you can create a inline or chat widget on your clients website with a few lines of html or altneratively integrate it with a slackteams chatbot if you are going for an internal qa chatbot approach other tools you could use include botpress and voiceflow however these are less for rag and more for building out complete chatbot flows that may or may not incorporate llms both apps are essentially guis that eliminate the pain and tears and trying to implement complex flows manually and both natively incoporate ai intents and a knowledge base feature ex solution internal apps similar to the first example except we go beyond making just chatbots but tools such as report generation and really any sort of internal tool or automations that may incorporate llms for instance you can have a tool that automatically generates replies to inbound emails based on your clients knowledge base or an automation that does the same thing but for replies to instagram comments another example could be a tool that generates a description and screeenshot based on a url useful for directory sites made one for my own p getting into more advanced implementations of llms we can have tools that can generate entire drafts of reports think pages based not only on data from a knowledge base but also the writing style format and author voice of previous reports one good tool to create content generation panels for your clients would be mindstudio you can train llms via prompt engineering in a structured way with your own data to essentially fine tune them for whatever text you need it to generate furthermore it has a gui where you can dictate the entire ai flow you can also upload data sources via multiple formats including pdf csv and docx for automations that require interactions between multiple apps i recommend the og zapiermakecom if you want a nocode solution for instance for the automatic email reply generator i can have a trigger such that when an email is received a custom ai reply is generated by myaskai and finally a draft is created in my email client or for an automation where i can create a social media posts on multiple platforms based on a rss feed news feed i can implement this directly in zapier with their native gpt action see screenshot as for more complex llm flows that may require multiple layers of llms data sources and apis working together to generate a single response ie a long form page report i would recommend tools such as stack ai or flowise opensource alternative to build these solutions out essentially you get most of the functions and features of python packages such as langchain and llamaindex in a gui see screenshot for an example of a flow how the hell are you supposed to find clients with all that being said none of this matters if you cant find anyone to sell to you will have to do cold sales one way or the other especially if you are brand new to the game and what better way to sell your ai services than with ai itself if we want to integrate ai into the cold outreach process first we must identify what its good at doing and thats obviously writing a bunch of text in a short amount of time similar to the solutions that an aaa can build for its clients we can take advantage of the same principles in our own sales processes how to do outreach once youve identified your niche and their pain pointsopportunities for automation you want to craft a compelling message in which you can send via cold email and cold calls to get prospects booked on demosconsultations i wont get into too much detail in terms of exactly how to write emails or calling scripts as there are millions of resources to help with this but i will tell you a few key points you want to keep in mind when doing outreach for your aaa first you want to keep in mind that many businesses are still hesitant about ai and may not understand what it really is or how it can benefit their operations however we can take advantage of how mass media has been reporting on ai this past year at the very least people are aware that sooner or later they may have to implement ai into their businesses to stay competitive we want to frame our message in a way that introduces generative ai as a technology that can have a direct tangible and positive impact on their business although it may be hard to quantify i like to include estimates of manhours saved or costs saved at least in my final proposals to prospects times are tough right now and money is expensive so you need to have a compelling reason for businesses to get on board once youve gotten your messaging down you will want to create a list of prospects to contact tools you can use to find prospects include apolloio replyio zoominfo expensive af and linkedin sales navigator what specific job titles etc to target will depend on your niche but for smaller companies this will tend to be the owner for white collar niches ie law the professional that will be directly benefiting from the tool ie partners may be better to contact and for larger organizations you may want to target business improvement and digital transformation leadsdirectors these are the people directly in charge of projects like what you may be proposing okay so you have your message and your list and now all it comes down to is getting the good word out i wont be going into the details of how to send these out a quick google search will give you hundreds of resources for cold outreach methods however personalization is key and beyond simple dynamic variables you want to make sure you can either personalize your email campaigns directly with ai smartwriterai is an example of a tool that can do this or at the very least have the ability to import email messages programmatically alternatively ask chatgpt to make you a python script that can take in a list of emails scrape info based on their linkedin url or website and all pass this onto a gpt prompt that specifies your messaging to generate an email from there send away how tf do i close once youve got some prospects booked in on your meetings you will need to close deals with them to turn them into clients call consultation tying back to when i mentioned you want to take a consultantfirst appraoch you will want to listen closely to their goals and needs and understand their pain points this would be the first call and typically i would provide a high level overview of different solutions we could build to tacke these it really helps to have a presentation available so you can graphically demonstrate key points and key technologies i like to use plus ai for this its basically a google slides addon that can generate slide decks for you i copy and paste my default company messaging add some key points for the presentation and it comes out with pretty decent slides call demo the second call would involve a demo of one of these solutions and typically ill quickly prototype it with boilerplate code i already have otherwise ill cook something up in a nocode tool if you have a niche where one type of solution is commonly demanded it helps to have a general demo set up to be able to handle a larger volume of calls so you arent burning yourself out ill also elaborate on how the final product would look like in comparison to the demo call and beyond once the initial consultation and demo is complete you will want to alleviate any remaining concerns from your prospects and work with them to reach a final work proposal its crucial you lay out exactly what you will be building in writing and ensure the prospect understands this furthermore be clear and transparent with timelines and communication methods for the project in terms of pricing you want to take this from a valuebased approach the same solution may be worth a lot more to client a than client b furthermore you can create addons such as monthly maintenanceupgrade packages training sessions for employeees and so forth separate from the initial setup fee you would charge how you can incorporate ai into marketing your businesses beyond cold sales i highly recommend creating a funnel to capture warm leads for instance i do this currently with my ai tools directory which links directly to my ai agency and has consistent branding throughout warm leads are much more likely to close and honestly much nicer to deal with however even without an airelated website at the very least you will want to create a presence on social media and the web in general as with any agency you will want basic a professional presence a professional virtual address helps in addition to a google business profile gbp and trustpilot a gbp especially for local seo and trustpilot page also helps improve the looks of your search results immensely for gbp i recommend using profilepro which is a chrome extension you can use to automate seo work for your gbp aside from seo optimzied business descriptions based on your business it can handle qa answers responses updates and service descriptions based on local keywords privacy and legal concerns of the aaa model aside from typical concerns for agencies relating to service contracts there are a few issues especially when using nocode tools that will need to be addressed to run a successful aaa most of these surround privacy concerns when working with proprietary data in your terms with your client you will want to clearly define hosting providers and any third party tools you will be using to build their solution and a dpa with these third parties listed as subprocessors if necessary in addition you will want to implement best practices like redacting private information from data being used for building solutions in terms of addressing concerns directly from clients it helps if you host your solutions on their own servers not possible with ai tools and address the fact only chatgpt queries in the web app not openai api calls will be used to train openais models as reported by mainstream media the key here is to be open and transparent with your clients about all the tools you are using where there data will be going and make sure to get this all in writing have fun and keep an open mind before i finish this post i just want to reiterate the fact that this is not an easy way to make money running an ai agency will require hours and hours of dedication and work and constantly rearranging your schedule to meet prospect and client needs however if you are looking for a new business to run and have a knack for understanding business operations and are genuinely interested in the pracitcal applications of generative ai then i say go for it the time is ticking before aaa becomes the new dropshipping or smma and ive a firm believer that those who set foot first and establish themselves in this field will come out top and remember while thousand people may read this post only may actually take initiative and start

gqufhl,Entrepreneur,2020-05-26 10:20:57,ive been creating content on linkedin for years i came to share my learnings hey guys im going to make it short and succinct i invested a lot of time in linkedin content marketing and it is generating results so far if you have a bb product on a tight budget this miniguide can give you some ideas pros requires zero can bring customers and puts you in alwayson networking mode cons requires consistency and timeinvestment ill start with the linkedin algorithm first then get to the posting tips you need to know few things before you post note some people thought the post is about the articles on linkedin but im talking about the regular posts only linkedin algorithm like every content platform linkedin tries to show related quality content to the users also they want to make sure to keep them on the platform as long as possible there are things you should know from my observations i noticed things here the first minutes of your content stage every time you post the linkedin feed algorithm scores it determines whether its low or highquality post stage if its marked as highquality content it appears in the feed for a short time meanwhile bots observe how your audience engages with your content stage if people in your network liked commented or shared your post linkedin decides to take your post to the next level here the more engagement brings better results stage at this point real people will review your content theyll check why your post is performing so well whether there is anything spammy if not theyll keep showing your post in related channels and itll keep getting engagements it continues like that for hours this is our observation and it drops down very quickly you can use linkedin pods or engagement communities to increase your engagement posting at the right time as you see more engagementvirality its a good idea to post when people on your list are active according to hootsuite the best time to post on linkedin is am am pm and pm est the best day for bb brands to post on linkedin is wednesday followed by tuesday the best days for bc brands to post on linkedin are monday and wednesday yes these numbers are backed by data but every audience is different if its not working for you then stop and start testing with your guts dont include a link in your post what happens when you include a link to your post people click and drift away from linkedin linkedin doesnt want that and penalizes your post by showing it to fewer people but there is a way to add links and avoid the penalty put your link in the first comment and voila thats it onwards to the content tips write in a conversational rhythm and tone people on linkedin are not wearing serious faces theyre pretty loose and like to read conversational tone understand the harmony between long and short sentences then write like youre writing a friend write like youre talking here is a legendary example from the author gary provost that explains the importance of flow love this use simple words big words dont make the writer look smarter and annoy the reader so be simple our brain always wants to preserve more energy as a result it chooses the easier option so never indicate when you can show or obtain when you can get or eliminate when you can get rid of you get the idea plus there will be lots of nonnative speakers and readers in your network so be simple and get more engagement if you want to grade your text you can use hemingway app to calculate your readability score use the power of whitespace long posts are scary when you see a huge paragraph the first reaction is to run away from there lets make a comparison between short and long paragraphs the content of two posts youre going to see is identical without whitespace it is painful and hard to read right but you can transform the same piece to snackable bits by using whitespacealso youll get the power of rhythm and flow together with whitespace you see that one is easy on your brain it hooks you with that wavy rhythm and keeps you reading until the end start your post with an attention grabber on linkedin your first sentence is your headline when people saw your post on linkedin theyll see the first two lines and the rest will stay under the fold so your opening sentence will determine whether they continue to read or scroll down your first line should trigger the reader and make them click for more here are some ideas make them curious get specific and narrow down your audience talk about their pain points introduce news make a bold statement spark interest use emojis for a more fluid reading experience i experimented with emojis a lot they make your text easier to follow and get more engagement you can add some characteristics to your content by using them as storytelling elements or pointers example add related hashtags and tag people to increase engagement elementary but effective when you use hashtags you tell linkedin that the content you shared is relevant to that topic then if your post got enough engagement linkedin starts to send a notification to the people who are interested in that hashtag trade valuable content with comments we generated over k leads and made hundreds of new connections with this simple strategy here how it goes youll create a lead magnet ebook cheatsheet blog post etc that solves your audiences problems and youll launch it on linkedin then follow these four steps create a post with your ebook video works better make people comment to get the lead magnet scrape their comments by using dataminer send automated messages to commentators an ask for an email to send the ebook if you want to knowhow in detail you can check this article get personal linkedin is a

3r8hzo,Entrepreneur,2015-11-02 17:45:02,so were now over million per year in combined revenue crazy to even be able to type that heres how weve set ourselves apart from the competition the tools we use to accomplish this and a super transparent product launch to see how get out of the gate with projects story time tldr so this is my th post on rentrepreneur in years but in that time ive built the following companies revenues home cleaning subscription box service wetshaveclub lawn care company saas product launch another saas product groovejar and combined were doing over million per year in revenue and many of you know i did it in a crazy transparent way right here on reddit and completely bootstrapped with a couple hundred dollars in seed money today i want to share the website strategies i use to improve conversions but from the angle of a website visitor looking for a simple home cleaning this is the stuff that works regardless of the industry were in for some of you its going to be so simple as to be a waste of time but hopefully some folks get something out of this how to turn more website visitors into customers read time minutes grab your favorite puffy slippers and kick back ill get right to it i love simple predictable businesses that require no magic or fancy technology and those are the type of companies i continue to build backstory setting the stage so i wanted to attack this from the angle of a visitor to your website this visitor happens to be someone needing cleaning service cause im sure you guys are tired of wetshaveclub stuff but i promise you the stories are the same regardless of what youre selling you have someone that is looking to solve a problem youre selling something that solves that problem yet somehow your website gets in the way click to meet rosa and see the problems shes having booking service strategy for more customers use more images heres the thing people rarely read a full paragraph online even the most compelling news story is skimmed and best believe people are skimming on your website as well so we keep things as light on text as possible while setting the mood with images click to see a quick example of images we use strategy for more customers use more videos so this one will automatically set your website apart from about of your competition videos are super easy to make and they completely raise the trust level on your website and engage the customer at a much deeper level than just having traditional text testimonials these could be short second snippets like the one rosa might see or longer form ones like we did for wet shave club strategy for more customers borrowing credibility so this one is pretty straightforward but youll be surprised how many websites either miss this completely or hide these logos on inner pages that no one ever sees for us if it does not happen on the homepage it could as well not happen at all we borrow credibility from other sites that have mentioned us that rosa would immediately recognize and this would increase our standing in her eyes right away simple stuff but it works click to see how we borrow credibility from bigger sites strategy for more customers answer objections so far so good and really were only a few seconds in real time as rosa starts to take in our website shes probably feeling okay at this point but there are still certain high level questions she has in our mind that well call objections these are the same objections that sales people have to overcome in a sales call except in this case we can overcome them in many cases with very simple markers like these click to see how we use symbols and short text to overcome objections strategy for more customers more human faces as rosa gets further and further down our website page were looking for more ways to make deep connections one way we accomplish this is with human faces people connect with people not with pictures of mops and gloves or lawnmowers or whatever tools you use to deliver your service think about it when was the last time you felt a personal connection with a wet mop so we aim for at least or people that are super happy and thats why we hit rosa with images like this strategy for more customers start checkout above the fold above the fold is just the area of your website that your visitor sees when they first get there and before they start to scroll its usually your main image with text to show what your website is about imagine your homepage is an iceberg the only part of your website you can guarantee people will see is the part thats sticking out of the water assume theyre only going to see the top of that iceberg and make sure you dont waste that opportunity to get them moving along your sales funnel for us we start the checkout process as soon as rosa lands on the page strategy for more customers short onepage checkout have a checkout form where you asked the customer questions when it could have just been you just cut your conversion rate from to and increased your cost to acquire a customer by the longer your form the less money you make keep things simple for us we do a simple onepage checkout for every website and keep things as simple as possible for rosa strategy for more customers better design and customer experience so the way i see it building a business is like being in a boat race across the atlantic fortunately most of your competitors enter the race using a website that is akin to an ugly handmade dingy with a few halfbroken oars and a ton of leaks that require them to stop every few minutes to scoop out water sad to say a lot of these folks wont make it we make sure not to create a website and make it just as shoddy as the ugly handmade dingys the competition use i dont launch until i have a freaking speedboat a professionally designed cohesively branded website with good copy and a simple process to convert visitors into buyers i want to make that race as unfair as possible so while the competition is running something like this i launch with this they dont have a cohesive brand i create a solid appealing brand they dont have a video i go get one they dont have online chat i set up online chat and on and on strategy for more customers external reviews brought onsite so this is not unique to local services by any means any big ecommerce store that can see data at this level knows of this phenomenon customer comes to the site and wants to buy leaves the site to look for reviews and rd party feedback and comes back to buy or not our goal here is to remove the need for them to leave for more research by providing the most pertinent rd party reviews right on site heres what rosa sees as she is shopping around the site strategy for more customers upsells addons so this one is kind of a nobrainer but were looking to increase our average transaction size in any way we can and one way is to upsell at checkout rosa as shes checking out will have the opportunity to add extras and complementary services click to see extras we offer rosa at checkout strategy for more customers cart abandonment and instant discounts in exchange for the sale say someone starts to book service enters their email or for some reason or not they dont complete the checkout using carthook we grab their email and automatically send them follow up emails to remindincentivize them to complete the booking this not only improves conversion rates but allows us to track the overall performance of our booking form to see how well it is working if you start filling out the form you should finishand carthook helps with that tracking and management click to see this in action strategy for more customers exit monitors emails peeps little messages that are the closest thing we have to free atms in the internet marketing world and these are atms that you go back to over and over and over again insert some nice words with beautifully designed images hit sendand wait if done right sometimes in mere minutes money flows out the machine there is no single better converting medium that a wellnurtured email list nothing beats it not search not social media not display ads nada and its not even close click to see how we use exit monitors to grab customer emails just before they leave strategy for more customers refer a friend another absolute nobrainer but this works like a charm nothing beats a recommendation from a client so we set up a way for customers to get a credit off future service for each client they refer our way the new client gets a discount as well here is the email we send out to get this moving strategy for more customers show other customer transactions this is a fairly new strategy weve seen on travelocity and other major ecommerce sites and we figured we would try it out and it works like a charm its basically a way for customers to see that other customers are also buying stuff and it gives folks more confidence to get moving here is what our friend rosa would see strategy for more customers built in recurring revenue we try to build a recurring component into every business even if youre selling oneoff items like cars try to upsell a monthly service package of some sort to keep that relationship alive and one way to structure this is to give different commitment levels with higher discounts based on the lenght of the commitment so for example a year subscription is per month while a months subscription is per month this works beautifully helps to increase conversion rates for longer commitments which in turn makes our cashflow smoother and more predictable and of course if you can have your recurring transaction happen seamlessly or with one click youre way ahead of the game heres what rosa sees when its time for her to book another service wrapup so if this is executed properly it ends with a happy rosa having more time for her friends because we delivered a seamless website experience everybody wins so hopefully you guys see and sorry if this was simplistic for some of the internet marketing gurus out there that building a successful online business is far more than just throwing up a website and pulling up the brink trucks to collect the cash a great website is just the beginning a lot of what we do to get over that hump happens with the tools and ideas i laid out here good luck end of case study this wraps up the case study but i wanted to add this section because i think it may be helpful for some of you guys as you are getting out the gate and what would be one of my case studies without a rant fear is mostly a lie and i say mostly because its useful in some very specific scenarios being chased by lions in the plains of africa fear is a super helpful thing it triggers adrenaline glands to make your body do some amazing things beyond situations like this though and especially for new entrepreneurs fear is a lie its by and large a cognitive error that exists in our heads that essentially creates a fantastically negative story about all the bad things that happen if your business fails but as someone who has gone through business failures before heres what really happens nothing like kevin says fear of a business failing is like being afraid of the dark theres nothing there so what do i do after i try something and it doesnt work i wrap things up go catch a movie or something and by the next day im thinking about whats the next thing because in reality in the big scheme of things none of this matters the earth will still take a year to revolve around the sun the tides will still come in and go out and the next business opportunity will still be there waiting to be attacked i can hear some folks say well i dont have much money so im afraid of trying something and losing the money meh if you start businesses like we do youre never in more than a few hundred to a few thousand dollars to start something we build businesses that heavily weighted towards success being determined by timeeffort not some huge wad of cash and so what if you lose a bit of money building something and failed many of you dropped k k on college without blinking an eyelid and came out not having the first idea how to actually earn a living that is not dependent on having a boss but somehow the idea of k to start your own business with a chance to fully control your lives and the thought of losing that is crippling makes zero sense you probably paid k to comcast in the past months anyhow lol by the way the reality of business building for me wasnt launch a business and win it was more launch fail launch fail launch fail win win win what happened with all of those failures i got better accumulated a host of experience learned a lot and now wins come a lot easier so for k i end up learning a shit ton more than i learned in years and k at college and thats the win launching a business is the cheapest mba youll ever get so at the end of the day look to launch get failures out of the way learn and get to winning the real world is where its at with folks like myself and kevin pereira and others here that have gone through this so many times and are open to share you get to reduce the chances of failure embrace that but you have to get closer to the not giving a fuck attitude we have and enjoy the experience for what it is and and yes im wrapping it up with kanye once again people are so afraid to lose that they dont even try and as usual if i can answer any questions fire away tools and resources local platform wwwconvertlabsio join me to do this in real time more readings if youre a sucker for punishment heres my other big case study keep in touch my personal blog

s27yv8,Entrepreneur,2022-01-12 14:46:55,discord is worth billion years ago they got their first users through reddit discord was created by two avid gamers and its got a great startup story the chat app actually emerged from a gaming studio run by discords founders the studio developed a multiplayer game with an inbuilt voice function to help players communicate after realizing that the best part of their game was the inbuilt chat they focused on building that feature into a product and so they created discord a way for gamers to communicate with each other more easily the platform featured a clean easytonavigate design it was also completely free to use discord launched through reddit in the launch started when one of the founders friends shared a server link in the subreddit for the game final fantasy xiv hoping that people would use it to discuss a new expansion to the game once people joined the server jason citron and stan vishnevskiy discords founders were there to welcome users let them know what discord was all about and listen to their feedback as a result people started going back to reddit talking about how cool discord and its developers were this led to a couple of hundred people signing up for the platform and checking it out this way through word of mouth within the gaming community discord started growing after a lot of growth discord has gained a valuation of about billion thanks to its latest investment round of million a pretty cool story for a couple of guys that first posted about their business in a subreddit edit here are a couple of resources to learn more about discord how it works and how it started video on the story

2clqa3,Entrepreneur,2014-08-04 17:08:45,how startups such as dropbox airbnb groupon and others acquired their first users a while back i asked whether people would be interested in reading about the stories behind the launches of wellknown startups people seemed to like the idea so i went ahead and compiled some details on the user acquisition strategies used by a few of the better known companies i wrote more indepth articles but ill share the most interesting aspects here dropbox going from to waitlist signups in one night back in dropbox was struggling to get new users they were running an adsense campaign unsuccessfully for every they spent theyd acquire a user who paid for the product after going at this for a while drew houtson and his team decided to try something different drew made a simple four minute video showing off how dropbox worked because the service doesnt sound as impressive in text having a video to show off how it actually functioned worked wonders heres a link to the video another aspect of the video that is important to note is that it was tailored to the community it was being shown to drew was a member of the digg community and knew what kinds of things theyd appreciate if you pay close attention the video is full of references to things like tps reports and tom cruise it was full of inside jokes and quickly got voted to the top of digg by the next day they had new signups another thing that dropbox did that we might be able to emulate while marketing our own products is offering extra services for social shares dropbox ran an extensive campaign during which you could share the service on facebook and twitter for an additional mb of space it was something the users wanted as opposed to just giving away a peice of technology in a raffle and lead to million invitations being sent during the first days full writeup with history a few more details etc how reddit and quora got past the chicken and egg problem of having no content users quora and reddit solved the empty site no users no users empty site problem in similar ways the founders of both services spent the first months filling them with content themselves on quora the founders simply answered and asked lots of questions under their own profiles but the reddit approach was a bit more interesting instead of just using their own accounts the founders would create fake users to make it look like there were multiple people submitting links their submit link form featured a third slot username according to steve huffman reddit cofounder it took several months until they didnt have to submit content themselves to fill up the front page they also focused on keeping everybody in the same place in the beginning reddit had no subreddits and quora was mostly focused on technology instead of having users spread out everyone was in the same place making the community feel bigger than it was quora and reddit writeup foursquare foursquare took the old concept of local apps and added several interesting features that really attracted attention like the badges becoming the mayor or the person who checks in the most at a certain place quickly became an addiction for people they also gave merchants the opportunity to interact with their customers a lot better than most apps after the business claimed their foursquare page they could interact with the people who were checking in at their establishment whether they just wanted to chat with their most active customers or actually wanted to reward people who check in and lastly a huge part of foursquares growth was due to their city by city strategy every time they expanded to a new city they had a huge amount of new users signing up due to the word of mouth effect have you heard that foursquare just came to our city and local media covering the app foursquare writeup groupon started with a local mvp i really like the story behind groupon because it is a great example of the things we repeat on this subreddit so much start local and make a minimal viable product groupon started as local as they could get they went around the office building that they were renting a space in asking people to sign up their first campaign halfpriced pizzas at the restaurant on the first floor the first signups came from here after that they stuck to focusing on local products and services because big companies such as amazon or walmart were able to negotiate such low prices not even a big groupbuying website could compete with them when it came to items such as televisions and phones so instead groupon focused on unique products from local businesses a lot of these smaller establishments had never even tried marketing so groupons offer was enticing they were able to negotiate much better prices as far as the mvp goes andrew mason didnt want to waste time developing a full platform around the groupon idea instead of trying to build a big team like he had with his first business venture he got a few people together and set up a wordpress blog that the team would post offers on coupons were individually emailed and no one had a clear idea of what their role or title in the company really was they spent their first months focusing on seeing how many users they could get as quickly as possible in order to validate the idea and then started looking into the business side of the company once it was clear that they were onto something big and lastly groupon focused on offers that were inherently social early on they had deals for things like cafes restaurants or movies these are all things that you invite other people to so it naturally lead to people sharing the website groupon writeup tinder tinder had two things going for it it started local and it was dead simple the app did a great job at taking the tired concept of dating online and redoing it completely instead of directories of people and search you simply have a persons image appear and you swipe left or right its basically the same feature that made hotornot and facemash fun brought to mobile the double optin feature helped with the problem that lots of users have on traditional dating websites if you are an attractive female youre swamped with messages if youre a guy who isnt having a lot of luck on the website most of your messages go unanswered because you arent able to message somebody on tinder without them also liking you both these problems were solved to a large extent and more interestingly tinder also started locally having users in a small space is a lot better for this kind of app than having spread out users heres my favorite part they threw exclusive parties at usc to enter you had to install tinder on your phone you can just imagine the amount of wordofmouth they got out of that tinder writeup airbnb used another platform craigslist to get early users i also found airbnbs strategy interesting unlike with reddit and quora putting up fake offers wasnt going to work so instead they did something a bit different they used a marketplace that already had a lot of vacation homes to grow craigslist a lot of the people who posted their homes on craigslists vacation homes section received an odd email from a big fan of airbnb i am emailing you because you have one of the nicest listings in craigslist in the tahoe area and i want to recommend you feature it to one of the largest vacation rental marketplaces on the web airbnb the site already has page views a month check it out here each one came accompanied by a semianonymous gmail account such as jill d the thing is these messages worked lots of people started posting their homes on airbnb as well as craigslist which solved the big problem of having users check for places only to find an empty website the supply side is a lot harder to fill up on a website like airbnb and as a side note one thing that also helped early on was going around to users homes and helping them with their photos this is a great example of doing things that dont scale early on they went from a week to after updating their website with the new photos for each offering it might not seem that big considering the money airbnb makes today but i know that a lot of rentrepreneur users would love that kind of increase in profit airbnb writeup those are the ones i have done so far i enjoyed digging around to see exactly how they were able to get such large numbers of users in such little amounts of time in the original thread i mentioned that i was thinking about posting these on some website related to startup stories i might do that someday if i get enough content written and people like these but for now i just posted them on a personal site so that people can read them good enough for me takeaway the whole point of this is to look at what successful startups did and see if we can apply it to our own marketing some key points to consider try making a video to explain your service if text isnt doing it justice and if you do make sure to target the community youll be sharing to the best way to make your new community not look like a ghost town is to fill it up yourself whether you take the reddit approach of fake users or go with quoras team of active members depends on what kind of community it is having fake users on quora an important aspect of which is credentials for every user wouldnt have worked is there already an existing user base on another service that you can tap into try taking airbnbs approach and seeing if you can get some of them onto your website when doing this its important to note that what youre offering should be better in some way local is key in a lot of these stories its much easier and cheaper to focus on one subset of people than trying to get them all

1fz8h4g,Entrepreneur,2024-10-08 19:34:55,nuggets that would have made me successful twice as fast over the past few years ive bootstrapped several ventures to multiple six figures but looking back there are a few things i wish someone had pulled me aside and shared from day one as an entrepreneur if i could choose one superpower it would be the ability to see the future just imagine being able to peek ahead and know exactly what would lead to success and what to avoid while i write this i can think of things that without a doubt would have cut my path to success by at least half had i known them from the very start if youre just starting off in a way this is my opportunity to pay it forward and give that superpower to you so here they are in no particular order of importance you dont get ideas by trying to think of them dont try to think your way to an idea stop waiting for that lightbulb moment great ideas come from finding painful problems that people want solved the more painful the problem the easier it is to turn into a profitable business pick a niche or point of interest ask questions to find problems offer a solution to said problem you dont need money to make money you dont need an investment to start a business sure later on youll want to reinvest to grow but at the start your main focus should be getting money coming in and thanks to this internet thing you can get a business off the ground for the price of a domain and website its not saturated you just need to go deeper when you look at things at surface level it seems like everything is saturated but if you go deeper youll find opportunities everywhere for example everyone knows the fitness industry is saturated with gyms and trainers everywhere but if you zoom in on personal training theres a little less competition go even further into personal training for seniors the competition gets even thinner and if you narrow it down to seniors who want balance and mobility training youre really starting to carve out your own category of one you do not matter people are naturally selfinterested this isnt a bad thing its a hard wired survival mechanism if you want to make money your own point of view does not matter think of it like fishing you dont bait the hook with what you like you use what the fish like find out what people desire and give it to them the only thing standing between your success is you some might call this woo woo stuff but ive met plenty of people who are extremely successful yet not necessarily higher iq than the average person the only difference is that they have intense belief in themselves almost to a point others might call delusion start cultivating an honest deep rooted belief that you deserve success anything less is selfsabotage expensive cheap it takes almost the same amount of effort energy to sell something for as it does for if your goal is ask yourself would you rather manage customers or your estimation of how long a task will take directly influences how long it actually takes your mind sets the limits for everything if you believe a task will take three weeks thats exactly how long it will drag out for in reality most things can be accomplished in at least half the time set tight deadlines ones that almost feel stressful youll be amazed at how much faster and more efficiently you can get things done when you challenge your own expectations its not about how hard you work whats more important is what youre working on working hard is important but no amount of effort will pay off if youre working hard on the wrong thing its like running full speed in the wrong direction a lot of times people work on the wrong things because the way they came up with their idea was fundamentally flawed at its core reread

invvmd,Entrepreneur,2020-09-06 22:53:14,my mr miyagi died heres business lessons i learned from one of the most influential businessmen that ive had the pleasure to come across at the ripe age of a few weeks from a local sushi restaurant took a chance on me with absolutely no serving experience whatsoever thanks to a recommendation by a friend i had landed the job my previous job had been in a local country club i was responsible for basic busboy duties making per hour mw at the time i knew that in order to get out of my current situation poverty i had to become a server this restaurant was known for having strict management but the quality of their food and reputation in town made way for a server working there to make great money it was a bragging point of my friend who had referred me of how much money she was making in order to secure the job i had to pass the infamous menu test that many fail it is a straight on with the owner face to face you either know the sushi menu or you dont so having never eating sushi or attempting to learn about it for that matter i set my mind to it i couldnt afford not to get this job i created over flash cards determined to get the job and pass the test i had never worked harder for anything in my life i remember vividly studying flash card after flash card as i awaited outside counting down the minutes until it was time for me to walk through the door the standard was set early on this place meant business if you were to get a job there you earned it nothing was given to you the chinese owned restaurant was nothing short of a welloiled machine the restaurant name taking after the owner well call him lee had positioned itself to be the hottest spot in town getting to know the innerworkings of how this restaurant operated was equivalent to years in business school i had the opportunity to work alongside a man who had built an extremely successful restaurant from scratch and up until the day of his passing had maintained the same level of work ethic and outstanding reputation the restaurant is still standing after years after winning the trust of the owner and becoming somewhat of a protege in my early years of working for him i had the opportunity to become a general manager of his second restaurant a bar grill i had full authority to hire fire and run the restaurant as if it were my own thankful to have garnished knowledge learned from lee i thought it would be something of value to share some important lessons with you i now own and operate my own painting business with employees without learning from lee i know for sure i wouldnt be nearly as successful as i am today although i didnt pursue the restaurant business in his footsteps the lessons ive gathered can translate to any business lesson separate business pleasure working under lee i learned very quickly that he never mixed business with pleasure he knew that if he were to compromise on that value he would lose respect amongst his team once a business owner loses respect amongst his or her team it can never be restored to the same level it was there will always be that thing let me give you an example of how this hit home for me after the general manager job at his bar grill i moved to another city that happened to be a college town thankfully because i had the experience of management i was able to land a job at another restaurant fairly quickly having only had the experience working with lee i had high expectations for how other restaurants were ran i was in for a rude awakening i had gotten hired on as an assistant manager and it didnt take long for me to see how low the standard was at the place i had gotten hired within a week of working there the general manager above me and the owners of the restaurant had engaged in partying with the staff taking shots on the clock and fraternizing when it came time for the general manager to discipline the staff for being late or for making mistakes it almost came across as a joke i would read the reaction of the person being reprimanded and it was never taken seriously even when the general manager would give me direction or ask me to do things after seeing this behavior i never looked at him the same my approach was completely different i knew this fundamental principle of business i saw it through lee he never mixed business with pleasure you would never see him out with the staff after work or fraternizing at any level because of this there was this separation between boss and staff which is necessary for running a business some may say this is crazy i work so closely with my staff theyre like family it would be weird if i didnt spend time with them outside of work theres a difference between spending time and making a fool of yourself to where your credibility is lost my advice know the difference between the two lesson every problem comes with the gift of knowledge there was one thing about lee that i admired that stood out from the rest when things were crazy hectic or something was completely going wrong he always had an answer he always made sure his team felt calm he would bear the stress that came with the issue he knew that if he showed any sign of weakness in that moment his team would crumble he knew that the best way to handle a situation was through calm and deliberate action he also made sure to use every problem as a teaching moment to make you think to make you learn how to solve the problem on your own he never made it that simple to where he would just solve the problem for you as a business owner now i always think about that any time my team calls me with an issue i think about his approach how hed respond how hed handled it and i emulate that i start by listening to the concern and having an internal rating of of how urgent the matter is to my employee or worker they might see it as a to me i have to see it for what it really is how much do i need to personally get involved can this employee solve this issue without me these are a few questions that run through my head i then lock in the solution to the problem or my very best calculated risk i then redirect the concern back on the person bringing up the issue and challenge them to figure it out on their own only until after they make their own attempt to solve the issue will i step in this not only creates better leaders within my organization it creates this level of independence that will mitigate future calls and concerns when a low level issue arises lesson know every aspect of your business one of my greatest philosophies i teach to my small following on ig is surrounded by this lesson here the ability to truly know and understand the ins and outs of your business if youve ever read one of my posts regarding this topic youd know that i use the analogy of the restaurant owner who knows who to cook the reason why i use this analogy is if you own a restaurant and you dont know how to cook and your chef decides not to show up your patrons arent eating one thing about lee was that he knew every single aspect of his restaurant i always respected that there were times wed see him cooking in the kitchen to help the kitchen catch up on orders other times we would see him with plumbing equipment fixing the plumbing in the bathrooms on really busy nights youd find him at the host counter seating and directing customers hed jump behind the bar to help the bartender make drinks he was a master of truly every aspect of his business the beauty of this is that he had full control or as close as you can possibly get of a potential outcome if the toilet was overflowing in the middle of a crazy busy service were not waiting for a plumber if the host is completely overwhelmed by all the bookings were not screwed for the night if the bartender was slammed people could still order drinks this has translated more than anything to me in my painting business when i first started my painting business i had absolutely no idea how to paint but having paid attention to lee i knew that if i were to be successful i had to learn this was no question so i did i spent months with my team actually doing the painting i did everything from spraying brushing prepping rolling cutting along with the many other aspects of my business leads phone marketing salesi now have the most important aspect locked in production so should something happen to where my team doesnt show up im still in control my business wont be compromised because my lack of knowledge or my lack of care to learn this guy was more than just a boss he led by example his methodology was different than the norm i have yet to come across anyone who is a harder worker or more dedicated to the success of their business im truly saddened to see such an impactful person pass on but im very thankful because his passing has cemented his teachings more than they were before i hope this has helped someone out there in his memory if youve read this far i want to share one more thing in the karate kid there was a moment where the teacher and the kid did the wax on wax off when i first started at the end of the night we were responsible to clean all of the tables i thought i knew how to do it you know having been a busboy before and all i dunked the rag into the water and went at it i hear boots walking toward me it was lee obviously extremely nervous and intimidated i stopped what i was doingsir youre doing it wrongdo it this way this man literally grabbed the towel folded it into a perfect square and in the most perfect way wiped this table that left no overlay on the water no extra suds this was my wax on wax off moment from there i learned that the secret to his greatness was in the details tldr my old boss passed away he was extremely influential in my life and his teachings have translated into my own business today
137jznb,Entrepreneur,2023-05-04 13:01:31,the best actually free ai tools to launch scale and run your businesses side projects more efficiently ive seen a bunch of lists of the best ai tools that focus on paidsubscription tools that are harder to experiment with without paying and wanted to compile the best completely free tools ive found some of these still have paidpro plans but all can be used completely free without a time limited trial and dont require a credit card to do so if youre like me and looking to experiment with using ai to improve your business check these out and let me know your thoughts if there are any other ai tools or resources im missing please comment them below and i can add them to the list business domain name generation namingmagic i know ai name generators are somewhat played out and most of you already know about them but namingmagic stands out as an option that automatically generates names with domain names you can actually register its also completely free namelix is another business name generator thats been around years while its a bit harder to find names for which nondotcom domains are available with it namelix has the best interface here and makes it easy to choose different styles of names project management integrating ai into your workflows taskade i use taskade to organize everything from todo lists to outreach emails meeting notes and content creation similar to notion its an allinone content platform that lets you write collaborate and keep track of everything you need to get done i find its ai functionality which is actually powered by chatgpt to be much better than notions taskade also has gpt builtin to the free plan so is a great way to get to use gpt without paying for chatgpts pro plan which is required to use on their site while they claim theres a limit of monthly ai generations on the free plan i have yet to run into the limit even using it for all of my content generation chatgpt prompts taskade also has hundreds of free templates that let you easily set up workspaces that integrate ai even if you dont end up using a specific template its a nice way to see whats possible in integrating ai into your workflows and see how others are doing so ai site builders to be honest i continue to use woocommerce for most of my sites as im familiar enough with it that i can use templates and build stuff quickly that way if however you tend to get stuck when building sites there are a few ai powered site generators that might be worth trying out jimdo ive heard people recommend jimdo which does offer a free plan though you have to use their subdomains to do it jimdo has both a standard website and online store builder web is another option that focuses on ai powered wordpress websites and has a free trial that you can try ai powered ab testing i think where ai will really shine in web development is in ab testing for example automatically identifying tests you can run and making tweaks to your site based on the results i have yet to find a tool that does it well that isnt expensive but if any of you have seen examples of this let me know and i can add them to the list image and illustration generator for your nonproduct content dalle like chatgpt dalle is built by openai and has a free plan that lets you try it out without paying essentially dalle lets you create aigenerated images and illustrations in whatever style you want i find dalle especially useful for creating illustrations to put in the headers of articles that help catch readers attention and generally create blog content that stands out more to readers and search engines you can see examples of illustrations and the prompts used to create them on openais site while its not my space this could be a gamechanger for those doing things like writing illustrated kids books or creating games that require large volumes of illustrations texttospeech and voiceover content generation murf aipowered texttospeech that lets you choose from hundreds of different voices tones purposes accents and so on it also works with different languages so is perfect if youre targeting nonenglish speaking markets if youre like me and dont have the gift of a golden voice murf is an excellent alternative that works for creating product videos ads and anything else where you need spoken audio researching and answering technical questions with sources phind i found this one on yc hackernews phind bills itself as a search engine that tells you the answer something like a cross between chatgpt and google i use it most for answering development related questions where it really shines vs chatgpt vanilla is in showing you the sources it uses to generate answers so you can explore things further yourself vs chatgpt where it can be harder to tell when its hallucinating that also means it gets sources that are uptodate vs chatgpts pretrained model which is limited to data available before september written content and copy generators unbounce unbounces ai copywriting tool generates website content including headings descriptions and so on in addition it will generate matching email marketing campaigns and other offsite copy to match whats on your site while its unlikely itll do absolutely everything you need with some tweaks unbounce can save a bunch of time if youre looking to spin up a new site quickly to validate a new idea or product copyai copyai has similar writing functionality to chatgpt but focuses specifically on business writing use cases like emails marketing copy and blog content as a result it has some features chatgpt doesnt like being able to scrape leads sites to personalize sales emails its free plan is limited to words per month but its still worth trying out if youre looking for this kind of functionality rytr is another similar option that limits you to characters per month ive tried both and found them to be better than chatgpt for certain specific use cases like generating email copy ymmv but its worth trying if you havent gotten the results you want with chatgpt business ideas research and feedback there are some purpose built tools for this but i have yet to find one that does better than simply using chatgptphindtaskade and prompting it with your ideas you can then ask for feedback either generally or on specific parts of your idea one method ive found particularly useful when im exploring a new productsite idea is to use the prompt mindmap on taskade to whip up a mind map of things to research for a new idea then use phind to research specific questions where i need recent url sources like research into competitors in a space the template i used to build the mind maps is here if any of you have tried one thats worth using let me know and ill add it also thinking of making this into a google sheet or github if any of you would like to contribute to an ongoing list of ai tools that can be used entirely for free tldr namelixnamingmagic for finding business names with domain names you can register taskade for integrating chatgptai into your workflows projects and task management murf for aipowered texttospeech and voiceovers dalle for ai generated imagesillustrations phind for researching topics and getting sourced aipowered answers copyairytr for copymarketingsales specific content

poeihp,Entrepreneur,2021-09-14 23:44:31,months ago i was unemployed last week my side hustle got acquired by a m fintech company ive learned so much over the years from this subreddit i thought id return the favour and share some of my own learnings in november my best friend and i had an idea what if we could find out which stocks the internet is talking about this formed the origins of ticker nerd months later we sold ticker nerd to finder an australian fintech company valued at around m in this post i am going to lay out how we got there how we came up with the idea first off like other posts have covered you dont need a revolutionary or original idea to build a business there are tonnes of boring businesses making over figures a year eg law firms marketing agencies real estate companies etc if youre looking for an exact formula to come up with a great business idea im sorry but it doesnt exist finding new business opportunities is more of an art than a science although there are ways you can make it easier to find inspiration below are the same resources i use for inspiration i rarely ever come up with ideas without first searching one of the resources below for inspiration starter story twitter startup ideas my first million trends by the hustle trends vc to show how you how messy random and unpredictable it can be to find an idea let me explain how my cofounder and i came up with the idea for ticker nerd we discovered a new product on twitter called exploding topics it was a newsletter that uses a bunch of software and algorithms to find trends that are growing quickly before they hit the mainstream i had recently listened to a podcast episode from my first million where they spoke about motley fool making hundreds of millions from their investment newsletters we asked ourselves what if we could build a saas platform similar to exploding topics but it focused on stocks we built a quick landing page using carrd gumroad that explained what our new idea will do and included a payment option to get early access for we called it exploding stock lol we shared it around a bunch of facebook groups and subreddits we made in presales within a couple days my cofounder and i cant code so we had to find a developer to build our idea we interviewed a bunch of potential candidates meanwhile i was trawling through wall street bets and found a bunch of free tools that did roughly what we wanted to build instead of building another saas tool that did the same thing as these free tools we decided to pivot from our original idea our new idea a paid newsletter that sends a weekly report that summarises of the best stocks that are growing in interest on the internet we emailed everyone who preordered access telling them about the change and offered a full refund if they wanted tldr we essentially combined two existing businesses exploding topics and motley fool and made it way better we validated the idea by finding out if people will actually pay money for it before we decided to build it the idea we started out with changed over time how to work out if your idea will actually make money its easy to get hung up on designing the logo or choosing the perfect domain name for your new idea at this stage none of that matters the most important thing is working out if people will pay money for it this is where validation comes in we usually validate ideas using carrd it lets you build a simple one page site without having to code the ticker nerd site was actually built using a carrd template heres how you can do it yourself at a high level create a carrd pro account yes its a one off payment but youll get way more value out of it buy a cheap template and send it to your carrd account you can build your own template but this will save you a lot of time once the template reaches your carrd account duplicate it leave the original so it can be duplicated for other ideas jump onto canva free and create a logo using the free logos provided import your logo add copy to the page that explains your idea use the aida formula sign up to gumroad free and create a presale campaign create a discounted lifetime subscription or version of the product this will be used presales add the copy from the site into the presale campaign on gumroad add a widget to carrd and connect it to gumroad using the existing easy integration feature purchase a domain name connect it to carrd test the site works share your website now the site is ready you can start promoting it in various places to see how the market reacts an easy method is to find relevant subreddits using anvaka github tool or subreddit stats the anvaka tool provides a spider map of all the connected subreddits that users are active in the highlighted ones are most relevant you can post a thread in these subreddits that offer value or can generate discussion for example im creating a tool that can write all your copy would anyone actually use this what does everything think of using ai to get our copy written faster its time to scratch my own itch im creating a tool that writes marketing copy using gpt what are the biggest problems you face writing marketing copy ill build a solution for it reddit is pretty brutal these days so make sure the post is genuine and only drop your link in the comments or in the post if it seems natural if people are interested theyll ask for the link another great place to post is rentrepreuerridealong and rbusiness_ideas these subreddits expect people to share their ideas and youll likely make some sales straight off the bat i also suggest posting in some facebook groups related to your idea as well just for good measure assess the results if people are paying you for early access you can assume that its worth building your idea the beauty of posting your idea on reddit or in facebook groups is youll quickly learn why people lovehate your idea this can help you decide how to tweak the idea or if you should drop it and move on to the next one how we got our first customers for free by validating ticker nerd using subreddits and facebook groups this gave us our first paying customers but we knew this wouldnt be sustainable we sat down and brainstormed every organic strategy we could use to get traction as quickly as possible the winner a product hunt launch a successful product hunt launch isnt easy you need someone that has a solid reputation and audience to hunt your product essentially an endorsement an aged product hunt account you cant post any products if your account is less than a week old to be following relevant product hunt members since they get notified when you launch a new product if theyre following you relationships with other builders and makers on product hunt that also have a solid reputation and following although if you can pull it off you can get your idea in front of tens of thousands of people actively looking for new products over the next few weeks i worked with my cofounder on connecting with different founders indie hackers and entrepreneurs mainly via twitter we explained to them our plans for the product hunt launch and managed to get a small army of people ready to upvote our product on launch day we were both nervous on the day of the launch we told ourselves to have zero expectations the worst that could happen was no one signed up and we were in the same position as were in now luckily within a couple of hours ticker nerd was on the homepage of product hunt and in the top the results were instant after hours we had around people enter their payment details to sign up for our free trial these signups were equal to around in monthly recurring revenue i hope this post was useful drop any questions you have below and ill do my best to respond

1k98rho,wallstreetbets,2025-04-27 17:01:31,whos setting the price of individual largecap stocks in if youre on this sub you probably know all about the ability of retain traders to move the price of small and midcap stocks but the bigger a stock is the harder it is for retail traders to move its price and lot of retail trading takes the form of two actions put money in and pull money outmeaning its one thing for retail traders to affect the overall level of the sp or nasdaq but its a lot less clear what determines the price of the stocks in those indices relative to each other i expect someone to chime in with market makers but a lot of people seem confused about how market makers make money market makers live to make money off people who have no idea what theyre doing and live in fear of trading with anyone who has any idea whats going on the traditional way they react to news is by trading less now the react to news by trading less thing often isnt symmetrical if news seems good neutral at worse market makers can raise their asks while leaving their bids be at least until theyve gotten a chance to see how everyone reacts if news seems bad neutral at best they can do the opposite but ultimately theyre just guessing what other people will doand they dont even care about what other people will do in a year a month even a week at most they care about what will happen tomorrow and only if theyre providing liquidity for a really big trade where their position will take time to unwind so they might be part of the story but not as much as people thing another answer is big institutional investors this was almost certainly the correct answer years ago since then however two things have happened the first is the rise of index funds which now control a majority of the assets managed by mutual funds but on top of that theres closet indexersmutual funds that are technically actively managed but whose portfolios look a lot like index funds because their managers incentives are mostly on the side of not underperforming their benchmarks too much still even if only of the money in the stock market is being genuinely actively managed by professional investors thats still a lot how much do they move the market i honestly dont know theres absolutely no question if somebody drops a market order to buy or sell a million shares of something that person will wind up trading through the order book and causing a big price swing but that literally never happens except by accident its called fat fingering for a reason if you want to trade a million shares of something on purpose maybe you call around trying to find the best quote or maybe you trade in a dark pool or maybe you have a computer that lets you enter a trade and have the computer do the trade gradually a little bit at a time at semirandom interval in semirandom lots with a semirandom mix of market orders and limit orders with semirandom prices all in service of making your one big trade look like a bunch of little trades in order to trick the market makers who as noted above are living in fear of accidentally trading with you i have heard such things exist though i am speculating somewhat on the details how much do genuine actively managed funds move the price of individual largecap stocks when they use those tactics beats me and thats all i got what do people think

1k8fd10,wallstreetbets,2025-04-26 15:20:07,why theres a good chance trump kills any deals bessent brings him when it comes to trumps tariffs on americas largest trading partners there was not a lot of good news this week no ones even pretending to have hope on canada and mexico the eu is signaling theyll be patient but its pretty clear by that they mean theyre willing to patiently wait for trump to back down and china responded to trump claiming talks were going well by denying talks were happening at all its also been reported that china is lifting its own retaliatory tariffs on some semiconductors and some pharmaceuticals but that seems to be a matter of reducing the pain tariffs cause for china while keeping the pain on the for the us when it comes to americas second tier of trading partnerscountries like india and japantheres more reason for optimism talks are at least actually happening unfortunately whether any deals actually happen probably depends on how convincingly everyone else involved can lie to trump and convince him the deals will do what he wants when clearly no deal will do any such thing the problem here is that trumps stated goal is the total elimination of the us trade deficitnot that he regularly uses technical jargon like trade deficit but he talks constantly how much money were losing from trade and when he gives numbers they generally appear to be based on real statistics about the trade deficit for example when trump announced new tariffs on almost every country in the world on april nd he claimed they were retaliation for other countries tariffs including currency manipulation and trade barriers but the actual numbers were just our trade deficit with each country in percentile terms trump appears to assume any trade deficit is in itself proof of unfair trade practices similarly hes consistently claimed that under biden we were losing billion a day to other countries sometimes the number is billionwhile taking questions in the oval office on tuesday the number somehow got up to billionbut billion is consistent with the actual goods trade deficit for most of the biden administration which tended to be somewhere between billion and billion for any given month its not really clear why youd want to eliminate this trade deficit since its largely being driven the us being seen as a great place to invest in creating enormous international demand for us stocks and bonds including but by no means limited to us treasuries but even if you did want to eliminate the trade deficit its not clear what a series of deals with other countries to eliminate it would even look like that means the deals us trade negotiators are currently attempting to hammer out with their foreign counterparts will not accomplish trumps stated goals that in turn means selling those deals to trump is going to depend on people bullshitting him into thinking the deals do things they will not and cannot do will it work maybe i certainly cant blame people for trying but i also cant avoid seeing the parallels with what happened with canada and mexico in february and march trump threatened them with tariffs on february st then announced a day pause after trudeau and sheinbaum offered him a bunch of concessions that consisted mostly of things they were already doing for a moment it looked like catastrophe may have been averted by the power of sheer bullshit but then on march th the tariffs went into effect on schedule two days later i went into my vanguard account and sold more or less everything abandoning my longstanding commitment to vt and chill so far i dont regret it note in the screenshot below other stocks is currently iau a gold etf with a slightly lower expense ratio than its somewhat betterknown counterpart gld
1k8cbl5,wallstreetbets,2025-04-26 12:56:24,hertz heres why im planning to get in with otm puts summary of my bear case the high short interest led to a spectacular rally following bill ackmans fund announcement of a stake in the hertz bloomberg just announced april that the company is looking to raise million through debt or and this is key equity i believe the company will dilute investors at the start of next week that will probably lead to a selloff like it is usually the case after an equity offering im planning to buy otm puts with a price target of over the next months i am not a degen despite my profile name so i need theta to be on my side baby i believe hertz could be cooked revenue is down despite decent utilization rates that means the company is renting cars at lower prices to keep demand tariffs will most likely not improve its vehicles residual values as trump may pause sectoral tariffs on autos airlines have recently reported a decline in air travel considering that of the companys revenue comes from airport locations that is another headwind to consider overall i believe the ai robotaxi infrastructure nonsense is not alligned with the companys simplification strategy i have big doubts bill ackman will be able to pursue management into this business venture fundamentals both americas and international revenues are down yoy here is the yoy variation americas q q q q international q q q q overall worldwide vehicle rental revenue is down by yoy in fy big drop compared to the increase in fy or the increase in fy from a profitability perspective ebitda things look raw to say the least just look at the trend below by the way thats earnings before depreciation when taking into account depreciation things look even more raw whats the company doin about this buy right hold right sell right strategy back to basis roadmap heres a summary metricyearend yearend target by ye of fleet year oldnot disclosed substantially complete rotation average cap cost of risk vehicles vs existingnot disclosed lowermaintain or improve cost advantage vehicles sold q depreciation per unit dpu netguided actual gross monthunit on the buy right strategy from the q earnigns call our risk vehicles have an average cap cost almost lower than our existing fleet of model year through car buys in plain english compared to the cars they bought in the new cars for cost less on average weve got committed model year buys locked in at the economics that foot to that sub dpu metric what is the dpu depreciation per vehicle per month in plain english how much a vehicle looses value per month due to depreciation the thing is dpu is not a sneeze take a look at the dpu trend below does that look scary it seems that the depreciation in the us is way more pronounced than in the eu heres the deal baby the median of the total dpu since was things changed after the pandemic you may say fair enough here is the median of the total dpu total meaning both us and international cars since q let me be clear the target of per month is only bringing back the company to the base line after the pandemic that baseline is still high compared to prepandemic levels on their hold right strategy a cars biggest value drop happens in the first years but if hertz keeps cars very new fleet mostly year old depreciation per month becomes predictable and lower from the earnings call as of yearend over of our fleet was comprised of vehicles year old or less on the sell right strategy in q alone they sold vehicles compared to just in q less than sold in auctions lower prices and they are prioritizing their retail selling channel higher prices due to addons like financing management is bullish on tariffs if tariffs increase new car prices the counterbalance is likely residual values will go up which will help our business model i am not here is why trump is chickening out of sectoral tariffs on autos after ceos complained check recent news on this topic i am seemingly now allowed to post links the bear case here is a strong pillar of my bear case take a look at utilization rates over past few years notice the seasonality which is normal wtf is the utlization rate in plain english how much a vehicle is being rented ie generating during the quarter utilization rate means that out of days the car is rented out not bad right the trend looks fine here is the yoy variation in utilization rates q q q q the trend when adjusted for seasonality is flat which is great or is it take a look at the trend in total revenue per transaction day in other words how much htz is makin per vehicle per day on average during the quarter both in americans and intl the trend looks raw heres the thing to keep the same utilization rates in other words to keep their vehicles rented out the company has to lower the daily rates to maintain demand here is the seasonally adjusted variation in revenue per transaction day in q q q q speaking of raw trends here is a chart showing interest expenses over the past few years here is the yoy variation in interest payments q q q q here is an interesting chart of the nearest debt maturities the pershing square deal bill ackmans fund owns now of htz possibly the first step of an activist campaign to influence management on the direction of the company when they reach ownership the fund must file either a d or g morgan stanley teased the ai case for the company to my eyes bs here is why it seems that the street is bullish on autonomous vehicles ie robotaxis requiring downstream fulfillment infrastructure that could be implemented at htz rental locations look hype works when the sp is hitting all time highs now hype its not a good bet teslas robotaxies are operating on teslas own infrastructure same for waymo hertz would need to burn a lot in capex to adapt their rental locations to accommodate robotaxis operations not bullish in my view here is another reason i am sketched out by the rally and this is the final pillar of my bear case according to bloomberg hertz global holdings is looking to raise m through additional debt or equity offering this is key this is a rumor its not officially announced by the company there is no k filed yet my point if the company dilutes investors now that the share price is up which is quite common just look at quantum stocks in q last year that will lead to a selloff simple as that technical analysis position i havent bought puts yet i may do on monday depending on price action and if the company files an k with their potential offering before the market opens the jun put contract looks juicy disclaimer im a degen this is not personal investment advice do not follow my bets information may be wrong do your own analysis

1k7th50,wallstreetbets,2025-04-25 19:23:19,gdpnow atlanta fed q recession thunderdome tldr the official government predictions that predict whether we are in recession or not will come out april th gdp numbers for q are reported and estimates for q are released from april th by the bea and atlanta fed q estimates will be negative because of the day tariff extension and the market hasnt realized it yet gdp c i g x m chances are we have been in a recession since january st this will become very apparent after april th not because of the q qdp report but because of the q estimates that begin to be released that day current expectations are for slight growth in q but theres good reason to think otherwise and news hits that gdp will detract it will bring the market down and fit the definition of a recession that is two quarters of negative gdp growth what has already happened at the end of last february aka the last market high the atlanta fed rapidly started dropping their gdp now estimates why because of the sharp spike in imports to the united states to preempt trumps tariffs thats the moment the market started taking trumps tariff seriously and acting on it from that moment we knew we would have at least one negative quarter of gdp growth but it takes two to tango and as long as q wouldnt be negative as well we would avoid fitting the definition of a recession from this info we know that when tariffs are announced for a future date firms will import ahead of time to get around it what is yet to happen what would cause q to be negative if importers already imported everything ahead of liberation day well the only thing i can think of that would push us down that route would be if the majority of the tariffs got pushed back by exactly one quarter at the beginning of april say i dont know days like exactly before the end of q so that importers had another opportunity to import more before the tariffs kick in again like specifically if i had to cause a recession thatd be my play book announce tariffs to kill one quarter of gdp growth and then push them back exactly one quarter to kill the next genius heres what i expect is going to happen that hasnt been priced in yet importers are going to create another large net export trade deficit to get around the day trigger consumption will decrease as americans brace for a recession and we are going to have a second negative quarter despite all expectations what it means why is fitting the actual definition of a recession bad you ask retardedly because it kills the fucking vibes consumers react to whats in the news these things compound on each other consumption is another component of gdp if one quarter is down and the next quarter is recession narrowly avoided a la the vibesession the next quarter is down were cooked because thats when news agencies go from nebulous articles about the possibly of a recession to freak the fuck out and panic sell everything we are officially in a recession right now technically the soonest the government would officially call a recession that started in is july th days after q ends when the reports get dropped heres the flip side if the gdp estimates dont go negative throughout q it will take a long time for another recession risk to form the two negative quarters have to be consecutive to meet the definition there would have to be another two quarters of negative gdp growth to kill that so if numbers dont look bad after april th bulls are gonna win this one heres how ill be wrong importers sit on their ass and dont import before the day extension is up because they already filled warehouses in q or they just dont care or foreign countries begin kissing his ass a deal gets struck and the tariffs come down or a cosmic particle strikes the neurons in trumps head like a transistor flipping in a super mario speedrun and he takes them all down how we will know heres the key part of how all this gets called the bureau of economic analysis releases their first official gdp report for a quarter days after that quarter ends and the atlanta fed begins releasing their estimates for the current quarter days after it begins that means april th is the day of days when we will know the final numbers for q which will be bad and we will know the estimates for q if the q estimates are bad on april th that is the same as the atlanta fed predicting a recession this is what we dont know but based on how importers reacted last time to change in tariffs and how the fed reacted to them i would imagine this brings down gdp estimates assumptions i am making the definition of a recession as two quarters of negative gdp growth is a good and accurate definition and that people will freak out when we are projected to meet that definition a large amount of trade deals wont get made in the next quarter importers will create a large trade deficit that brings down gdp because of the day tariff extension the market hasnt already priced this in theres plenty of reasons to expect one of those assumptions to be wrong do your own dd tell me how im wrong below positions money market since january my order ill get a biggie meal deal with the

election away from a fullblown earnings aneurysm they import of their shoes from asia so naturally a little thing called tariffs comes back on the menu and boom skechers pulled fullyear guidance citing uncertainty despite record q revenues they didnt even revise their guidance they straight up refused to provide one why well i believe that if they did provide the real guidance longterm bullish investors would scream like a little girl who just found out her ipad battery is at and shes on a hour flight with no charger and no wifi q earnings confirm tariff vulnerability executive summary five months after my original bearish thesis on skechers nyseskx at the company has reported q earnings that provide striking validation of my core predictions despite posting superficially strong revenue growth of skechers has withdrawn fullyear guidance citing macroeconomic uncertainty stemming from global trade policies explicit confirmation of my tariff vulnerability thesis with the stock now at a decline since my initial coverage the companys q results reveal the fundamental weakness i outlined is materializing even faster than anticipated q results the cracks are showing metricq resultyoy changeimpact on thesis revenue billionstrong topline masks underlying issues operating margin bpssignificant margin compression operating income millionprofitability deteriorating epsminimal growth despite revenue increase china sales millionmajor weakness in key market guidancewithdrawnnadirect confirmation of tariff thesis what stands out most is the stark disconnect between revenue growth and operating income decline revealing the margin compression that forms the cornerstone of my bear thesis this divergence confirms that skechers cant maintain profitability in the face of rising costs precisely the vulnerability that makes them uniquely exposed to tariff impacts original analysis bearbasebull case revisited lets revisit the specific assumptions from my original

days the bull case which i assigned only a probability assumed operational improvements that now appear completely unrealistic in the current tariff environment thesis validation pointbypoint tariff vulnerability explicitly confirmed the single most important validation comes from managements own words their decision to withdraw fullyear guidance specifically citing macroeconomic uncertainty stemming from global trade policies is direct confirmation of my thesis that tariffs represent an existential threat to their business model the company is acknowledging what i predicted five months ago their heavy reliance on asian manufacturing creates an unsustainable vulnerability to the current trade environment china dependency exposed managements attempt to reframe apac performance by highlighting when excluding china sales increased actually underscores their china problem china sales plummeted yearoveryear to million making it their worstperforming region by far this represents a significant deterioration in what has historically been one of their largest and most important markets the china narrative reveals an important context shift q china represented of total sales m q china now represents of total sales m this percentage point decline in chinas contribution to total sales confirms the market share erosion i predicted as local competition intensifies and skechers loses its positioning in this critical market theres even more downside risk here given their exposure to reciprocal tariffs from china lets be honestno chinese consumer especially not a patriotic boomer is going to shell out in tariffs for a shoe that looks and feels like something they could buy off a folding table outside a metro station and if thats a tough sell in china good luck convincing american shoppers to pay up either margin structure deteriorating the margin story is particularly concerning for skechers shareholders operating margin declined basis points to gross margin declined basis points to operating expenses increased far outpacing revenue growth this margin compression is occurring even before the full impact of tariffs flows through their income statement in q and beyond the companys inability to maintain margins even in a strong revenue quarter confirms my thesis that their business model lacks the pricing power to offset rising costs inventory situation inventory stood at billion down from december while this represents some improvement the absolute level remains historically elevated more concerning is the potential for future inventory build as tariffimpacted costs flow through their supply chain potentially leading to margineroding markdowns or further inventory growth short thesis vs q results comparison metricoriginal

on marginsstrong at but operating income tariff impactcentral to bear thesisexplicitly cited as reason for guidance withdrawal implications going forward the q earnings reinforce my conviction in the bear case while revenue growth was strong the rapid deterioration in margins and profitability suggests the company is already feeling the impact of higher costs even before the full brunt of tariffs hits in q and beyond managements decision to withdraw guidance indicates they see significant downside risk to their financial performance likely due to their inability to pass through tariffrelated costs without hurting demand this confirms my original thesis that skechers lacks the brand equity and pricing power needed to navigate this environment the china narrative is particularly telling by attempting to reframe apac performance to exclude china management is tacitly acknowledging the significant challenges they face in what was previously one of their most important growth markets this reinforces my view that their international expansion strategy faces structural headwinds conclusion and price target at skechers has already declined from the price months ago of but the q results confirms significant additional downside remains with margins compressing even before the full impact of tariffs my original bear case target of remains firmly in play the q report provides compelling validation of my original thesis skechers faces fundamental challenges in its business model that make it uniquely vulnerable to the current tariff environment the combination of china weakness margin compression and managements explicit acknowledgment of tariff risk through guidance withdrawal confirms the structural issues i identified are now materializing in their financial results position puts see below catalysts tariff escalation q margin pressure inventory overhang realignment outlook this isnt panic sellingits slowmotion repricing and management just gave us the signal disclaimer

out to be a positive surprise and the stock price climbs above the level it could signal a reversal of the downward trend that has been affecting the tech giants shares since the beginning of earnings for q it looks like the market is expecting alphabet to report revenue of billion yy from what ive read operating income is expected to reach billion yy this stronger profit growth implies a slight margin improvement to above pp tbh it looks like effective cost management will be one of the biggest challenges for alphabet in this environment while sustaining strong revenue growth seems less at risk managing expenses especially given capitalintensive ai development plans will be challenging cloud services for those who are aware google cloud is a thing and is driving massive growth for the company with rivals signaling a slowdown in data center expansion amid rising uncertainty alphabet may either follow a cautious strategy likely dampening growth or seize the opportunity to gain market share by acting aggressively the second approach would be riskier and more costly potentially causing erosion in the segments operating margin it would however be an investment in the better future market position im going to be watching not just the quarterly results but also the forward outlook and managements tone regarding the cloud business it looks like the forecasted cloud segment has a revenue of billion for q this would be the highest quarterly result in alphabets history however operating income is expected to slightly decline versus the prior quarter but at billion it would still be over twice the result from q tariffs one of the key topics that ill especially be closely watching tonight is the impact of tariffs and macroeconomic uncertainty on the companys operations among the major big tech companies alphabet has shown the greatest resilience to potential geopolitical turmoil and has often demonstrated the fastest recovery following periods of uncertainty at this point they do not appear to be in significantly better shape than its peers with its stock down approximately yeartodate placing it squarely in the middle of the magnificent seven stocks i think the first step toward rebuilding investor confidence will be outlining the scope and impact of tariffs and overall geopolitical uncertainty on the companys operations as such the types of questions i expect during todays conference about how strongly tariffs will affect alphabets business it is worth noting that this isnt necessarily about the direct impact which is likely to be limited but rather the indirect effect of uncertainty on the willingness of alphabets clients to spend on advertising which constitutes a significant portion of the companys revenue price targets amid these earnings expectations analysts have been revising alphabets price targets downward over the past few weeks several top analysts have revised their month price targets for alphabet td cowen lowered its target from to ubs cut its target from to even scotiabank lowered its target from to despite that they all still rate goog stock as a buy showing they believe in its longterm value guggenheim lowered its target from to while jefferies adjusted its target from to both maintaining a buy rating piper sandler and citi followed suit reducing their targets to and respectively citing uncertainties in the advertising landscape and macroeconomic pressures i mean with all things considered the stock is down in so far combine that with rising legal risks mentioned later here and an uncertain economy and you have a good reason to reframe expectations analysts arent necessarily predicting more downside theyre just being more realistic about the upside especially in the near term if were to simplify the analysts overall message its that alphabets fundamentals are strong but the road ahead could be bumpy in the news a federal court recently ruled that google violated antitrust laws by monopolizing specific digital advertising markets the court plans to determine suitable remedies soon some analysts believe the ruling could eventually lead to the divestiture of certain google ad segments though the financial impact on alphabet is expected to be modest theres also the bigger picture between global tariffs economic uncertainty and shifts in labor and costs across the tech industry alphabet has a lot on its plate investors will want to hear how the company manages expenses hiring and regional exposure mergers and acquisitions alphabet announced a billion allcash deal to acquire cloud security platform wiz this acquisition aims to enhance google clouds security capabilities and multicloud operations analysts are projecting longterm benefits from this acquisition despite potential shortterm market pressures on other cloud service providers separately google has decided to maintain its current approach to offering thirdparty cookie choices in its chrome browser emphasizing the importance of online privacy and user control this decision is part of googles ongoing privacy sandbox initiative which aims to strengthen online privacy while supporting a sustainable addriven internet environment what now alphabets stock may be down but most analysts still believe its a longterm winner thats why buy ratings remain steady even if price targets are down q earnings could be the reset moment alphabet needs to win back momentum im thinking short term puts for earnings but holding long term shares could even sell covered calls for earnings for some extra income if you already have the shares avg price target is

1k6dp17,wallstreetbets,2025-04-23 23:29:18,checking the halving of teslas capital expenditures together found the mistake the accounting rules for the irs are different than for public financial statements of us companies oooooffff thought i got them can be locked now for full disclosure yeah i lost money on shorting this damn stock but with this in mind i got angry at the the shitshow and am now trying to understand the story of how it is possible that teslas capital expenditures halved within a year and i would like your help with this since i am not firm enough in the matter to know if im missing something i already asked a cousin of mine at the german finanzamt the equivalent of the irs to give me his take on it he has yet to answer me i particularly need your help in understanding how american capital allowances work and how long they are stretched for different items maybe im wrong and this is a nothingburger i dunno so here is the thing i got a serious problem with the way its supposed to be possible that on one hand the abschreibungen google translates this as capital allowances to me of a company that in the last five to seven years has built most of its biggest production facilities and the way these are noted in their books as i understand it most of the capital allowances for the biggest items tesla has to buy for the factories are at least here in germany written off in a time span of to years with the wide majority of items being written of after for a lot of machinery but expensive items like buildings often taking to years for the writeoff if i understand it correctly these costs appear as capital expenditures in teslas books given that tesla practically just built these factories most of the capital expenditures should still be running how is it possible that these costs simply disappear from one year to the next im willing to give you the benefit of the doubt and accept that im not qualified to make assumptions over fraud here but id really like to be presented a compelling argument on this i dont understand how this should be possible unless tesla sold off major parts of their facilities and other inventory and then leased it back or something maybe im just stupid but please explain this to me edit im not sure if i got lost in translation here but again google translated the word abschreibung to me as capital allowance so let me explain if you are a business and buy certain mostly expensive items you can not simply write the costs for that into your books rather you have to look up a long list of items and check the time the irs gives you to use these until theoretically you have to buy a new one this process is called abschreibung in german maybe there is another term for this in english would be helpful if someone translates this correctly edit so one commenter noted that the terms used in the us are depreciation amortization and impairment i think those are not the terms used by the irs and accountants but they explain why capital allowance exists since an item can still be sold for a certain value for a certain time after its bought it does not immediately constitute costs even if already paid authorities instead calculate the costs of that item by a theoretical meassure in which it depreciates in value when used for the production process which is time i guess the irs in the same way as our finanzamt has a long list of items from computers over cars to buildings that have a specific number of years to be cleared from the books as costs if a building for example has years to be cleared it means that once bought this building will show up as capital expenditure for years after so it takes years to clear these from teslas books how then can half these costs be gone within a year found the mistake the accounting rules for the irs are different than for public financial statements of us companies oooooffff thought i got them can be locked now

1k5sxqo,wallstreetbets,2025-04-23 07:03:21,the market didnt care about teslas earnings heres why tldr its not rigged everyones tripping out about why tesla is ripping after awful earnings so heres whats actually going on and what might happen tomorrow and the next few weeks tesla reported after hours margins are down revenue is weak guidance is fuzzy and elon pulled out the usual robotaxi speech tariffs are bad cheaper cars robots making cars but instead of tanking the stock jumped why short answer markets dont just trade the news they trade positioning and expectations heres how it works before earnings implied volatility iv was high that means options especially puts were expensive everyone was hedging or speculating on a big drop if you bought puts you and everyone else were betting tesla would move more than the expected range but tesla didnt crash it didnt even dip it went up so tomorrow morning we will likely see iv crush when iv drops hard after earnings thats where vega comes in vega measures how much an options price changes in relation to its implied volatility iv if youre holding puts and iv collapses those options lose value quickly even if tesla trades in your direction or sideways now lets talk about the feedback loop this is where things get interesting market makers dealers are usually on the other side of all those puts if they sell you a put theyre taking on directional risk if tesla drops they lose so to protect themselves they hedge for puts that means shorting the stock to stay neutral if the stock drops their short hedge offsets their option losses but if the stock doesnt drop or even worse it goes up they have to buy back their hedge to avoid getting wrecked that buying pushes the stock price higher and as the stock goes higher they need to buy more to stay hedged thats a gamma feedback loop add in short sellers covering their positions and a few retail traders chasing the pop and suddenly you have a rally that feeds itself even if the earnings were bad but it doesnt mean the move is real or sustainable the big dogs institutions havent even acted yet theyll dissect the call overnight and into the next day some might sell the rip some might rebalance slowly over a few days the real move sometimes doesnt hit until later lets be real this game isnt just about puts and calls market makers hedge funds and institutional players have access to insane levels of data they have entire teams of quants analysts phds and machines that track options flow gamma exposure cboe positioning bond yields fed swaps commodities fx correlations you name it they dont just trade the headlines they trade the reaction to positioning around the headlines they model the crowds behavior before the crowd even makes a move if this were as simple as bad earnings buy puts everyone would be rich but its not the options market is one of the deepest and most complex systems on the market thats why insider trading is illegal and why billionaires get into politics to legally frontrun the economy and gain access to realtime information that actually moves markets thats why your broker has analytics for gamma exposure skew delta hedging zones not because its nice to have but because its necessary if you want to survive in this ecosystem yeah some retail traders make big money sometimes but thats gambling without context youre flipping a coin this wasnt about fundamentals it was about positioning hedging mechanics and options flow the market punished the crowded trade as it always does so no the system isnt rigged its just math flow and positioning the market punishes the crowded trade too many people bet on a collapse so the opposite happened welcome to the dealers game

1k5b0z2,wallstreetbets,2025-04-22 16:44:00,everything about teslas earnings tonight tesla is releasing their earnings tonight and because they tend to move quite a bit with earnings i wanted to see if we could try to bet on it either calls or puts tesla generally moves and shot up last two earnings but down badly the one prior in july for tonights firstquarter earnings and revenue from what ive read it looks like a lot of analysts are already predicting poor results they see see eps down to cents a share though more recent forecasts point to a further slide revenue should fall a fraction to billion with the sharp consensus pointing to a decline to billion tesla q consensus earnings projections have come down more than since the end of the q eps target was just before teslas q earnings release whats interesting is that in q teslas net income was boosted by a recent change in how companies account for holdings of digital currencies this policy change resulted in an earnings per share addon of cents in q with a net income increase of million so the price of corn could actually really influence the results today the company delivered evs in q down vs a year earlier and the lowest since q they fell vs qs record evs the bright spot is tesla china where sales appeared to edge higher vs a year earlier but those tend to be lower margin us and european sales have tumbled on musks brand woes tesla also deployed gigawatthours of energy storage products in q down slightly vs qs record gwh but up vs a year earlier ive looked at a few articles regarding evs it looks like auto gross margins excluding regulatory tax credits of compared to a year ago the average selling price per vehicle coming in at in q down from in q so this is what im expecting for today as usual the focus will be on elon and the earnings call tesla is also changing things up and have said in addition to posting first quarter results it will hold a live company update and question and answer session what this means is anybodys best guess he in the past has repeatedly said earnings calls are not for product announcements could this mean hell give significant details on the new affordable vehicle or could it be similar to the recent allhands company meeting where he told employees to hold onto their tesla stock touting the future of artificial intelligence and robotics in any case im moreso interested to see if he sticks to his forecast for unsupervised selfdriving ride hailing in austin this june any details about the affordable vehicle if he sees delivery growth in after a weak q and sluggish start to april and what are his plans around his work with the trump white house honestly all this trump stuff has seemingly hurt sales and dropped the stock but there isnt really much we can know about the precise impact on teslas bottom line until tonight its already been reported that tesla will delay its upcoming affordable ev by at least three months tesla had said it planned production of a lowercost vehicle by midyear but various reports had suggested it would come in late or the latest report said production will start in the us followed by china and europe they have not given any details about the ev but multiple reports have said itll be a strippeddown model y rather than a new form factor like a hatchback i honestly think he needs to leave government and be a fulltime ceo for tesla right now his temporary status as a government employee expires next month so he will face questions about his plans during the call he really needs to lay out the timelinehard facts around the rollout of autonomous vehicles and robotics over the next months i want answers on when the new lower cost vehicle will hit the production line honestly if he chooses to stay with the government it could change the future of teslabrand damage will grow not good in addition to this rival automakers saw huge sales gains as consumers pushed up purchases to avoid tariffs which began on april teslas main rival overseas byd has been eating into teslas market share for some time now so with this im considering puts or a put spread considering the stock is up puts are at a discount now since the stock usually goes up or down i would target the or strike price with exp date we also have google earnings on thursday so im going to be looking at that as well

1k4ooy7,wallstreetbets,2025-04-21 21:07:24,stephen mirans idea about tariffs is not black and white as he saysmy thoughts ive read the paper times to really get his points across i think the paper is a must read not because there is a lot to learn from it but because you should be prepared what the admin thinks so get prepared i want to discuss one idea from the paper even though many topics are worth discussing he says tariffs are usually paid by the exporting nation companies in that nation only if currency is offset by the same percentage as the tariff example imported good price is pre trariff dollar value is up so that same good now costs tariff added of for that good now makes it we call it same price basically so his point is that tariffs can be offset this way so consumer pays basically the same price but goes to the treasury thus exporting nation company basically paid the tariff and us gets additional revenue i think this is kind of misleading for the reason mathematically what he says is true but burden is still shared by the consumer and the exporting nation in this case not only by exporting nation consumer is still robbed of the opportunity to buy the good for and capitalize from dollar valuation instead he pays same price and not getting any benefit from it i understand that possibly this revenue from tariffs will bring some of the taxes down yet to see but not to the point that you would be compensated and still pay for the same product he often gives the same example in interviews there are couple of them where he compares a house sale if for example tax of real estate is up by the seller also ups the value for but buyer does not want to buy the seller has to sell the house for the original price thus he burdens the cost of the tax because of inelasticity i think this example is comparing apples to oranges because buyer does not share burden in this case so he makes a trick that it is the same with tariffs when in reality consumer is still robbed of opportunity in the first case and not in this case now the next point he makes is that inelasticity makes exporting nation pay the tariff because they dont have anywhere else to sell the product even after exporting company squeeze maximum margin just to stay in the market part of the cost is still shared with the consumer because consumer would never fully capitalize from squeezing margins even if price is now lower than it previously was final thought i think it is in the spectrum of who burdens the cost by how much all thoughts are welcomed maybe im wrong maybe im right want to hear what you think of this

1k4i5n9,wallstreetbets,2025-04-21 16:47:51,dd how to profit off the tradewar ii invested hi all a couple of weeks back i posted a dd where i explained my trading strategy as tensions over trade between the united states and china continued to increase we are now at an inflection point and i expect that several events over the next few weeks will send stocks in my preferred sector soaring in this post ill explain what these events are and i will provide an update on my portfolio as far as this sector is concerned my thesis again remains the same as it always was thesis the mining industry presents a massive opportunity anywhere from right now to the end of the present us administration and hopefully beyond the investments that will matter most have to do with the processing extraction separation and manufacturing of titanium lithium and rare earth minerals deemed critical these investments must be allied with western interests ideally operating in the united states the issue that is most relevant is the complete market dominance china has over these metals and rare earth minerals mp materials ceases shipments to china and why this is great news the only vertically integrated operational rare earth mining and processing company in the united states is mp materials in previous posts i canvassed a number of reasons to be bullish about this company beyond the fact that they have the domestic side of the market locked down these reasons included substantial stakes taken recently by institutional investors as well as a number of executive actions and legislation this past thursday mp materials released a press statement noting that they have ceased shipments to china this is significant given their previous export history with china and relatedly their dependence on chinese processing to refine their materials they write in response to chinas retaliatory tariffs and export controls mp materials nyse mp has ceased shipments of rare earth concentrate to china selling our valuable critical materials under tariffs is neither commercially rational nor aligned with americas national interest we have been preparing for this moment since day one our mission capital strategy and execution reflect a longterm vision built to withstand shortterm dislocation and emerge stronger i believe in agreement that any downward pressure on mp will be shortlived although i am sure it will be volatile this week today very much so the strategic timing of this press release however signals to me that they have already secured assurances from the present administration that they will support the company through purchasing agreements similar to those that will come from the planned executive order on stockpiling deep sea minerals moreover ceasing shipments to china signals that mp materials has a margin of comfort with their capacity and ability to refine their own materials such that they no longer feel bound to depend on china to process any of their materials whatsoever indeed they write mp has invested nearly billion to restore the full rare earth supply chain in the united states today our california refinery is processing nearly half of our production with virtually all of that material sold into markets outside chinaincluding japan south korea and the united states ii critical minerals import controls as if the above were not enough the present administration recently issued an order to investigate critical minerals import controls a la section the factsheet notes this order directs the secretary of commerce to initiate a section investigation under the trade expansion act of to evaluate the impact of imports of these materials on americas security and resilience this investigation will assess vulnerabilities in supply chains the economic impact of foreign market distortions and potential trade remedies to ensure a secure and sustainable domestic supply of these essential materialsthe investigation will culminate in a report detailing risks and providing recommendations to strengthen domestic production reduce dependence on foreign suppliers and enhance economic and national security following this report the administration may well decide to impose tariffs on critical minerals taking the place of any current reciprocal tariffs pursuant to the april order tariff i recommend that each of you interested in this sector read the fact sheet in its entirety it does a fantastic job explaining just how critical this investigation is and provides an overview of the issues plaguing the domestic side of the industry including price manipulation by china iii ukraine minerals deal as if the two points above were not enough the present administration also signaled today that ukraine plans to negotiate and sign a minerals deal within the next few weeks theyve already signed an agreement by way of a memorandum treasury secretary scott bessent predicts that the deal would be signed around april its substantially what we agreed on previously when the president was here bessant said we had a memorandum of understanding we went straight to the big deal and an page agreement and thats what well be signing the question of what this agreement will look like in its final form is unknown however i would not be surprised if the raw materials obtained in ukraine would be shipped to the usa for refining if that were so mp materials would stand to benefit tremendously iv portfolio update before signing off i wanted to also provide an update on the holdings in my portfolio i hold a mixture of calls and shares in these positions a number have already begun to return sizable gains see for example recent profits from mp here enjoy the opening bell everyone

1k3o8au,wallstreetbets,2025-04-20 14:50:26,asts dd the space trade will cum when i first wrote about asts years ago it was the first dd on the stock to appear on this subreddit i told you to dismantle your grandparents porch to sell the top of lumber and buy the stock i was kinda right but also terribly wrong as you can see in my gain post here now i am older wiser richer and with a hotter wife and better dd so settle in and learn something or dont its whatever when you last ignored me there was one key point in the asts investment thesis asts wholesale model gives them access to billions of customers and thereby revenue all satellite companies save for spacexs starlink have failed because they cannot effectively monetize their service technology isnt a problem its the gotomarket strategy which fails asts has solved this with its wholesale model working with existing telecoms under the fccs rules for supplemental coverage from space iridium was one of the most incredible engineering accomplishments in history everyone who used it loved it it was the only way calls could be made in nyc on the only way to call out of new orleans in hurricane katrina its the first thing every person at the top of everest reaches for the list goes on the problem is that iridium couldnt sell the service it was expensive for the specialized headset and by the minute in its use people didnt know it existed iridium were engineers not marketers a market didnt exist maritime and remote villages and niche minute by minute sales does not a market make asts solves this with its super wholesale model where att verizon rakuten vodaphone and others do all the marketing all the sales all the billing and upsell their existing customer base for a service they want anyway more on this later asts does not need to find customers their agreements with the above give them instant access to b paying handsets overnight asts does not need to sell the world a new device every cell phone just works that is the entire story that valued asts to its core investors since it started trading as a spac while every single asts long term investor lost the love of their wives as the stock cratered to the story changed five additional pillars have been layered on top of the above original thesis which makes me and you if you are capable of reading more bullish they are as follows military applications noncommunications use the large array and patented technology have more uses than just communications with cell phones they can be used as an alternative to gps for missile tracking for pnt and more any piece of military equipment that can accept a small wireless chip can use asts the future of war is remote drone operations they need connection asts does that too asts was awarded through a prime contractor a united states space development agency sda contract worth million this is for satellites for one year and paid out linearly fairwinds advertisement for the service shows asts communicating with existing military satellites this award will likely be expanded as more satellites come into service hybrid acquisition for proliferated lowearth orbit halo program asts was awarded a starter contract as their own prime the program can cover launch and parts costs on top of service payments end game of this is asts use for missile tracking in the golden dome the trump administration wants to build out european monopoly satco joint venture with vodaphone asts and vodaphone created a joint venture for all of europe where they will sell the service to other european telcos they will also be offering the service to the european government much like the company is currently doing in the us importantly all the data will be sent and received entirely in the eu all infrastructure will live in the eu it will be an entirely european company to be more marketable in europe all of this has happened as elon is nuking his rep in europe with roman salutes and threating to withhold ukraines access to starlink people are realizing that elon is not dependable and they need alternatives asts is that alternative the company has begun to acquire ligado spectrum to create their own data service which does not rely on the leasing of spectrum from att and verizon this ligado spectrum has been unusable in the past due to interference with gps and military spectrum in nearby bands ligado was using this satellite spectrum as terrestrial with fcc waivers unsuccessfully asts brings value to this spectrum through its beam forming which results in no interference spectrum can be valued on a per mhz per population basis at mhzpop mhz m people in the united states we can value this spectrum at billion dollars this is the entire market cap of asts as it stands today the company is acquiring the exclusive use of this spectrum for far below this cost m m penny warrants m year small revenue share the value of spectrum based on previous auctions likely discounts the future value of spectrum based on the number of connected devices we will be seeing in the future there is more upside than the b figure represents see point bi asts does its own design and manufacturing and is already designing a new satellite to work with its ligado spectrum this deal closing will allow asts to sell capacity to its partners or offer their own service ala starlink ai requires constant connectivity facebook is spending b to put fiber underwater for bigger pipes for their own data thats all that you need to know about where the biggest companies believe data is going with the introduction of ai asts solves this and blankets the entire earth with data connectivity albeit with less speed however building this giant globe spanning fiber still does not solve the issue of connectivity in the outer reaches of the planet this is just for the easily accessible areas meaning asts still provides value in data delivery which may be of use to companies like facebook autonomous ai agents need connection and backup connections to operate data delivery in all corners of the world matters to make use of ai think of every time you have paid for internet on a plane you need it access to data too even if you think ai doesnt it does consider the number of connected things you have now airtags smart watches phones laptops cars trucks fucking killer drones from palmer lucky farm equipment doorbells your wifes wifi dildo that actually makes her cum unlike you your wifi buttplug etc all of this adds value to the ability to reliably deliver internet to all corners of the planet that is asts market space is strategic when i first wrote about the company i thought elon and bezos were just playing with the new billionaires toy of rockets it turns out they were just one step ahead of the game space is strategic and having access to your own internet is incredibly valuable given the need for constant connection with ai they know this and are leveraging their launch capacity to build out their own private internet asts benefits from an increase in launch capacity by having these billionaires fight for asts billions of dollars in launch costs asts can essentially play king maker every dollar which goes to blue origin isnt going to spacex and vice versa asts future launch cadence with its launches represents billions in launch costs they can make the below fight for the lowest cost to get this future business note asts already has agreements for launches into the end of at satellites the company expects to be at cash flow breakeven dont bet against the below the space trade will come elon musk starlink spacex jeff bezos blue origin new glenn kupier eric schmidt relativity peter beck rocket lab abel avellan asts before one of you morons say waaaaaa but what about starlink shut the fuck up and get out of my dd thanks starlink proper does not speak to cell phones which is why they require end users to have a dish or a mini dish to use their service their direct to cell solution with tmobile is not purpose built and has failed to deliver simple text messages take some time to read reviews of their service it is complete shit and has no hopes of delivering broadband speed like asts without a complete redesign which is probably difficult given that their lead engineer for dc just left the company not a great look innit alright with that out of the way we can continue the rest of this writeup i completed for school and is a technical writeup of the company enjoy or whatever there is very little information about the business valuation because i am not smart like that or in any other way but neither are you if you want to know more read uthekookreport s dd document it is incredible and if you take the time to read it you might have the conviction required to acquire generational wealth good luck anyways here ya go bud company and industry background ast spacemobile asts is pioneering directtodevice satellite connectivity enabling standard unmodified smartphones to connect directly to satellites for broadband cellular service this groundbreaking technology positions asts uniquely to deliver global mobile broadband coverage especially in areas lacking traditional terrestrial infrastructure through large powerful phasedarray antennas deployed on satellites in low earth orbit asts creates cell towers in space which provide seamless connectivity without the need for specialized satellite phones or additional equipment like satellite dishes globally approximately billion people lack internet access world economic forum primarily due to economic barriers in deploying terrestrial networks in remote or sparsely populated regions asts addresses this significant digital divide by allowing these individuals to access broadband services using any existing smartphone according to groupe speciale mobile association gsma as of december approximately billion mobile subscribers are constantly moving in and out of coverage approximately billion people have no cellular broadband coverage and approximately million people have no connectivity or mobile cellular coverage there are approximately billion smartphones in the world all of which would be compatible with asts service on day without any modifications required as their service purely mimics existing gsma service as global connectivity becomes increasingly essential particularly with the rapid expansion and integration of artificial intelligence the value of asts grows exponentially asts strategically targets underserved regions in both developed and developing markets focusing on areas where conventional terrestrial infrastructure is economically impractical or geographically challenging the companys approach aligns with the fccs supplemental coverage from space scs framework fcca which outlines the means of providing cell phone coverage from space and necessitates spectrum leasing agreements with established mobile network operators mnos recognizing this requirement asts has secured strategic investments from industry leaders such as google att verizon american tower and vodafone these investments validate astss technological and business approach simultaneously offering traditional mnos a beneficial partnership operators like att and verizon benefit by monetizing their spectrum in otherwise unused regions this also benefits mnos and american tower by effectively hedging their terrestrial tower businesses against the propagation of spacebased service and maximizing existing assets and valuable spectrum unlike conventional satellite phone providers or systems such as starlink and project kuiper which compensate for smaller satellite footprints by relying heavily on extensive ground infrastructure astss design is distinct it employs significantly larger satellite antenna arrays enabling direct communication with regular mobile phones without modifications the large antennas generate a robust loud signal from space capable of directly reaching unmodified consumer devicescontrasting sharply with traditional satellite phones which rely on devices actively searching for faint satellite signals additionally astss larger arrays dramatically reduce the total number of satellites needed for global coverage for instance while project kuiper plans to deploy satellites and starlink already operates over satellites asts aims to achieve global coverage with approximately satellites this not only optimizes efficiency but also addresses growing concerns about orbital congestion and space debris the wholesale gotomarket strategy adopted by asts leverages existing customer bases from mobile network operators providing a significant competitive advantage unlike previous satellite endeavors such as iridiumwhich faced challenges not with technology but with market adoption due to high costs and complex marketingasts offers a straightforward accessible solution that integrates seamlessly with existing mobile ecosystems the model ensures rapid adoption and scalability delivering reliable broadband service globally without the barriers encountered by traditional satellite communication providers to further enhance customer accessibility and peace of mind asts offers flexible pricing options such as day passes and affordable monthly fees ensuring users remain consistently connected wherever they travel this model caters to the growing expectation of constant connectivity as increasingly more devicesincluding cars smartwatches location trackers and other iot gadgetsrely on continuous internet access consumers regularly demonstrate willingness to pay for reliable connectivity just think of every time you have paid or considered paying for inflight wifi in fact early findings show nearly twothirds of subscribers are willing to pay extra for satellite connectivity with about half open to month for offgrid connectivity sources of innovation when a cell phone initiates a call or sends data the signal travels through an uplink from the device to the nearest cell tower at the towers base station this signal is processed and forwarded through a highcapacity connection known as backhaul typically via fiberoptic cables or microwave links toward the network core the network core functions like the networks brain determining the signals destination and routing it accordingly from the network core the call or data is directed out through the appropriate aggregation points and backhaul connections toward the recipients nearest tower at this final cell tower the signal is sent via a downlink directly to the receiving users phone completing the communication in contrast asts approach replaces traditional cell towers and terrestrial backhaul infrastructure with satellites positioned in low earth orbit when a phone communicates with asts bluebird satellite the uplink signal travels directly from the users phone to the satellite itself acting as a tower in space the satellite processes and beams the signal back down to strategically located ground gateways that connect to the terrestrial network core bypassing the extensive network of ground towers and traditional backhaul the core network then routes the call or data to the recipient either via terrestrial towers or via another satellite beam this approach effectively removes geographic barriers delivering cellular connectivity even in remote or underserved areas where traditional terrestrial infrastructure is unavailable or economically impractical starlink has recently gained significant attention with its highprofile super bowl advertisement showcasing their satellite texting offering with tmobile bringing public awareness to directtodevice dd connectivity mobile world live however despite this increased visibility starlink faces inherent technological limitations in its beamforming capabilities the satellites antennas generate broad flashlightlike beams that cover large geographical areas but lack precision this approach leads to increased interference with neighboring networks and limits starlinks ability to efficiently reuse spectrum ultimately restricting network capacity and data throughput for individual users starlinks beam design contrasts sharply with more advanced dd satellite systems that utilize precise narrowlyfocused beams to minimize interference and maximize spectrum efficiency due to starlinks broader beam coverage each satellite can serve fewer distinct user groups simultaneously which reduces overall service quality and speed per user as a result while starlinks highprofile marketing has drawn consumer attention to satellitebased mobile connectivity its practical applications remain constrained particularly in densely populated or interferencesensitive areas where efficient beam management and high throughput are critical comparatively asts employs significantly narrower laserfocused beams enabled by their large phasedarray antennas as detailed in fcc filings fcc asts satellites can generate beams as narrow as less than one degree precisely targeting coverage areas and significantly reducing interference in contrast starlinks fcc filings fcc indicate beam widths that can span tens or hundreds of kilometers with antenna gains around dbi resulting in broader coverage but increased interference and reduced spectral efficiency astss advanced beamforming capabilities allow for precise efficient frequency reuse and higher overall throughput per user providing a notable advantage over starlink in both performance and spectrum management the top image taken from fcc filings represents the antenna pattern for asts system akin to a laser pointer with a very sharp narrow central beam and significantly lower sidelobes this tight focus ensures the energy is highly concentrated minimizing interference with other areas and maximizing the signal strength in the intended coverage zone conversely the bottom image illustrates starlinks broader beam pattern similar to a flashlight with a wide central lobe and substantial sidelobes the broader distribution of energy leads to greater interference and less precise coverage reducing overall network efficiency and limiting the achievable throughput per user asts innovation is best shown in their extensive patent portfolio some of which protect this signal creation asts utilizes significantly larger satellites featuring advanced phasedarray antennas that unfold in orbit allowing them to generate stronger and more precise signals directly to standard mobile phones the satellite itself employs a straightforward bent pipe design which simply receives signals from phones and redirects them toward ground gateways without complex onboard processing the sophisticated management of signals is handled by astss proprietary software on the ground ensuring seamless integration with existing mobile carrier networks and compatibility with current and future mobile technologies including g we can examine some key patents from the company to gain a better understanding of their technology advantage mechanical deployable structure for leo this patent covers asts deployment mechanism for its large flat satellites the satellites antenna array is made of many squarerectangular panels with solar on one side and antennas on the other hinged together with springloaded connectors these storedenergy hinges often called spring tapes automatically unfold the panels into a contiguous flat array once the satellite is in space without needing motors or power to do the deployment in essence the satellite launches compactly folded up and when it reaches orbit it pops open on its own like a springloaded blanket this is a core enabler for asts business it allows them to fit a very large antenna into a small launch volume and reliably deploy it in orbit the selfdeploying design reduces complexity and points of failure since fewer motors or controls are needed lowering launch and manufacturing costs successfully deploying a massive antenna is critical for asts service capability integrated antenna module with thermal management this patent describes the flat antenna module that integrates solar cells and radio antennas into one structure and includes builtin cooling features in simple terms each panel on asts satellite serves as both a power source via solar cells and a communication antenna while also dissipating its own heat this means the satellite can be made up of many such panels tiled into the huge antenna array above without overheating this innovation allows asts to deploy very large powerefficient antennas in orbit enabling stronger signals and broad coverage for mobile users without the weight or complexity of separate cooling systems dynamic time division duplex dtdd for satellite networks this patent introduces a smart timing controller that manages uplink and downlink signals so they dont collide when using timedivision duplex tdd over satellite in laymans terms because satellites are far away signals take longer to travel this system dynamically adjusts when a phone should send vs receive so that echoes of a transmission dont interfere with new data for asts this technology is crucial it lets standard mobile phones communicate seamlessly with satellites by finetuning timing which improves network reliability and throughput without this patent the time between uplink and downlink would result in loss of signal as normal cell signals are not used to the latency experienced in space travel geolocation of devices using spaceborne phased arrays this patent outlines a method for pinpointing a phones location from space using the satellites phasedarray antenna the satellite first uses its multiple beams to get a rough location which cell or area the device is in then refines the devices position by analyzing doppler shifts and signal travel time the satellite can not only talk to your phone but also figure out where you are by how your signal frequency changes due to motion and delays similar to how gps works but using the communication signal itself direct gsm communication via satellite this patent covers a solution that allows standard gsm mobile phones g phones to connect directly to a satellite the system involves a satellite with a coverage area divided into cells and a ground infrastructure that includes a feeder link and tracking antenna to manage the connection a primary processing device communicates with the active users phones and a secondary processor adjusts timing delays for all the beamscells this tricks the gsm phones into thinking the satellite is just another cell tower by handling the long signal delay network access management for satellite ran this patent describes a method to efficiently handle when a user device first tries to connect to a satellitebased radio network the idea is to use a single wide beam from the satellite to watch for any phone requesting access across a large area of many cells once a phones request is detected in a particular cell the system then lights up that cell with a focused beam and can broadcast necessary signals to other inactive cells as needed essentially the satellite first yells anyone out there over a broad area and when a phone waves back the satellite switches to a more targeted conversation with that phones sector this ondemand beam switching is businesscritical for asts it conserves power and spectrum by not constantly servicing empty regions allowing one satellite to cover many cells efficiently it means the network can support more users over a wide area with fewer satellites lowering operational costs and improving user experience by quickly granting access when someone pops up in a normally quiet zone satellite mimo communication system this patent describes a technique for using multiple antennas on both the satellite or satellites and the user side to create a mimo multipleinput multipleoutput link for data in simple terms the base station on the ground can send out multiple distinct radio streams through different satellite beams or even different satellites to a device that has several antennas by doing so the end user if capable like modern phones with multiple antennas can receive parallel data streams boosting throughput seamless beam handover between satellites this patent deals with handing off a users connection from one lowearthorbit satellite to the next to avoid dropped calls or data sessions it outlines a system where an area on earth cell that is covered by a setting satellite one moving out of view is also in view of a rising satellite the network uses overlapping beams one satellites beam and then the others beam cover the same cell during handover a processing device orchestrates two communication links and switches the users session from the first satellite to the second as the first goes over the horizon typespatterns of innovation initial testing ast began its journey in with modest yet creative experiment their first satellite bluewalker bw placed the components of an everyday cell phone into space as a nanosatellite developed in collaboration with nanoavionics instead of the conventional and costly approachlaunching a satellite to communicate with groundbased phones ast reversed this arrangement they connected a cell phone in orbit with a specialized groundbased satellite bluewalker this unusual yet insightful solution significantly reduced the initial costs of launch deployment enabling rapid and costeffective rd this approach was innovative both economically and operationally demonstrating practical realworld viability of their core concept funding and expansion early on the company attracted strategic backing from the telecom industry in a series b round of million was led by vodafone and japans rakuten with participation from samsung and american tower signaling broad industry confidence in asts directtophone satellite technology importantly during this time these investors did their own due diligence on the business and verified the work up to this point and the business case rather than a traditional ipo asts utilized a spac merger to go public in april it merged with new providence acquisition corp raising a total of million in gross proceeds including million from a pipe investment by vodafone rakuten and american tower bluewalker satellite with spac funding secured asts increased their rd spend to launch a fully functional satellite bluewalker bw featuring the largest phasedarray antenna ever deployed in space save for the international space station the satellite was approximately sq ft roughly the size of a onebedroom apartment bw employed field programmable gate arrays fpga enabling inorbit software upgrades and flexible testing to allow changes not captured with bw to be complete after launch successful demonstrations of bws capability included groundbreaking tests such as the firstever g video call from space to an everyday smartphone in hawaii validating their ability to deliver advanced broadband connectivity directly from orbit bluebird block in september ast took critical steps toward commercialization with the launch of their first commercial satellites bluebirds through spacecom these satellites further tested vital functionalities including seamless handoffs between satellites a key requirement for global continuous connectivity these launches were strategically significant marking the transition from proofofconcept to scalable commercial operations demonstration video calls were conducted and announced through mno partners vodafone att and verizon for testing asts technology in realworld networks these tests were the result of the fcc granting a special temporary authority sta to the company this was particularly significant given its alignment with the broader regulatory landscape under the new fcc commissioner brendan carr trump appointed which shows the regulatory and market acceptance of asts innovative business model further this removed the elon musk sized elephant in the room wherein starlink was thought to be the only satellite gaining the approval under the new administration nextgeneration asics ast is also innovating on hardware performance through development of nextgeneration applicationspecific integrated circuits asics replacing initial fpga implementations these asic chips promise a x increase in data throughput as in total data deliverable this dramatic efficiency improvement increases future satellite capabilities and economic performance making their network even more attractive for commercial deployment nextgeneration satellites asts innovation continues with bluebird bb a significantly scaledup satellite design of sq ft incorporating nextgen asic technology these satellites represent a major leap forward in performance and capability scheduled to be launched through agreements with blue origin isro and spacex through increased size and performance from the asic asts intends to increase the mbps download speed represented by block to mbps in future iterations of their technology by the end of ast aims to have a constellation of approximately satellites in orbit bolstered by substantial financial backing with over billion in available capital strategic spectrum acquisition see above ligado at character limit military and government partnerships recognizing strategic opportunities ast has advanced their military use cases positioning its technology as a solution for the us department of defense and space development agency sda with their satellite constellation able to integrate seamlessly with existing military satellite communication milsatcom infrastructure ast becomes highly relevant for sensitive government applications such as missile tracking asset monitoring and secure communications a recent million sda contract further highlights asts alignment with national security interests and confirms their technologys strategic importance as part of the us space force sda will accelerate delivery of needed spacebased capabilities to the joint warfighter to support terrestrial missions through development fielding and operation of the proliferated warfighter space architecture definition of valueadded for the firms productsservices resilience in disaster response one of the most compelling advantages of a spacebased cellular network is its resilience during disasters when hurricanes wildfires earthquakes or other natural disasters strike terrestrial infrastructure often fails cell towers can be knocked out by storms or burned in wildfires leaving first responders and affected communities without communication exactly when its most needed asts satellite technology adds a crucial layer of redundancy even if ground towers are down the network in the sky and a single base station anywhere in the country remains operational this capability can be lifesaving in emergency scenarios asts has been working closely with att to integrate its system with firstnet the dedicated us public safety network for first responders firstnet built by att provides priority cellular service to police firefighters emts and other emergency personnel by extending firstnet into space asts ensures that first responders stay connected in real time anywhere the value added by asts in disaster response is clear persistent coverage when conventional networks fail cost efficiency compared to subsea cables building out global internet connectivity has traditionally meant expensive infrastructure projects such as undersea fiberoptic cables to connect continents these projects involve enormous capital expenditures and long deployment timelines asts approach launching a constellation of low earth orbit satellites presents a potentially more flexible and costefficient path to worldwide broadband coverage a rough cost comparison highlights this difference in strategy and scalability asts plans to deploy a complete constellation of satellites to achieve global coverage each satellite in asts bluebird series is estimated to cost on the order of million to build and launch brian graft analyst deutsche bank anything on the cost per satellite has that changed at all are you still in that to range abel avellan no yes were not changing the guidance on cost per satellite its important to note that satellite broadband isnt a wholesale replacement for fiber in terms of raw capacity major cables can carry tremendous data volume at very low latency along their fixed routes which is vital for the core internet backbone however from a business strategy perspective asts satellites offer a more economical way to extend the last mile of connectivity to users who would otherwise require huge investment to reach enabling alwayson connectivity for emerging technologies beyond simply connecting people asts continuous global coverage unlocks critical opportunities for emerging technologies that depend on uninterrupted internet access for ai agents and cloud services constant connectivity is essential autonomous robotics including selfdriving cars drones and agricultural robots similarly benefit from asts satellite service ensuring seamless operation even in remote areas beyond traditional cellular coverage strategic independence and the european dd initiative see above satco jv with vodaphone need to cut word count wholesale model nomadbets twitter shows the breakdown of subscriber potential with asts this is where revenue will blow out all expectations asts competencies are built around its ability to design manufacture and deploy large and powerful satellites optimized for directtodevice dd connectivity all of which are critical for maximizing signal strength bandwidth and data throughput directly to everyday smartphones asts expertise in large arrays is particularly advantageous as bigger and thereby heavier arrays translate directly into stronger signals increased power generation and significantly improved data speeds to user devices asts requires just large satellites for global coverage compared to for amazons kuiper and over for spacexs starlink this greatly reduces capex collision risk launch risk and replacement costs for ast with all this in mind ast benefits greatly from falling launch costs enabled by leading spacelaunch providers such as blue origin and spacex this is best displayed as a yearoveryear pricing trend of launch vehicles on a perkilogram basis as launch providers increasingly offer highercapacity rockets at reduced costs asts uniquely benefits from its strategy of deploying fewer heavier satellites with large highperformance antennas rather than numerous smaller satellites the first successful flight of blue origins new glenn rocket notably demonstrated its capability to carry up to eight of asts block satellites simultaneously providing a clear cost advantage likewise spacexs falcon recognized globally for its reliability and affordability can accommodate four block satellites per launch additionally the progress on spacexs starship program offers further promise potentially unlocking even greater launch capacities at lower costs asts operational competencies are further strengthened by its vertical integration approximately vertically integrated for manufacturing of satellite components and subsystems for which we own or license the ip and control the manufacturing process by controlling its own production processes and intellectual property ast not only reduces dependency on external suppliersmitigating geopolitical and supplychain risksbut also achieves superior cost efficiencies and quality control this vertical integration is crucial at a time when the united states is prioritizing domestic capability in strategic industries like space technology positioning ast favorably to benefit from increasing governmental support and protective policies the companys production strategy is robust and ambitious with ast targeting a monthly production rate of six satellites at its texas factory this consistent cadence enables rapid scaling and timely replacement of satellites ensuring continuous reliable service for customers given rising geopolitical tensions particularly concerning competition with china in space exploration and technology asts fully integrated usbased manufacturing operation places it strategically to capitalize on potential government partnerships or contracts aimed at strengthening domestic space capabilities organizational structurecultureleadership this

1k1dbj3,wallstreetbets,2025-04-17 13:52:05,forecasting teslas earnings qa tuesday evening tesla will release its q earnings professional analysts have put in a lot of work to try to predict how the numbers will come out and if youre interested in that sort of thing you can find it easily on google instead im going to try to forecast how tesla management will handle the qa portion of the event some of the questions will come live from professional analystsbut tesla has also indicated they will respond to questions from retail investors submitted and voted on via the say app so im going to look at the current topvoted six questions tesla may not address every single one of them but i expect them to try to answer most of them tldr its clear even relatively bullish tesla investors have serious concerns about the company and tesla management is going to have a difficult time reassuring them during the earnings call anyway here are the questions when will fsd unsupervised be available for personal use on personallyowned cars this is current topvoted question on say which is a little surprising because i think its a pretty safe bet that teslas management will decline to make any predictions perhaps elon musk will blame peoples alleged irrational fear of selfdriving cars as he did in teslas previous earnings call where he complained that if somebody scrapes that shin with an autonomous car its headline news theres another reason for tesla to refuse to make promises though theres simply no evidence teslas selfdriving tech has caught up to where waymo was several years ago more on that below is tesla still on track for releasing more affordable models this year or will you be focusing on simplified versions to enhance affordability similar to the rwd cybertruck here again i think we can predict fairly confidently what tesla will say theyre going with somewhat cheaper variants of existing models the new cybertruck is only about but i understand why tesla investors want this question answeredduring teslas earnings call for q it was hinted that the company would be introducing a much less expensive model to compete with budget ev models offered by companies like nissan and kia the prospect was greeted with enthusiasm by investors now however those investors are going to want to see tesla deliver unfortunately if the plan for a new cheaper tesla model were ever on track theyve probably have been completely derailed by trumps tariffs in fact just yesterday reuters released a story about just how big of a problem the new tariffs are for tesla some may see a silver lining in that tariffs should also make nissans and kias much more expensive but im not sure tesla will even try to make that argument musk himself has said tariffs will have a significant impact on tesla and i think he means it how is tesla positioning itself to flexibly adapt to global economic risks in the form of tariffs political biases etc this question gets to tariffs directly tesla management will no doubt try to offer some hopeperhaps pointing out that the situation is still up in the air to a significant extentbut its going to be hard to sugarcoat the situation im not exactly sure what the questioner means by political biases but stick a pin in it because its not the only highlyvoted question that mentions politics does tesla still have a battery supply constraint noted on q er call and how does this change wtariffs this references a comment musk made in the previous earnings call about battery production rather than demand being the biggest constraint on tesla sales it seems quite likely this is no longer truebecause demand is down that said the reporting ive read on how tariffs will affect tesla hasnt mentioned battery production specifically as an area where tariffs will really hurt did tesla experience any meaningful changes in order inflow rate in q relating to all of the rumors of brand damage it is extremely weird that this question is framed in terms of rumors because to be clear this is what we are talking about processing img hmigczcybve the above scene is currently playing out somewhere on the order of a hundred two hundred times per week across the country in terms of what would be good for teslas stock price wednesday morning after earnings probably the best possible thing that could happen is that musk uses the earnings call to announce that hes stepping down from the trump administration and devoting his full attention to tesla personally im not sure this would actually solve teslas problems but i think lots of investors think it would however it seems unlikely musk will step down from his role in the trump administration in the foreseeable future two weeks ago when politico reported musk was leaving the trump administration both musk and the white house quickly denounced the story as fake news furthermore musks x feed is still in full maga mode giving absolutely no indication he regrets anything about his political activities the bestcase scenario here again from a tesla shareholder point of view is probably that we get some spin about how given x y and z teslas q delivery numbers are actually better than people realize a claim of that sort will probably be met with skepticism from many investors but it beats musk going on a rant how hes the target of a vast criminal conspiracy funded by george soros the latter possibility is not one id necessarily bet much money on but its also hard not to wonder about given the current state of musks x account and last but certainly not least robotaxi still on track for this year for context in his opening remarks for teslas most recent earnings call musk said we feel confident in being able to do an initial launch of unsupervised no one in the car full selfdriving in austin in june then during the qa section the very first question submitted via the say app specifically asked about unsupervised fsd in california to which musk replied im confident that well release unsupervised fsd california this year as well finally when an analyst asked about how the company will know whether or not its on the right track in months musk went even further im very confident well have released unsupervised full selfdriving fully autonomous teslas in austin and several other cities in america by the end of this year as probably everywhere in america next year at everywhere in north america at least i think in terms of next year our constraints i think its likely to be just regulatory i expect musk to have to walk this rhetoric back next week maybe only slightlymaybe this year becomes by end of year or early next year but it still wont exactly be the news investors are hoping to hear the trouble here is that theres simply no evidence tesla has figured out how to make selfdriving cars that can operate safely without human supervision its possible tesla really will try to take advantage of a lax friendly regulatory environment in texas to launch a taxi service in austin fairly soonbut even then it seems likely these taxis will be teleoperated not unsupervised musks equivocation between unsupervised and no one in the car has been noted by tesla watchers worse theres no indication tesla has made any progress on launching robotaxis outside texasmisleading hype about getting a chauffeur license in california notwithstanding in short a lot of investors are going to be going into this earnings call looking for reassurance from tesla and i just dont think the company can give it to them processing img nnpsmticve

1jzwbwm,wallstreetbets,2025-04-15 16:31:19,so the yield curve has been normalized for a while now heres my bearish thesis tldr everyone watched the yield curve inversion but its the uninversion that could mean the recession is coming soon the bond market is begging for rate cuts powell cant deliver the fed isnt here to save the market this is a policy trap and most people havent looked down yet and for you regards that can actually read so a lot of people talk about the yield curve inverting as a recession signal and theyre not wrong per se every us recession in the last years was preceded by an inversion of the yearyear treasury spread but it might not be the inversion that marks the start of the recession it could be the uninversion recently some analysts have observed that when the yield curve inverts a recession tends to follow in other words after being inverted for an extended period the us yield curve often turns back to an upward slope long rates above short rates in the final stretch leading into a recession in every case deutsche bank examined the curve had resteepened before the recession started in the past four recessions and the curve had turned positive by the time a recession occurred according to a deutsche bank analysis published last year the interval between a disinversion sic and the beginning of recession varied ranging roughly between two and six months in those four instances source over the last four cycles short rates have fallen back to their normal position below long rates that is the yield curve uninverts before the recession begins that uninversion has yet to occur source striked last sentence cause its normalized now why because thats the moment the bond market realizes the fed is done hiking and starts pricing in a weakening economy slowing growth and the eventual need for rate cuts in other words investors pile into longterm treasuries for safety pushing the yields lower id consider this more defensive than bullish basically smart money sees trouble ahead now the yield curve flipped back to positive back in august of before we really knew the extent of all this tariff bullshit so even though the curve isnt inverted anymore if its steepening aggressively like it is now for the wrong reasons its possibly a latecycle recession signal whats different this time around the market thinks the fed will cut rates soon to support growth but heres the problem inflation is still too high cpi is reaccelerating year inflation expectations just jumped from to and consumer sentiment just hit the lowest level since now lets add in trumps proposed tariffs whatever the fuck he eventually decides to implement these are inherently inflationary and even jpow acknowledges that so what happens when you combine i a bond market pricing in rate cuts ii a fed that cant wont cut and iii fiscalpolitical policy thats actively adding to inflation someone else dont remember who on this sub put it best this could be our wile e coyote moment where the market just hasnt looked down yet the soft landing narrative doesnt hold up under this setup if growth slows and inflation stays sticky powell wont be able to cut to save the market without reigniting inflation and importantly powell does not serve the stock market his mandate is stable prices and maximum employment during trumps first term he frequently criticized powell and he still raised rates markets are up on pure momentum and political optimism but the fed has absolutely no reason to intervene when that disconnect becomes obvious possibly the upcoming q gdp report on april things could get ugly anyways im probably wrong cause in reality nobody knows what the fuck is going on right now and as always past performance doesnt guarantee future results nevertheless buls r fuk my only short positions because im poor

1jzm3dm,wallstreetbets,2025-04-15 07:43:06,the yearmonth yield curve spread just uninverted considered by the feds to be one of the most reliable recession indicators the ym yield curve just uninverted on apr and nobody here seems to be noticing this historically if year yields month yields an inverted yield curve typically indicates imminent recession within months it has successfully predicted every us recession with very few false signals an inverted curve is usually caused by recession expectations while uninverting the curve signals imminent downturn inversion startinversion endrecession startmonths to recession mar jul nov oct apr jan sep jan jul jul feb jul jul feb mar aug may dec oct mar feb covid oct dec from to we had the longest period of inversion in history months and weve yet to encounter a recession the curve uninverted for a few months this year then it became inverted again due to tariff volatility then it uninverts itself again compared to the investor sentiment months ago i think theres more reason to be concerned now the closest example in history is when the us had months of inversion in yields that led to the worst postwar economic crisis the s economic crisis started with stagflation where inflation reached in after volckers hammer unemployment rate topped in the highest since the great depression the s economic crisis was caused by the postgold standard dollar since the us dollar became a fiat currency backed only by the us governments credit and not by physical gold making it a lot easier to print money excessive printing borrowing the us issued a lot of debt to pay for the vietnam war and great society in the s similar to covid qe without the gold standard the dollar devalued against other currencies causing the us to import inflation as oil prices surged in the s similar to tariffs after typing all this the similarities seems alarming in the s early volcker era the curve sometimes uninvert because y yields rose in response to inflation fears when uninversion comes from market forces rather than feds rate drops it reflects fear of higher debt supply which we should anticipate in the very near future persistent inflation tariffs loss of confidence in monetary controls now the curve has been uninverted again then what source

1jyoyk6,wallstreetbets,2025-04-14 02:58:19,leveraged forex betting on the euro to replace the usd as the worlds reserve currency imgur link to position ignore the long usd short yuan position i was bullish the differential between the two until recently and itll be gone for more usdeur after china reports export data in minutes ill probably settle somewhere between k to k eur over the last few days ive started to actually believe that mango man actually believes in his stupid tariff nonsense which has dramatically changed my outlook on the us economy lets lay out the current market situation treasury yields are spiking despite a huge increase in recession risk the dollar is shitting the bed especially against the euro there are a variety of reasons people have proposed like this being a treasury attack by a sovereign nation anyone who tells you this is a treasury attack is braindead but hedge funds being told to lay off the basis trades might actually be contributing to the volatility anyways my personal thesis for why treasury yields are going up is simple the market is pricing in that trump is actually serious about implementing his agenda lets look at the facts trump has infinitely doubled down on the tariff shit at this point hes staffed the administrative branch and the legislative branch with true believers hes amassed an extreme amount of economic and foreign policy power in his hands alone with zero oversight if he wanted to actually press forward he very much could he genuinely admires mckinley this in and of itself isnt actually a bad thing because he was actually a pretty decent president the issue is that hes fucking larping as him and following his tariff playbook when the economic situations are completely different back then tariffs actually sorta worked to do what they wanted them to do and therein lies the issue trump might actually think hes doing the right thing nothing more dangerous than an idealist who think theyre doing right going back to the yields for a second the us is on a totally unsustainable fiscal path spending is at of gdp fred link thats fucking bonkers for the peacetime usa and what does the fine president want to do tax cuts brother what but wait theres more trump has genuinely accepted hes going to hurt the economy in the shortterm and has been building up the political capital to do just that let me repeat that the usa already has an insane deficit in good times so were going to actively make things worse last time they tried this they created jobs at a cost of per job source american economic association good luck selling the us public on this the administration is jam packed with questionably sane ideologues i mean navarro really the living personification of source it came to me in a dream holy shit man the us government has suffered one of the worst braindrains a modern institution ever has in these last months you can think what you want about excessive government but going about it like this is a joke im gonna stop here but you get the gist of it his current and projected policy paths are genuinely insane when you get down to it i was on the permabull train just out of raw inertia im canadian and investing in the usd and levered etfs over the last years has genuinely changed the trajectory my life so whats next who the fuck knows lmao but im guessing the euro it fulfills all the main conditions for a reserve currency capability to run a deficit responsibly political stability capable institutions depth of marketbond market and no currency controls and were seeing that recently with a huge shift to eurdenominated assets in the face of questionable sanity on the us side ive personally seen enough so im willing to bet on tariff man actually going through with all his shit edit someone posed a good question about the eu trade deficit in the comments heres my response the eu actually did run a trade deficit until at which point things started really breaking down for them because they werent ready worth shit for a real crisis they hard pivoted to exports to bandaid the economy without spending like crazy because the germans had a hardon for austerity till until very recently they still pushed hard for it but now were starting to see the shackles come off with the release of the debt brake and nextgen bonds thats extraordinarily bullish for their local consumption and demand id actually argue that the nextgen bonds themselves are one of the most bullish developments in the history of the eu with them finally having a riskshared supranational bond for eu fiscal objectives thats been just one part of greater union fiscal independence its not just some contributiondriven meme state anymore i think its exactly because their primary strategy of being exportfocused has basically no path forward that i think theyre gonna at least try to pivot to a domestic consumption economy like the usa practically speaking theres no shot eu exports will ever be able to compete with chinas over a long enough period of time and pretty much everyone can see that theres no shot the us competes with chinas insanely focused industrial policy either but the us obviously has the domestic economy running sort of perfectly whats been changing the calculus for me really is that the us policy has gone from basically flawless to basically incoherent genuinely starting a global trade war is way more of a headwind than anything else on your list there is energy prices are fixed by a stronger euro and a potentially cratered global economy population pressures are fixed by highquality immigration driven by greater personal consumption and standard of living there are significant benefits for a resourcepoor nation like the eu to push to become a reserve currency it makes imports cheap as hell proportionally and dramatically centralizes fiscal power in the eus hands i dont think their situation is nearly as fucked as its been historically they dont need to totally supplant the usd they just need to present themselves as a stable alternative that can actually drive growth which theyve already been pretty successful at the usdeur and the yield spreads between german and us bonds have been generationally positive in the eus favor these last few weeks tldr i made a pretty retarded argument in the rest of the op but in the near term i think the combination of gutting their global trade running insane deficits in a good economy and committing to more extreme tax cuts implementing extremely regressive taxation and massive cuts to social security is such a monumentally stupid recipe i dont think americas systemic advantages are anywhere near enough to overcome the headwinds and itll lead to a severe crisis of confidence if all that shit actually comes to pass

1k95jkh,personalfinance,2025-04-27 14:43:04,suggestions for navigating capital gains and roth ira limitations with sale of rental home after divorce settlement after years trying to get to finish line in messy divorce i am in my s and work in a pension job at the median usa salary my ex made a lot more money and invested in real estate in mid s and a roth ira he is older than i am and i foolishly let him take the lead on finances and he didnt want me to open an ira or invest in things after all he had one there was tend house the rental property and his pension would be great married over a decade kids etc anyway he retired early and still makes more than i do on his pension i am entitled to a bit more than percent of this pension he is entitled to a smaller share of mine years spent in school but contributing financially through student loans to living expenses and i am paying loans now plus child bearing time out of work and prioritizing his career there are other assets like vehicles but nothing big and then questions of things like spousal and child support i went into last settlement meeting prepared to discuss how we can simplify stuff and focusing on my getting a lump sum of his pension i want to start a roth ira and hoped to maybe roll k into that and then take the tax penalty on the rest and put most into a cd until i am in position to buy a house which i think will be in a year i wanted to keep some in savings as emergency savings too my ex has instead proposed he pay off mortgage on the rental property and give me that and we call it good more or less i am trying to figure out if this will suffice i looked up how your basis transfers and it seems like that if i sell the home that i can expect to pay about percent of the sale price in real estate commissions and fees but the capital gains tax idea is new to me and it looks like what he had as the basis on his most recent tax forms would be my basis with years of ownership making this a long held asset if it transfers to me but then it looks like i need to take sale price and subtract those selling costs and then computing at my income pay a capital gains tax which could be about percent of the amount i would get from the same according to an online calculator and i realized that there are contribution limits to starting up a roth ira since it wont be rolled over my initial thoughts had been to put money into shorter term cd to accrue interest until i am ready to get a mortgage and buy but now with the ira limits i am not sure about strategies etc it seems like i might need to insist on a few more other things to make this trade work for me but beyond that what are some moves to make here i was going to keep putting a smaller amount into the ira each year on a monthly basis but hadnt planned to contribute much k or less each year but it should been about right at k initial plus that amount to get me what i will want to add to my pension i am trying to be smart and set myself for good financial stability long term and this feels like my one big shot to do it to be honest my salary has not close to kept up with rising costs and i live in low cost of living area houses were affordable on my salary less than years ago and i have watched in amazement as it just keeps getting harder i can see a professional but gotta negotiate deal too so cant just pause this process tldr just learned about capital gains tax trying to find best strategy short and long term to be ok financially

1k94bmq,personalfinance,2025-04-27 13:46:05,last resort is dipping into k but cant access it let me start by saying i f have never had a good model in my life for responsible financial habits my parents were always mattress money people and didnt own bank accounts for most of my upbringing thats not to say that we ever had any money under the mattress but thats how they were they were never financially responsible and led to some very hard times growing up at one point we were homeless and couch surfing with different family members so when i got my first job at all the money i earned went to helping the family live fast forward to college and i started receiving all kinds of credit card offers with intro apr and being young dumb broke and wanting to keep up with peers i maxed out several cards by time college was over at this point i was kicking myself but worked jobs and was really trying to pay for my mistakes since then though it had gotten worse as i developed a shopping habit i was able to shake the habit a few years ago and got myself into a debt management company which has me almost fully paid up on my accounts but the payments are so high im struggling to pay my bills especially now that im now a single income household instead of two im on the last few months of the payoff program and i can finally see the light at the end but i dont want to choose between food or having all of my rent for those last few months ideally i would like to take out some of my k balance as ive already stopped contributing just to have more money in my pocket but its not enough unfortunately my retirement plan admin doesnt allow withdrawals or loans only hardship distribution despite being in a literal financial hardship i dont qualify since i havent been threatened with eviction yet or trying to buy a house which is also heartbreaking that buying a house qualifies but not wanting to prevent getting evicted doesnt im very aware of the taxes and fees and early withdrawal penalties and id rather take from what i have saved up there than struggle until i get in too deep of trouble does anyone know how i can circumvent these qualifications to access the funds that im fully vested in or what else i can do for the next few months obviously my credit score is super low so i cant get a loan or credit card for my expenses not that i want to get caught back up in that anyway any resources or suggestions are so appreciated and please no hate trust me ive beaten myself up over it constantly

from my full time job which hasnt been enough to keep pace with inflation my coworkers all have part time jobs i do a couple freelance website projects to get by i rent a month gardenlevel bacheloraesthetic studio apartment that is rent controlled in a top most populous us city i dont pay for electricity gas or water i split the internet bill with an apartment neighbor via a wifi extender the only subscriptions i pay for are a phone bill for month month gym membership spotify family plan at month and domain website hosting month i havent owned a car for five years so i bike to work when its raining snowing and below i had hoped that sacrificing vehicle ownership and shrinking my lifestyle would give me the freedom and control of my situation i desire but sadly they have only allowed me to break even every year total posttax spending for april which is lower than my average oddities are i paid for my annual gym membership in full and a gift for my nephew i created my own budgeting spreadsheet to track my spending last year i found the biggest area i could reduce my spending is food so i created a meal planning spreadsheet to help me cook at home more yay spreadsheets step i have an emergency fund with in it which is about months of my living expenses month in a fidelity cma step i have invested year of my pretax income to get the company match in my k since it has been offered to me step i am debt free meaning no more student loans car loans or credit card debt step my long term goals i intend to stay childfree and i dont plan to buy a house i will either move into my partners house or rent till i move into a retirement home my long term financial goal is to focus on retiring in at years old so i have plus working years before retirement i just got to step savings for retirement in my rpersonalfinance wiki flowchart journey fyi i am not following it strictly but using it as an outline to describe my journey my k only has k fidelitys general guidelines say i should save x my salary by the age of its retirement planning tool suggests i should save of my income to catch up in the future when i get to step save more for retirement i will calculate my currentprojected net worth and figure out the amount i should plan to save for my retirement my short term goals my overall investment strategy for is to increase my savings to year of my income to do this first i am contributing year aftertax to my emergency fund to help get it close to months of my expenses second contribute the max yearly limit into my hsa because i have a high deductible health plan hdhp third i will continue investing year to my k to get the company match i am uncertain if these are the best things to do emergency fund i use a fidelity cash management account money market fund spaxx currently at day yield as of to grow my emergency fund my current balance is which is about months of living expenses month contributing of my income aftertax to my emergency fund will get me to with is more than six months of expenses hsa different health insurance plans total cost to get to coverage is premium outofpocket max i want managing my hsa to be set it and forget it simple so i invested my contributions into one fund that has no expense ratio i have set a trigger to invest of new contributions into fidelity zero total market index fund fzrox only when the account balance is above reasoning being im young and healthy so the highest hsa expense ive had this year was i will contribute per paycheck biweekly so if i have two expenses that are or more in less than weeks my hsa cash fund will be replenished to in three paychecks setting this trigger i wont have to sell any shares to get cash and it will make the account more hands off sidenote my core position is fidelity government cash reserves fdrxx also is there something wrong about fidelity zero index funds with no expense ratios that i am not catching spoiler alert rant about us healthcare i was uninsured from to meaning no health dental or eye care insurance when i started my current job i chose the high deductible health plan because i was broke the low premiums coming out of my paycheck was attractive and i thought some health insurance would be better than none in past years i calculated how much to contribute so that my hsa balance would be near zero dollars by the end of the year it wasnt until this year that i grasped the risk i am taking on the trade off i am making by enrolling in a high deductible health plan my innetwork outofpocket limit is and my outofnetwork outofpocket limit is therefore the risk i am taking on is the hopefully low possibility that if i get in an accident and end up unconscious that i could be transported to an outofnetwork provider and charged before my care is covered because of this low possibility i should have invested in my hsa account to offset the possible risk that would cause me financial devastation that means i should max out my hsa for years x max contribution limit i havent seen other people post about prioritizing their hsa for this reason so therefore i am perplexed as to why not also to be honest i dont know how common outofnetwork surprises are the biggest downside with my high deductible health plan is the only thing covered is one annual innetwork preventive care physical checkup appointment even a standard blood work test is dollars out of pocket besides that one appointment i have to pay outofpocket before i can use it so its more just devastating medical debt protection as i dont dare spend that much each year i have a few medical goals ive been putting off that id like to complete including getting an updated dyslexia evaluation trying adhd meds for the first time getting lasik eye surgery doing a sleep apnea study for my snoring tests for prediabetes and going to a nonreduced ratesliding scale therapist previously i incorrectly believed that if i switched to my companys preferred provider organization plan ppo and then did all the medical goals listed above i would save money i ran the numbers double checked with chat gpt and found out if i end up maxing out both plans until i am covered my assumption that the copay plan would be cheap is not true see image clarification with outpatient mental health therapy being qualified as a doctor visit it is only copay and approved adhd meds only being a tier one copay the ppo plan at my company might be worth it for me if those two goals are the only ones i work toward in a year i think i am going to take the financial loss next year and select the ppo plan to get an experiential knowledge of if it works for me pretax traditional k available funds sorted by expense ratio my fidelity traditional k currently has k in it and i invest of my pretax income to get the company match total of income i have a rebalance notification to alert after a variance my contributions were invested into the vanguard target retirement trust ii fund until this january when i felt comfortable enough to choose my own investments from the funds available my strategy for selecting funds was based on three criteria index funds a low for work sponsored accounts net expense ratio of or less prioritize or less and an average annual returns aar over the life of the fund that is above i have a very basic understanding of how to pick funds but what other criteria should i prioritize when evaluating a fund i picked fidelity index fund fxaix and fidelity mid cap index fund fsmdx because they are index funds with extremely low expense ratios and respectively i kept in the vanguard target retirement trust ii vlxvx because it feels like a standard to compare my other funds to also for access to cheap bonds as i near retirement but i dont know if this is actually smart or not i was hesitant to pick fidelity growth company k fund fgkfx with its expense ratio but aar is impressive i picked putnam large cap value trust class ia peyax in a similar vein because its is subpar and its aar is pretty good ive heard the saying that past performance doesnt predict future success but at the time i thought these riskier picks might pay off this might be a lesson i have to learn firsthand today i used fidelitys portfolio analyze tool which is very neat but i still dont have a clue how to build a portfolio is there a visual tool that will show me if my current k funds overlap how do i create a diverse asset allocation with these available funds i read the bogleheads guide to investing and am realizing i overthought my portfolio strategy and bought too many funds i intend to minimize the number of funds i hold what funds should i select and at what percentages please tell me why you would do what you recommend not just invest in xyz also if you share the books articles posts that influenced your thought and i will consume them thanks in advance tl dr q what do you think about fidelity zero index funds vs index funds with expense ratios for my hsa q why havent i read any rpersonalfinance posts about prioritizing getting your hsa up to the innetwork outofpocket amount q besides the expense ratio what criteria should i prioritize when evaluating a fund q how do i create a diverse asset allocation with the available funds in my k do any of my funds overlap q for my k what funds should i select and at what percentages

1k8pgkf,personalfinance,2025-04-26 22:53:00,seeking some financial advice regarding roth ira k background i have a roth ira with a decent chunk of cash in it and ive already withdrawn contributions plus k in as part of buying a home when i am employed in my field i make too much to contribute to a roth ira i have a small traditional k for employer matches short of some extraordinary windfall i can contribute to a roth ira for which i assume means i can move money from the traditional k to the roth ira and could also have for but it looks like i am looking into this just a little too late whoops but if theres some way that date can get extended please let me know i have been unemployed close to a year now but i am in an employable profession and getting interviews its just hard in my industry i am actually losing money keeping money in the k due to the current stock market madness and paying administration fees for the account not a huge amount but its happening i seem to also be losing money on the roth ira with my stocks configured for growth as they advise you to when youre under and im not sure how i would make this stop either but i do have a lot more options of how to allocate the money in the roth than i do for the k so presumably theres some way to stop the bleeding there due mostly to medical living expenses while unemployed i have some credit card debt that is accruing compound interest at x annually if i were to start work tomorrow at my previous salary that would put me in the x tax bracket so im saying my tax rate for is likely to be equal to the interest rate on that debt i am considering withdrawing the balance from the traditional k and using a bit of the money to pay off the credit card debt and rolling the rest into the roth ira and i assume that of what i roll over would be tax free because im eligible to contribute how would i do this and is this a logical idea or a terrible one its really confusing understanding how you move money from a traditional k to a roth ira given the state of the market should i consider withdrawing the traditional k money and putting it somewhere other than a roth ira like highinterest savings because putting it in the roth ira will result in losing money how would i know if given that im unemployed i can use some of this money for something like mortgage payments and not be charged the penalty thanks a lot appreciate it

1k7o5db,personalfinance,2025-04-25 15:44:09,am i ready financially to quit my job and be a sahd so i m currently work an engineering job making about k salary and my wife f works in another field bringing in about k salary we are expecting a baby in october work has been pretty detrimental to my mental health and my wife and i have talked about me potentially taking the opportunity to take a break from work and be a sahd i have been recommended by a friends family and a few healthcare professionals to quit because its gotten pretty bad i am at the point where i have nearly exhausted all fmla pto and short term disability benefits i have been getting professional help from both therapy and medication for years now so after crunching some numbers and assessing our budget i think my wife should break even with our spending and how much she takes home monthly likely have some leftover but to be safe we are going to assume a complete breakeven this is still taking into account part of her paycheck going into her k to get her company match and also new expenses going towards the baby here is a rough breakdown of my personal financial scenario only debt is our mortgage with k remaining we saved pretty aggressively and payed off more than half the house and recast to get our monthly payment down to only about on a k house since getting it in mortgage rate k in a hysa k across various brokerage accounts k in money market account ready to be invested but still liquid as of right now k k invested k hsa about k invested and k liquid k roth ira invested investments have taken a bit of a hit with the recent market changes but these were intended to be pretty long term investments im worried about a few things although we did some budgeting i am still concerned of bleeding money due to some unforseen regular expenses down the road especially with a newborn increased premiums for healthhousecar insurances inflation etc im also concerned how this gap will affect my career in the long run i am wondering if this is career suicide im really concerned that ill be set back a few years and have to take a demotion whenever i do reenter the work force i worked really hard the last years to move up the ladder and am worried im throwing all that away i know its common for women to quit and be a sahm so there may be more sympathy when trying to reenter the workforce later i am not sure how it will be received reentering as a sahd assuming i couldnt find a job again do i have enough to retire living relatively frugally if not how long could it last me as of right now i can technically can pay off my mortgage completely with my savings have k left in savings and then just let my investment accounts continue to compound for the next years my wife could comfortably afford our monthly expenses and have more for savings and then allow all that to grow on her end i just personally feel more comfortable keeping a larger emergency fund right now until things play out more once the baby gets here also im torn between investing that in the market vs a guaranteed return paying off the house assuming we stay in our house forever could i in theory be set up for retirement assuming my wife keeps working this is a just in case scenario i would definitely want to get back into the workforce eventually but want to assess how close i am to retirementfire i am also scared of not being able to find good work again with how tough the job market is right now especially in my field some less financially driven factors i have been weighing we dont have family that would be able to care for the baby near us so the only options would be to either pay for childcare or one of us quits to be a stay at home parent we would also feel more comfortable if one of raised our child rather than trust that to strangers i also wanted to take the time to brush up on my mandarin its something i always wanted to do but never had the time or energy because of work i also wanted to raise my child bilingual like i was but i know my mandarin has gotten worse over the years so i think it would be a mutually beneficial endeavor for both the child and myself i also wanted to take the time to potentially assess a career change i went into engineering not because it was a passion but because i was decent at it and i knew it would pay well im not sure what else it is i want to pursue professionally part of keeping that savings around is if i do find something that im passionate about whether that be a projectbusinessfurther education i have some means to pursue that part of me wanted to quit months ago to enjoy these last few months of being childless not that im not excitied to have a child maybe take time to travel as well even if it means burning through some savings i keep holding on to this job because i hear about how rough the job market is right now and the uncertainty of the economy with the trade wars and other stuff going on in the world my apologies for the long post im very torn right now between quitting my job and preparing to be a stay at home parent or staying at it despite it being detrimental to my mental health but offering more stability in a somewhat spooky economy any thoughtsadvice would be greatly appreciated edit its funny how different and conflicting reddit opinions can be in another post on another account on a mental health subreddit it was a unanimous you should quit yesterday here its youre not ready to quit dont it so yeah im conflicted and at my ropes end despite getting all the professional mental health help but after reading a lot of the comments here it very much reinforced the idea that if i dont earn enough money i might as well be dead

1k7nv1h,personalfinance,2025-04-25 15:32:06,navigating advance due date and autopay for my loan hi all i owe k on my student loans it was originally when i refinanced about years ago k over years at with a discount if i use autopay which i do so an effective rate of my monthly payment is and autopay requires i pay the monthly payment so that is how much i pay per month my employer also contributes towards it per month k over years i have left but because the autopay discount requires me to pay the monthly payment of my employers contribution goes towards principle i took on this refinance because the rate was amazing and still is and i was married and the high monthly payment was worth it to get this low rate now though after a divorce money has been tight and i am looking to free up some more money monthtomonth currently i have my loan set to do not advance due date which as i understand it is what makes the my employer pays go towards principal and is why the monthly payment stays at using a loan repayment calculator i would pay off the loan in about months paying about in interest over the rest of the loan as my employers contribution is k over years and this loan was originally years the obvious predicament is that i am not going to be able to use all of loan repayment bonus from my employer as it is going to go towards principal and shorten the length of my loan so if i understand this correctly these are my options turn off advance due date my autopay will make the may monthly payment as usual and my employers will go towards the next due date so after making an autopay of the following month june i will only owe then when i autopay another in june and my employer pays in july i will owe then rinse and repeat in august ill owe in september and then in october i will owe nothing but will still autopay receive my employer contribution and then in november i will owe and the cycle will continue with every few months i owe nothing but autopay anyway i cant figure out how the exact math will work out in the longterm but it seems like this might make my loan last a little longer which would let me receive more from my employer as my employer contribution would rollover towards future payments turn off advance due date and turn off autopay and pay each month manually in may i will manually pay and my employer would pay bringing my total payment to the monthly payment of as turning off autopay would increase my interest from to i would pay off this loan in months paying about in interest over the rest of the loan which is more in interest but would give me more months of my employers contributions of totaling more free money since im paying more in interest this nets me more total and also allows me to reduce how much i am paying each month by freeing up some money though in this situation as i will be paying the monthly payment i feel like the advance due date option is irrelevant here because i am not overpaying so does my understanding feel correct in that in this situation it make sense to turn off autopay and eat the higher interest rate in order to capitalize on my employers benefit more and free up more money each month and of course if i ever leave this company i would go back to autopay

1k6xo1z,personalfinance,2025-04-24 17:12:10,trying to decide whether it makes sense to sell or keep first home my spouse and i currently live in atlanta we have a home that was purchased in for at we owe left on that loan we very likely will be moving to athens georgia where there is a lower cost of living we are trying to determine whether it makes more sense to rent in athens for a few years and save for a new down payment and keep this home as a rental property or sell this house immediately estimated around k and spend that on a house in athens alternative strategies are also welcome we know athens very well so we feel comfortable purchasing straight away if needed one big reason to keep the property is that there is a large mixed use mall development and walking trail like the beltline that is being built in the neighborhood so in two years the renter owner of the space would be able to walk to shops and movie theatres from our home very easily this makes me think the expected equity in the home will jump dramatically in that time any thoughts or advice is welcome thanks

1k97uil,Entrepreneur,2025-04-27 16:22:03,the best thing i did for my startup was to stop marketing to other builders one of the biggest lessons i learned while building products is that marketing should begin from day one long before the first line of code is even written yet so often especially in the startup space marketing is treated as something that comes after the product is ready the classic build first worry about the audience later approach but heres the truth if you wait until launch day to start telling your story you are already too late i have seen this pattern repeat endlessly especially in the ai space people keep posting their ai wrappers or saas tools in ai subreddits or startup communities hoping to grab attention but the hard reality is that most people in these spaces are builders themselves they are not your customer they are either working on their own thing or not looking to buy another tool that feels just like the last ten they saw in my own journey the biggest wins came not from marketing to the tech crowd but from focusing on the nontech audience the people who have no clue what stack you are using they do not care if it is built with nextjs python or some new fancy framework they just want their problem solved these are the folks who are not impressed by jargon they are not looking for the words aipowered seamless or stateoftheart they want simplicity they want clarity they want to know how your product makes their life easier the best thing i did was to stop pitching to builders and start talking directly to the general audience who actually faced the problem i was solving that shift alone helped me build my early customer base i tried sharing my product in places like reddit and twitter builder spaces and honestly it often felt like shouting into the void everybody is posting their saas project everybody is announcing their ai product it becomes noise the hard truth is that the people who care about your solution probably are not hanging out in these circles if i could share one takeaway it would be this talk to your actual customers not to your peers would love to hear how others approach this have you faced the same or has targeting builder communities worked for you
1k97sf7,Entrepreneur,2025-04-27 16:19:37,question for vendors and suppliers hi everyone ive noticed that in the vendor and supplier space especially for institutional contracts theres still a significant technology gap im a data engineer based in new york and i see that a lot of publicly available procurement data is difficult to compile and work with id like to solve that problem for example im currently building a database that shows what public universities are actually paying for various procurements starting with lab equipment from what ive found its extremely tedious to locate extract and organize this information individually from each university vendors and suppliers shouldnt still have to guess pricing in my goal is to expand this across many categories not just lab equipment but any type of institutional supply where better pricing intelligence would help businesses price more competitively if youre a supplier or vendor is there a specific product category youd want access to first would a realtime or nearrealtime institutional pricing database be valuable to your operations the idea is to make this available through a simple monthly subscription for me to successfully build this the ideal types of data would be publicly or affordably accessible be consistently available even if some realworld lag exists not already be compiled in a userfriendly way elsewhere lastly im not locked into this exact model if there are other related tools features or pain points you wish someone would solve id love to hear your ideas thanks in advance for any feedback you can share

1k8e0ye,Entrepreneur,2025-04-26 14:19:21,finally having the resources but no clue what to do with it so i have quite an extensive history when it comes to entrepreneurship with a background in engineering business administration and finance ive tried all kinds of things from early beginnings with an online shop in my midlate teens through trying to live off of trading poker all the way to wholesale and even a manufacturing business in my s but always ran into one main issue money back in my s i had very little resources and i feel like some of my businesses mightve had a better chance if i wouldve had more resources to pour into machines marketing etc i was just always very constrained and had to try making something out of almost nothing and it usually stalled when the first big investments wouldve had to be made then in my late s i stumbled into a different industry and started working as a consultant selling my time over the years this has turned into a quite lucrative gig raking in k usd after taxes a year but theres one big issue over the years am in my mid s now i started to really hate it i absolutely dread every monday and spend a considerable amount of time every week thinking about how to break out of this golden cage it is really wearing me down but then theres no way i could get myself to just give up on ky short of me physicallymentally not being able to do the job anymore and while i do have very noticeable signs of burnout by now i keep telling myself that it only takes another years until i can retire and that it will hopefully get better with the next project so this brings me to the reason for this post me seeking advice i was contemplating all kinds of options regarding how i could escape my golden cage and my ideal solution would be some kind of business on the side i work at least hweek and hardly have any energy left outside of work so my involvement would be rather limited although i could imagine spending at least hweek on it if i really enjoy it where i would make up for my limited time outside of work with money i thought about maybe buying an already established business in an industry i like and that i have some limited knowledge of eg renewables where the income potential would probably not be too far above my current income but at least i would enjoy my job or start something completely new from scratch in both cases i would obviously need to have someone else at least representing myself taking care of operations while i could only do the strategic part as i dont really see a business that i can only spend a few hours of my precious and dearly needed weekends on to take off before i could retire just grinding away for another years and since the question of so how much are you planning to spend is probably going to come up k in more or less liquid assets that i would prefer not to liquidate for it and about kmonth that im saving for my early retirement currently which i could use for any venture with the same goal instead if needed able to increase to kmonth tops so whats your take is this hope generally realistic or just a really bad idea bound to burn money with nothing to show for is there really just the option of taking huge risks by committing my main advantage also seems to be my main issue huge opportunity costs so while i do have the resources in terms of capital i do not have them in terms of time and acquiring both means huge opportunity costs of unearned income which makes every business started this way a lot riskier how would you go about this i do have a friend that bought a very small company about a year ago that has tons of company exposés that i asked her for to have a look at to get a feeling for what it would take and what i could expect if i were to buy a company but buying one also means a lot of additional risk and investment so maybe trying to start something cheaper from scratch would be the way to go eager to hear your takes cheers

1k7wxkk,Entrepreneur,2025-04-25 21:51:03,bundled services property maintenance company hey fellow entrepreneurs i have finally identified what i believe to be a solid idea but would like some feedback if you are open to it background i live in a high growth city which has experienced tremendous growth over the past couple of years and continues to do so to this day it has grown substantially in the housing sector with many new strata properties being developed the stratas are both for condo buildings and townhouses as this growth continues i can sense a strain on general maintenance work capacity to upkeep these properties another pain point is that a strata generally needs to manage relations with several different contractors for services such as interior cleaning vacuuming etc lawn and or agricultural maintenance and general contract work for property maintenance this presents headaches for strata managers as for each job that may need to be completed and for each contract they have a separate business to deal with sometimes just individual contractors and several poc for invoicing etc enter a single entity complete property maintenance contracting company we would develop specialized teams for each major service listed above this model would have several strengths recurring revenue contracts in a growing industry noncyclical work mostly and room for disruption as a consolidated property maintenance managing company the only apprehensions are as follows not a singular specialized trade company focusing on a single service and potentially lengthy sales cycle for stratas with established servicing contracts the latter is easily overcome as currently there are over new stratas currently being built in a mile radius with more to break ground over the next year the former well it might take time but if landing the first contracts goes well word of mouth and our reputation could be enough for stratas managers to look for us as soon as their contracts which are generally annual contracts come to expire please poke holes in this idea plan and or provide feedback if you have experience in any of these industries looking forward to the discussions

1k7uzn5,Entrepreneur,2025-04-25 20:27:45,rant why are there fewer and fewer unicorn csuites from modest backgrounds i m attended mit and i will designate myself as ceo my second cousin m is my best friend and ever since he was young he shared a similar ambition with me of attending an ivy league and later starting his own tech company due to the fact i am heavily supportive of his ambitions i decided to designate him as cofounder and cto my plan is that if the company becomes a unicorn and i cash out for another entrepreneurial venture i might designate him as ceo even though he is giftedtalented his parents and school system hindered his dreams and ambitions he is still resentful to this day about not going to an ivy tier university and its ripple impact in terms of job prospects unfortunately his parents are ableist and when he was diagnosed with autism back in his parents deliberately held him back against my friends wishes and my wishes we both strive for success it was not an auspicious environment and i wish wed adopt him but his parents would always abduct him back to their house to subjugate him even though he has performed decently think straight a in honors math honors science honors social studies and honors foreign language and bb in reading and self teaching material at grade levels ahead of his grade his academics were stifled because he was misunderstood by his parents doctors and teachers he has learned programming since age starting with htmlcss and later pythonjs at even though he hated special ed and wanted to be in gate adjacent clases he was in and out of special ed which crippled his potential caused ptsd and only allowed him to attend a school he complained was subpar due to it being an r university he attended the state school between january december received a for the first two majoring in cs and a for the last two majoring in it and he failed to get into any internships during undergrad despite applying to a few hundred only gave any callbacks he had huge mental issues due to family issues during the first two years of college it wasnt until summer when he got an it internship at a small bank and winter that he got a webdev internship at a law office he had invested s of thousands using his student loans into tsla since and made a big buck using it he later became an independent contractor web developer making k a year as of my friend has been paranoid that with my his shoddy education and work history our tech startup might not be taken seriously by investors vcs ycombinator or our clientele that is even though i received a good education and am equally intelligent i felt like he was egregiously betrayed by his family and felt resentful that they were building roadblocks that prevented him from attending his dream schools thats why i have been asking this question after seeing that even if they were from upper middle class to affluent upbringings like bill gates mark zuckerberg jeff bezos elon musk sam altman jensen huang larry page sergey brin sundar pichai tim cook etc they still perform well academically and have decent work experience from prestigious companies even if they attended a lower grade or no university like paul allen or sean parker some exceptions include jason citron steve jobs jack ma jan koum richard branson casey neistat and a former student at my friends alma mater paul english my friend has personally met paul english most on the latter list have above average to gifted intellect so they are in the same ballpark as my friend it seems that even though tech does seem more inclusive in reality it is more nuanced as the educational backgrounds of many tech entrepreneurs and founders are not that diverse as opposed to say entertainers people like mrbeast casey neistat michael reeves vitalyzdtv pewdiepie eminem and snoop dogg didnt have the most stellar education but they could still rise to success other fields that are heavily elitist include the finance healthcare and political sectors but even joe biden has attended the university of delaware one final remarks my friend switched from a private high school to an online school to do th th and th grade in a matter of months to attend college early at that same private high school which now costs k a year his class valedictorian attended harvard has met bill gates and several other notable people and has been accepted to yc in he has reached k followers on linkedin he reached series a funding status already on his ai startup he has secured m in funding tldr for the past years my friend has spent hours per week refining his cs skills working as a web developer and investing and now he has become a pro having several projects off the table his shortcomings in the first two years were due to his lack of education in algorithms he learned programming through a codecademy like website luckily my parents m f are part of vietnams elite so that facilitates the funding process i have a cousin who is head of one of vietnams biggest vcs and vietnam is a burgeoning market for my potentially revolutionary ai startup

1k7ois1,Entrepreneur,2025-04-25 16:00:01,how i learned to create an emotional support community specifically for being an entrepreneur serial startup founder tldr i learned through therapy and executive coaching that it was my responsibility to train others around me how to support my unique needs as a startup founder it saved my marriage and made my startups successful apologies for crossposting as this topic was requested by multiple subs important being an entrepreneur is a range from working for yourself gig economy to owning a small business to being a startup founder of a tech venture my example is the extreme of being an institutionally funded startup founder but this could apply to every case here are the main points i learned what joy meant they defined joy to me as feeling glad to be with someone in strength but especially weakness our brains respond to joy differently its easier to find people you celebrate wins and your strength with its way harder to find people who you want to be vulnerable with in your weakest moments i learned joy is different than happiness i dont have to feel happy to have joy in my life i dont include people who try to fix me i call it corrective complex which is the knee jerk reaction to give unsolicited advice in an attempt to fix someone and it kills joy we all have these people in our lives the ones that say this is what you should do and make you feel like shit when youre not looking for a solution i also stopped doing this to my wife and learned to say do you want my opinion or do you want me to just listen more you can imagine her response of the time i invited them into a joybased relationship i would literally tell people i trusted what i needed and learned to properly advocate for my psychological needs i explained to them that some of my psychological issues were unique as a startup founder while some were just the usual trauma from growing up in an abusive home and other stuff it started with my wife i learned to start with those closest then ran out we practiced with structure i had regular chat sessions with my wife she knows nothing about startups but she learned to listen and express that she was glad i was sharing with her i found a support group of other dudes we met on tuesdays they were not founders but husbands and dads like me i found a group of founders and did the same i now do this weekly with founders and teach others i manage expectations nobody is perfect and when i expect them to read my mind and know what i need that just sets me up for disappointment ive learned to accept people without letting their expectations force me to agree with them i manage the toxicity in my life very intentionally social media is bad for mental health if used in appropriately i no longer am on certain platforms and post only specific content i stop looking at posts where people are flexing how amazing their lives are i refuse to engage with people whose sole purpose is to try to make everyone miserable yes ill interact but not engage with those that are toxic if i have to i learned something called grey rocking to deal with narcissistic behaviors look it up but i also adapted a version called white rocking thats the main gist you cant do this alone and your ego will prevent you from getting help as always if you need it or even think you need it talk to a professional advice like this from strangers like me on reddit is the last thing you should trust alone i didnt learn these tools until i did oh and two great books i learned a lot from are susan davids emotional agility shawn achors the happiness advantage not affiliated in any way but it might save you some of the therapy bills i paid hope this helps somebody have a great weekend

1k7jdrf,Entrepreneur,2025-04-25 12:12:11,quick public checkin too much or just right my partner runs a small renovation business and he has been toying with the idea of leaving behind a bit of marketing material when he visits customers for onsite quotes just something simple that shares a little about who they are how they work and what the process looks like when working with them its a stepbystep guide of what they can expect when working with him its not a large companyjust a small handson teamand his gut says its a nice way to build trust and leave a good impression i thought it might be a bit much for a small business though and maybe overwhelming for the potential client i was also concerned that the potential client now has my partners flyer to show competitors which increases the possibility of the competitor having inside information to help them win the job i think that once the client has met my partner for the onsite quote he can go through it all with them i know i go off the website initial contact and then how someone presents themselves and provide info when they come to quote me i dont need more than that i wanted to get some fresh perspective is this kind of thing a good move or a bit over the top thanks in advance

1k7d5ix,Entrepreneur,2025-04-25 05:17:52,do you have a real strategy or are you just playing the digital game without knowing the rules in its easy to believe that digital marketing alone is the success formula for growing any business seo ppc social media ads and influencer campaigns get most of the attention but heres the hard truth digital marketing cannot succeed in isolation too many businesses pour money into ads and engagement hacks without realizing theyre missing the foundation that makes those tools effective that foundation traditional marketing strategy let me explain with a few examples lack of market research wasted ad spend a dtc skincare brand i worked with ran facebook ads for months with a good budget despite sleek creatives and solid targeting the results were underwhelming why they hadnt done any real customer research turns out their ideal customer was more concerned about clean ingredients than antiaging something they wouldve discovered with proper market segmentation and customers reviews a staple of traditional marketing no brand positioning no loyalty digital channels can get attention but they dont build trust on their own we studied a fintech startup with declining conversion rates despite strong traffic from google ads the issue their messaging sounded exactly like every other competitor no unique positioning we have to review to basics swot analysis competitive mapping brand storytelling after rebranding and tightening their core value proposition not only will their conversions increase but their repeat customers and referral traffic will improve significantly the suggestion we came up with tactical execution without strategic direction digital marketing often becomes a checklist post on instagram boost a reel run some google ads but without a traditional marketing strategy like setting clear objectives understanding the customer journey and mapping messaging to each stage these efforts lack cohesion most of the businesses are doing everything right digitally but leads werent converting they need to apply the classic aida attention interest desire action framework to their funnel need to align and restructure their content retargeting and email drip sequences and finally there might be an increase in leadtodemo conversions digital tools are powerful but theyre only as effective as the strategic thinking behind them traditional marketing concepts like positioning segmentation messaging and customer psychology arent outdated theyre essential before you tweak your next ad targeting or test another cta ask yourself do i have a real strategy or am i just playing the digital game without knowing the rules

1k6lcd5,Entrepreneur,2025-04-24 06:19:33,started a kayak rental business and scaled it to a month less than two years ago i started a kayak rental business with a few old kayaks for each and today have scaled to kayaks in a popular tourist destination i want to share this success story since i dont have many i can talk to about it and also to inspire you this wasnt my first small business started with photography then pressure washing and window cleaning then this each helped me with the next also all glory to god march revenue k april revenue k monthly expenses k here are few takeaways start small and scale up save as much money as possible and just start the hardest part is starting and pulling the trigger then slowly scale up as it makes sense find inspiration research of the best businesses doing what you want to do and learn from them dont copy and plagiarize but draw inspiration from them avoid debt but take calculated risks when it makes sense when i decided to purchase new kayaks for k each it was a scary decision but i had already tested the market with my cheap kayaks and knew this would accelerate the business cashflow your expenses when scaling similar to above save up cash for expenses or large purchases when scaling if you dont have the money to scale to the degree you want to maybe you arent ready yet use common sense and logic think logically and use that to your advantage i cant imagine not thinking this way with business but maybe it doesnt come naturally for all get counsel from others who are successful business owners and pick their brain track finances and set aside money for taxes once you start making a good amount of money have a cpa and let them help you but from the beginning track finances and learn the insandouts of what you will owe and your businesses expenses to write off learn how to do as much as you can on your own build your own website download photoshop and create logos signage google adsadvertising etc if you dont know how to do something learn how save save save this is a more personal thing but if your business is successful then my personal recommendation is to save and invest as much as you can dont increase your lifestyle just keep living and paying the bills that are necessary and invest the rest youll thank yourself in years have excellent customer service get reviews super important i have just about five star reviews and this is all due to making customers happy treat them well and be reasonable be quick to answer your phone respond to textsemails and be a good person utilize google ads if you are providing a servicebased business then utilize google search ads to target people searching via google for your specific service super worth it final thoughts learn a valuable skill and provide value to others if you have any questions feel free to ask below

1k6c0c0,Entrepreneur,2025-04-23 22:13:08,trying upfront web design for auto shops hey everyone im currently running my own web design studio that focuses specifically on the automotive industry mechanics auto repair shops car detailing car washes towing companies etc the reason i chose this niche is simple i genuinely love cars and i wanted to work in a space that aligns with my interests it feels good to work with business owners who speak my language and are passionate about what they do that said im starting to wonder if this niche is too low ticket when it comes to selling web design i came up with the idea of offering upfront websites with a month maintenance fee because i noticed a common trend while researching and talking to local business owners most of them wanted a professional website but were turned off by the high upfront costs that many agencies charge anywhere from to just to get started so instead of charging a big setup fee i decided to go the subscription route a subscription they can cancel at any time content edits updating business hours services photos etc security updates and regular maintenance monthly analytics reports so business owners can see how their site is performing basic support and advice for improving their online presence the idea was to make it easy for small businesses to get online without needing to invest a ton of money up front i wanted to position it like a utility bill something that runs in the background and supports their business every month without them having to think much about it but like i mentioned earlier ive been getting mixed feedback some shop owners still arent sure about paying month even when i explain whats included others just dont see the value at all its made me wonder if the problem is the industry the pricing model or maybe just the way im presenting it im aware that offering low price websites or free websites can be viewed as a scam or sketchy and i also dont want to fall in that category any advice on how i should move forward will be greatly appreciated

1k69ofi,Entrepreneur,2025-04-23 20:36:14,customer service isnt a department its the whole damn brand over the past few years ive been building a business that serves a very specific niche that is more like a community truck owners they are people who take real pride in their vehicles to a lot of them their truck isnt just transportation its a passion project a personal statement sometimes even their most prized possession whats the biggest advantage weve found in this space customer service real human customer service you wouldnt believe how many people reach out to us already frustrated not because of us but because theyve been burned by other companies theyve been ghosted after making an inquiry or placing an order waited weeks with zero updates tried to get in touch and couldnt reach anyone been talked down to when they finally did get someone on the phone and that last one its more common than people realize theres a serious ego problem in our industry some businesses act like the customer is beneath them like theyre stupid for not knowing every technical spec like their questions are a waste of time like they should feel lucky just to be allowed to order its this weird gatekeeping culture where the business tries to flex their knowledge instead of actually helping someone whos just trying to build something they care about i decided early on thats not who were going be we take a handson proactive approach to service we answer calls emails dms we reach out if we spot a potential issue before it happens we communicate delays and why theyre happening we explain return policies and fees in a human way not legalese and when a customer is upset we dont take it personally we try to help weve absolutely gained customers just by being the one business that picks up the phone and listens sometimes thats all it takes the truth is were not just selling parts were helping people build their dream ride and in a space full of egos and silence just showing up and treating people with respect goes a long way we also learned to stop hiding behind professionalism and start being real if a shipping containers stuck at port we explain that if a fee exists we tell people why being transparent and human has turned difficult conversations into loyal customers more times than not and if youre trying to scale this kind of culture it starts with the people on your team you need a work environment where people feel good feel safe supported not afraid to be themselves because when your team is happy they pass that on to your customers happy humans help humans customer service isnt just part of the business it is the business forget the ego serve people like they matter that alone will set you apart in any industry i am curious how others are handling customer service as they grow especially when trying to keep that personal touch without burning out whats worked for you

1k65xk9,Entrepreneur,2025-04-23 18:04:36,the most important marketing rule i follow when working with small businesses i recently wrapped up a project with a translation agency owner who needed help with market research and developing a messaging and marketing strategy after all the work done we identified three viable marketing options google ads quick results potential leads within months but expensive about month minimum to be effective due to the high cost per click cost in her niche seo much more affordable at around month but with a longer timeline expecting meaningful results in about a year linkedin a middleground option costing slightly more than seo but requiring significant time investment from the owner herself when presenting these options we made sure to be completely transparent about the pros and cons of each approach but the most important advice we gave her and what i want to share with other small business owners here is something i consider fundamental only invest in marketing initiatives you can genuinely sustain for at least months without seeing results in other words use money youre willing to lose heres why even relatively fast marketing channels like google ads typically take months before theyre properly optimized and delivering consistent results seo can take months and so on if you pull the plug after two months because youre not seeing immediate returns youve essentially wasted that initial investment without giving the strategy proper time to work at the same time never give in to pressure from marketing agencies or consultants who push the you need to invest in yourself narrative when you genuinely dont have the funds thats honestly bs advice for small businesses you dont need to spend k just to risk going broke if it doesnt work out you need to invest in campaigns you can sustain without threatening your businesss survival if that means going for an option that takes longer to give results thats fine as long as again you can sustain it when you invest money you can actually afford to lose even a failed campaign provides valuable data and insights for future efforts when you cant afford to lose that money a failed campaign might mean closing your doors this is my rule of thumb after years working with small businesses rather than corporations or vcbacked startups be damn careful how you spend your marketing budget and dont let anyone pressure you into gambling funds you cant afford to lose this might seem like basic advice but ive seen too many small business owners fall into this trap the desperate need for more leads and clients makes us vulnerable to that invest big or fail narrative leading to desperate decisions rather than wellthought ones finding the right balance between investment and sustainability isnt just smart marketing its one of the cornerstones of actually building a business from scratch

1k62ar6,Entrepreneur,2025-04-23 15:39:33,boring business vs saas why i am switching my focus from saas to a sweaty and boring business the appeal of a saas startup has always been intriguing to me i love how you can build something and let it compound while working remotely and from anywhere i have wanted this i have been working on this but the results big fat s i am not a super technical person i use mostly nocode tools and website builders like shopify wordpress so perhaps it has come to be time for me to move along i am going to aim for something else entirely stepping aside from the software side to build boring first i know this will not scale as quickly or possibly as large but it seems that there is far less competition in this space now additionally the success rate is probably far greater in terms of percentages of business turning profitable in this space simply due to the sheer numbers of people building saas and ai style businesses at the moment the follow on effect and idea once the boring business becomes profitable would be to deeply understand and then identify ways to integrate perhaps a saas or other digital business to supplement the boring business using the profits of the boring business to build this side out by hiring the necessary dev team to get it done i am leaving this open to discussion who else has done this or is thinking of pivoting from building online to irl with an online play afterwards looking forward to your thoughts

1jwdal8,wallstreetbets,2025-04-11 00:36:46,i allind and held k in uvix for months i finally sold first off i would like to preface this with saying my condolences to those who have incurred any losses lately it has been a very volatile week and i know many friends and family who have suffered heavy losses in their portfolio and are stressedanxious for the future to come with that i would like to share my experience betting against the american economy by holding one of the most volatile stock for months uvix as many of you may know vix is an index that grows rapidly when the market reverses from a peak i personally witnessed this during covid when tvix rose almost and the recent yen carry trade of august th when uvix rose ive always aspired to time the market successfully with uvix last year i felt that the economy was overextended for many reasons you guys may not agree that these are factors to what led us here but these are why i ended up taking the biggest risk of my life with such high confidence that the market would crash shortterm us national debt weve reached a staggering trillion debt a large increase of trillion postcovid to me this was a huge red flag indicating a looming recession especially since the market was still pumping ai bubble i think ai is heavily overhyped and the rise of nvdatech stocks were not really warranted i saw this as a bubble bound to pop much like the dotcom and housing bubble of terrible job market i think weve been experiencing a bad labor market across all sectors for a while now employers look to make layoffscost cutting in order to artificially inflate profit margins to boost stock prices which is not sustainable i do not believe the numbers released by the feds at all they seem suspiciously low compared to realworld experiences of people struggling to find work this article was one example suicide rate is apparently one of the leading indicator of a struggling economy in we reached one of the highest rate in the decade trump winning the presidential election i was aware of his tariff plans during his campaign and i knew that if he actually did implement these it would shock the market it was only a question of if he would actually deliver on his campaign promise or not which he did with all these reasonings in mind i had a confidence that the market would crash soon so i yolod my whole portfolio into uvix after election holding this ticker was mentally tough the market kept rallying from to postelection and my position was decaying and i was holding a k loss for the vast majority of the time many people discouraged my position and some think i should cut my losses i even isolated myself for a while because i was so sure of my bet there were two moments when i could have sold to break even federal reserve announcing no future interest rate cuts and trumps initial canadamexico tariffs but uvix didnt rise as much as i anticipated so i kept holding fast forward to last week trump announced a severe blanket tariff which crashed the market as we know it this was finally the moment ive been waiting for as uvix went from to in the span of days i kept my eyes on the news set my alarm to am to watch the market open uvix could rapidly droprise in matter of seconds and i did not want to sell too earlylate so i was shedding k shares a day to be safe k at k at k at on tuesday at this point i had k remaining and i was hoping that uvix would maybe rise to but then trump sent out the tweet that hes basically cancelling the tariffs which shot the market back up and plummeted uvix to luckily i was able to salvage and sell at on the way down it wasnt quite the finish i was hoping for but overall i did get to gain roughly k off of my k bet now that ive been able to cash out on the big spy crash ive anticipated i am completely out of uvix for now even if the market continues to fall i have full confidence that well eventually recover back to our previous ath so ill be dcaing into spxltqqq from this point on until we reach that price in the end i would not encourage anyone else to do what i did even with my conviction and accurate market reading i had to hold uvix for months which ended up being one of the most stressful thing i could do ive lost sleep became disillusioned with the economygovernment and absorbed more bad news than i could handle ive internally cheered for bearish news despite knowing it could mean hardship for many people i was somewhat lucky that trump did indeed enact his tariffs otherwise i may have been stuck holding a decaying position until it went to zero or was delisted in the end im just relieved that i could finally exit my large uvix positions and i will never allin again the way i did i hoped you all enjoyed my perspectivestory and i wish the best of you luck in navigating this volatile market

1jxlpvu,wallstreetbets,2025-04-12 16:51:25,i think there is still a huge downside risk for the us stock market despite the exemption for electronics so recently the trump admin made an exception for electronics eg smartphones computers etc so i wouldnt be surprised if we see the nasdaq and tech stocks jump next week that being said i dont think its enough to prevent a long term downward decline for us stocks or the us economy in general because tariffs on other nonelectronic items which are used by people on day to day basis eg clothing food etc have not been lifted yet this will definitely still impact smaller and medium sized businesses rising bond yields as governments and investors outside of the us sell their us treasuries which could pose a liquidity issue if no one wants to buy us bonds the reports of declining consumer confidence in recent months the us economy is consumption based and if consumers reduce their spending that will pose problems for the economy at this point i dont think it matters what the federal reserve does if they turn on the money printer with quantitative easing inflation will likely go up which hurts the average consumer if they increase interest rates this will raise rates on mortgages car loans and other loans which will hurt already cash strapped consumers the problems being experienced are due to fiscal policies not a monetary policies the fed wont save you donald trumps mercurial nature makes it difficult for business both inside and outside the us to plan for the future since tariffs can go on and off with a tweet as such spending will likely slow down since the future is too uncertain businesses outside the us in particular may simply choose to open up shop in other countries with a more stable business environment long story short unless the tariffs trump has implemented are greatly scaled back and other countries do the same in response and he stops making policy on a whim the us stock market is still in for some hurt of course this is just my opinion what do you think

1jo8uo2,personalfinance,2025-03-31 17:30:08,my friend lent me k in i want to now return it with decent interest a few years ago i was struggling during a career change and a good friend of mine offered some financial support keur during my darkest days its not much but back then it was the only thing that kept the roof over my head he never asked for his money back and time just kept on rolling now im fortunate to say im doing a lot better im planning to return the sum at the end of q after im done with my companys taxes i want this to feel as if he had put the money into a stable financial instrument with good steady performance over the timespan of years q q how much should i return update id like to wholeheartedly thank everyone for their input i honestly didnt expect this simple question to attract so much activity i think ive settled for it feels like the perfect middle ground annual return i want to be considerate and reasonable while at the same time managing the risk of my friend refusing the extra interest just like several people commented i went to check the sp for the period however if i return double the amount or even more on top im sure hell refuse it and if that happens ill have to endure a lengthy argument with him to give in and at least account for inflation is there risk of him getting offended i dont think so hes financially savvy managing a wellbalanced personal portfolio i think he would find it thoughtful my question was concerned only with the financial aspect of things of course as many of you suggested i would accompany the transaction with a nice gesture and plenty of gratitude my friend is well off hes the type of person you cant get a gift since he has absolutely everything he needs taking him to a nice dinner wont work if i wire him the money the same day theres no way hes letting me pay for dinner so im most likely taking him to some sort of adventurous eventexperience where i can pay in advance also thanks everyone for the kind words towards me that was unexpected now im worried my friend might stumble upon this thread cheers

1k3p788,personalfinance,2025-04-20 15:34:19,my house is on the market should i remove it update i cant believe im saying this but im going to stay after all i never expected to see this much wisdom and in some cases new ideas and perspectives from a reddit thread so glad i chose this sub i read every single response and i so appreciate those who offered any type of help original im not sure where else to turn for advice here so im hoping for someone whos experienced something similar i purchased my home in at interest it was immediately after a divorce and homes during that first year of covid were so scarce that my real estate agent actually called around to get people with empty homes to put them on the market just so i could take a look it worked i found a house for me and my kids that met all the immediate needs and also had amenities neighborhood pool and playground good schools centrally located etc what i didnt realize at that time is that this was a flipper home those new vinyl floors each board curled up at the ends or peeled over time had to rebuild the chimney remove a dozen trees remodeled a rotting bathroom i havent stopped improving in years in exhaustion i decided to sell just before i put it on the market only about days ago i calculated everything ive put into this house with the down payment mortgage payments fixes and remodeling ive spent around in just years i was stunned this house is the reason why i live check to check even though i have a great salary and any money i might need for things like a college fund or emergency fund is sunk into this house i also have very little debt i just need to pay off the k for the roof and gutters i had done last month i put it up for sale because im tired of it all i make good money but im a single mom and id love to relax instead of constantly fix problems im not handy at all and usually make things worse without a handyman or professional and this house still needs a few more changes flooring kitchen etc but theyre not urgent and can wait then of all things i put the house on the market during an economically volatile time its had showings but only about total in a busy market and when i look at other homes available on the market in the price range i want to go for theyll all require some type of major update too and i dont want the cycle to start over if i sell this place i could walk away with about k after expenses but even if i put the majority into a down payment for the next home housing prices are so high that ill end up with a higher mortgage which is ok if im not sinking k per year into repairs or improvements now that its up for sale im starting to have doubts this is the right move im exhausted in general and trying to find another home seems like another mountain to climb when getting this one on the market felt like everest i can handle the monthly payments and my sons and i love the neighborhood we get along with everyone and the schools are perfect am i having some weird type of sellers remorse before ive even had an offer ive never experienced anything like this before im making myself crazy has anyone else been in my shoes please note that this is the third home that ive owned typically i wouldnt spend even a fraction of this much on home upkeep i feel like i bought a lemon out of desperation and while i dont feel trapped maybe i should stay for sunk cost its a decent home i would just like to stop feeling like i live check to check to maintain it and if i do sell it someone else will be enjoying the fruits of my labor ugh i have so many other thoughts but hoping i can learn something from you all any advice edit one quick major thing i forgot one of my main motivations to sell the home has been a strange odor that happens twice a week or so that ive been tracking for over a year ive tried everything to find the source had multiple professionals testing for everything from radon to gas leaks and everything inbetween the kids cant really detect it but i work from home most days and it has been so strong at times that ive worn a mask to bed purchased air purifiers etc but ever since i put the darn thing on the market the smell has been near undetectable could be the roof and gutter repairs or any number of things i changed to sell it but its way more tolerable now this may be the primary reason for my sudden doubts but if it comes back ill be absolutely miserable here its the one thing keeping me going at the moment

1k0yyyr,personalfinance,2025-04-16 23:43:49,is it ever justifiable to use your emergency fund for a career opportunity ive been slowly building my emergency fund over the last few years and i finally hit that sweet spot six months worth of expenses just sitting there as a safety net its given me a real sense of security knowing im covered if something unexpected like a layoff or a big medical bill comes up but now im facing a bit of a dilemma theres a professional certification course ive been eyeing for a while its about and it could really help me level up in my field and potentially increase my income longterm the catch is i dont have enough in my regular savings to pay for it right now i recently had a bit of unexpected good fortune from a big win on jackpot city casino ca and it helped me pad the emergency fund a little faster than i anticipated so even if i took the out i wouldnt be starting from scratch but i still feel torn about it i know the classic advice is to never touch your emergency fund unless its a true emergency but what if using it strategically now could actually help prevent future financial stress has anyone else been in a situation like this would you consider it a smart use of resources or a slippery slope id love to hear how others have navigated similar choices

1jwnxeg,Entrepreneur,2025-04-11 11:50:15,unpopular opinion boring businesses are the one that actually works everyone talks about ideas and execution and yeah they matter but what nobody really prepares you for is how slow it all feels at the beginning you launch something youre excited you expect people to care but most of the time nothing happens no traffic no customers no feedback just silence and thats where most people start to spiral they assume somethings wrong that they picked the wrong niche that the idea isnt good enough so they pivot then they pivot again and again until they burn out or give up entirely but heres the part ive learned the hard way most businesses that succeed didnt start off exciting they just stuck with something simple delivered consistently and got a little bit better every week they showed up when it felt invisible they kept posting building emailing improving even when no one was watching eventually momentum kicks in but it doesnt show up early and it definitely doesnt feel glamorous people assume quitting means failure but often it just means the reward didnt come fast enough sometimes the biggest competitive advantage isnt being smart or lucky its being a little more patient than everyone else

1jyx5pm,Entrepreneur,2025-04-14 12:03:36,how losing my best employee nearly broke my business and what fixed it theres this false sense of stability that creeps in when things are going well clients are happy work is flowing and theres always that one person on your team who just gets it they manage the chaos they catch the things you miss theyre your safety net even if you dont realize it i had that person we used to joke that they had the whole agency mapped out in their head timelines deliverables tricky clients feedback loopsthey managed it all i could sleep easy knowing they were on top of things it felt like we were finally at that stage where things were smooth predictable even i remember finishing a friday knowing everything was handled that kind of peace in business is rareand addictive then one morning i got a message that knocked the wind out of me hey can we chat for five minutes that fiveminute chat changed everything they were leaving no drama no issues just moving on to something that made sense for them but for me it felt like a giant hole just opened up under our feet the days that followed were rough the kind of rough you only understand when youve built a business too tightly around specific people instead of strong systems tasks were missed clients followed up asking things i didnt have answers to team members were unsure who was handling what everything felt fragile i realized painfully that we had built a business on memory not method talent not structure and im not knocking talent i just finally saw how risky it is when its the only thing holding things together so i did what most of us avoid until were forced to i paused and rebuilt it started small a single notion page one checklist then another i sat down with the team and said if you do something more than once we need it documented we didnt aim for perfection just clarity there was some hesitation at first no one wants to stop and write things down when work is piling up but a few weeks in it clicked we were moving faster fewer questions fewer dropped balls everyone could see the difference we created a living playbook no bloated manuals no outdated pdfs real steps written by the people who actually do the work every week wed update it improve it turn chaos into clarity it wasnt glamorous but over time it changed everything now when someone joins the team they get the keys to our system they dont guess they follow and they grow if someone needs time off or moves on the work doesnt stop the process doesnt break notion surprisingly became the backbone of our business a simple tool we underestimated turned into the foundation for consistency and growth if we were to hire someone new today what used to take three weeks of handholding would now take just a few days theyd step in follow the process and the system would do most of the heavy lifting thats how i know this is finally working heres the thing i wish someone had told me sooner if your business cant run without one specific person its not a business its a dependency processes arent the enemy of creativity they protect it they free your team to focus on better work not just trying to remember what the next step is so if youre running a service business id challenge you to ask yourself what happens if your most reliable person takes two weeks off tomorrow would the rest of your team know what to do would your clients notice a difference if that question makes you uncomfortable good thats where the work starts start with one thing one recurring task write it down make it better each time tools like notion or even a shared doc can take you a long way just dont wait for the panic moment to make the shift were still improving still figuring things out but were no longer scared of growing and that feels like real progress if youve been through a similar moment or are in the middle of one id love to hear how you approached it what worked what didnt what you learned along the way and if you havent hit that wall yet maybe this story helps you avoid it if youre thinking about building your own sop system and dont know where to start feel free to reach out always happy to help someone get unstuck a simple sop template you can steal and use today title name of the task or process purpose briefly explain why this sop exists and what outcome it supports frequency how often is this task done daily weekly monthly ad hoc responsible who is in charge of executing it tools needed list any apps platforms or tools required steps step one what exactly needs to be done step two details and specific instructions step three add context or edge cases if necessary checklist optional you dont need to start with everything just start with whats repeating and painful thats usually the best place to begin hope this helped you

1jnhklx,Entrepreneur,2025-03-30 17:26:54,the ai will replace everyone mindset is getting out of hand i dont know when entrepreneurship circles decided that just use ai was the answer to everything but im seeing this mindset everywhere lately and its starting to feel disturbing you know what im talking about the posts claiming you can build an entire business with zero engineers zero designers zero customer support just ai doing everything the linkedin thought leaders explaining how ceos and executives will be obsolete within years ive watched friends pour money into ai tools thinking theyd save on hiring only to realize they now need specialized talent to wrangle all these systems together or companies that went allin on aigenerated content and code only to end up with generic products indistinguishable from their competitors who used the same prompts what really gets me is how quickly people are willing to discard the very employees who helped build their companies these are the people who believed in your vision when nobody else did who put in long hours because they shared your values who stuck with you through the tough early days and now theyre viewed as replaceable because ai can supposedly do their jobs thats not just bad businessits a betrayal of the relationships that made your success possible in the first place im not antiai by any means i use these tools every day and theyre genuinely impressive but theres a massive gap between ai can help your business and ai can be your business the reality is that businesses still need humans for things that actually matter genuine innovation understanding complex customer needs making strategic decisions building company culture and creating products that stand out from the crowd i worry about where this leads economically too if everyone believes they can build businesses without creating meaningful employment what happens to the broader economy to knowledge transfer to the social fabric that businesses help create what kind of world are we building where loyalty and human connection are considered obsolete maybe im overthinking this but it feels like were chasing a fantasy that will leave a lot of entrepreneurs disappointed and do real damage to the business ecosystem along the way not to mention the human cost anyone else noticing this trend or am i just resistant to change

1jmpk1w,Entrepreneur,2025-03-29 16:04:12,the lindy effect for startups is real and the ability to recognise it is a superpower kind of naval ravikant said the lindy effect for startups the longer you go without shipping a product the more likely you will never ship the product and as someone who has been working solely with entrepreneurs for almost years now i can completely attest to it i develop mvps for nontech entrepreneurs often first time founders and more often than not i can tell which entrepreneurs will actually get sht done and which ones are probably just wantrepreneurs theyll get stuck only talking thinking and dreaming about it its not even that theyre incapable of it as people its just that theyre not action takers they put more importance on protecting their ideas refining their vision and planning their strategies as opposed to just taking action and focusing on execution the most important part they lack follow through they think if they just think hard enough they can go from level to level without having to face the struggles and mistakes of the levels in between thats impossible on the other hand the ones who either have that true entrepreneurial spirit start as soon as they can theyre not afraid to do it imperfectly experienced or serial entrepreneurs share this trait too if you have an idea you need to execute it imperfectly and then based on feedback make it better cant sit in your room and assume what would make it better you dont decide that the market will analysis paralysis is one hell of a bich itll kill your drive slowly and you wont even realise it kill it before it kills you start immediately learning about this effect has made me realize that i have unknowingly become an wantrepreneur about a lot of my ideas that im underconfident about so naturally im going to immediately break the chains and start developing one of them i develop other peoples ideas for a living but its overwhelming to do it for myself im not confident in my nontechnical skills like business development marketing sales etc ive decided to take the leap and figure out the rest as i go because lets be real thats what id advise my clients to do gotta walk the talk ill try to post updates if there are any major developments wish me luck guys ps sorry if i rambled on a bit lol just super pumped happy to answer in comments if i have failed to convey something clearly in the post
1jui4nw,Entrepreneur,2025-04-08 16:42:07,i open sourced my side project and no one cared ive been running a side project for a bit over year shortly after launching i posted a showhn thread to showcase it while the feedback was positive the main complaint was that the tool is not open source for months i was on the edge wether i should open source it or not my main concern being that someone would steal the code and sell it under their own brand eventually i caved and decided to risk it if someone takes the code and builds a better business out of it so be it super excited about it i started spreading the word that the tool is going open source and radio silence it got some stars and a couple of forks but i dont think anyone actually browsed the code or anything it made me wonder this whole im not using this tool unless its open source is nothing more than hypocrisy because i dont think those people actually go through the source code to make sure its safe or anything for me the only benefit i see in a tool being open source is that i could build it and run it myself for free other than that i couldnt care less
1jt26fi,Entrepreneur,2025-04-06 19:24:10,can you be rich and still live a good honest life hey everyone im in the process of building my own business and have big goals of becoming financially successful im aiming to reach millionaire or even billionaire status eventually but at the same time i dont want my pursuit of wealth to come at the cost of my values and personal integrity i want to live a life thats grounded in doing whats rightbeing disciplined fair and ethical the problem is i sometimes feel like theres a fine line between going after financial success and maintaining those principles it seems like in the world of business and capitalism the desire to earn more can sometimes lead people to make choices that arent so great in terms of morality or ethics so my question is is it truly possible to get rich and still maintain those core values can someone become very successful financially without sacrificing their integrity treating others fairly and making decisions that are aligned with being a good person im really interested in hearing your thoughts experiences or advice on how to balance both these ambitions thanks a lot for your time

1jqfv05,Entrepreneur,2025-04-03 11:24:51,kept my cool when a client tried to scam their way out of our contract a reminder that business isnt personal i just wanted to share a situation that taught me a valuable lesson about keeping emotions out of business maybe some of you can relate so i had this client who suddenly decided they didnt want to pay anymore loved my work but just didnt want to pay instead of following our contracts day notice period they just announced one day that they didnt want any more invoices or work but get this they then asked me to do more work after saying that then came the ambush meeting they invited me to a coffee catchup but it was just to nitpick my services and manufacture reasons to break the contract classic move right ill admit i was initially very hurt exceptionally angry frustrated all those emotions we feel when someone tries to screw us over i started spiraling taking it personally questioning my work but then i had this moment of clarity a contract is a contract this isnt about me as a person its just business they made a commitment regretted it financially and were trying to weasel out nothing more i remembered reading about how all these business titans we admire branson musk disney they all faced massive failures and setbacks bankruptcies exploding rockets getting forced out of their own companies what made them succeed longterm wasnt avoiding these problems but how they handled them as data points not personal catastrophes so i pulled myself together documented everything and wrote a calm professional email referencing the specific contract terms theyd agreed to no emotional language no accusations just facts the funny thing as soon as i removed the emotions i felt in control again whatever happens next i know im handling it professionally anyone else dealing with clients trying to pull similar stunts if so how do you keep your emotions in check when business gets messy

1jui196,Entrepreneur,2025-04-08 16:38:12,steps to create a website that automatically generates clients so before starting a website redesign you have to know why you are making those changes as a marketing agency we know your focus has to be increasing the number of people who find you online and converting those visitors into leads and customers in other words improving roi users might initially react negatively to a new design due to the need to adapt so the reasons for the change must be substantial and aim to improve website performance you have to protect your important assets before making changes find your most popular and powerful pages and identify and record all inbound links from other websites and internal links you must know which internal pages provide these inbound links besides that it never hurts to determine the current search engine ranking for the most important keywords you may need to use an seo tool for that or hire an seo expert never forget the homepage is the most important element and provides the first impression your goal here is to have simplicity and clarity in your message a visitor should quickly understand what your business does and what you offer and a good way to do this is by limiting the number of options presented to users by organizing your services into clear categories as the central pillar of your website your blog should be easy to find without forgetting your homepage must act as a launchpad for all contact methods name phone email social channels and blog however a good homepage is not enough nowadays you also need a great landing page which is designed to capture visitor data and convert traffic into business opportunities if you are offering valuable downloadable content like ebooks you need to create a dedicated landing page to collect user information in exchange for the download your goal here is to remove all distracting navigation elements from your landing pages to focus the users attention describe the offer or downloadable content next to the data entry form and keep forms short and simple to maximize conversion rates you can be creative and offer a variety of downloadable content such as ebooks whitepapers guides tools templates and webinar access use some analytics tools to track the performance of your experiments and identify what works best focus on three fundamental metrics visits leads and sales for visits track how many people visit your website and where they come from for leads calculate your conversion rates how many visitors become leads by filling out forms and determine where these conversions happen and for which types of offers and for sales track how many of your generated leads ultimately become paying customers

1k0i7zr,Entrepreneur,2025-04-16 11:37:00,what really causes most new businesses to fail one of the biggest pitfalls for new businesses is not getting early feedback a lot of firsttime founders hold their ideas close afraid someone might steal them while the concern is understandable this secrecy often backfires they miss the chance to validate their concept refine it or get real input from the people theyre trying to serve by the time they launch its usually after months of building in isolation with too much time and money already spent another issue is the obsession with quick wins some founders are more focused on chasing viral growth or a fast buyout than actually understanding their customers or building a solid team its easy to overlook the messy longterm work of solving meaningful problems when everyones chasing shortcuts failure usually isnt about one big mistake its the small things that stack up over time whats your take on it have you ever seen a project or startup fall apart firsthand

1jxkbe1,Entrepreneur,2025-04-12 15:49:14,i helped a friend build his triathlon academy the moment i asked to be paid properly he cut me off it sucked but i also learned a lot tldr i helped a friend build his triathlon academy for almost two years doing photography content creation branding web design and more all while juggling my fulltime job i was paid about month for only months of that time the rest was unpaid when i asked for proper pay and a written agreement he got angry kicked me out of the work group and accused me of being all about the money it was a tough lesson in setting boundaries and i learned the hard way that respect and clarity are key in both business and friendships ______________________ a while back a friend asked me to help him build his triathlon academy he knew my background in creative and strategy work and i said yes expecting it to be a shortterm favor but it evolved into something massive over nearly two years i worked on photography videography content strategy brand identity social media management community building sponsorship pitching web development design and all kinds of writing basically i helped him shape the academy from scratch like it was my own and it wasnt just me feeling that way he repeatedly said i was part of the company part of the founding team that made me invest even more not just in the work but emotionally i believed in the mission i showed up fully even though i had a fulltime job i made time on weekends nights and during downtime to contribute however i could i was running at two speeds mine and his for all that i was paid month but only for about or scattered months across the whole period the rest of the time nothing i didnt push because i trusted that things would formalize once the business was more stable i saw it as a longterm investment in something we were building together but after a while i started burning out the workload was heavy and i was still treating it like a real job just without the contract stability or pay so i brought it up i told him i was happy to continue contributing but we needed to get things on paper a proper agreement a clearly defined role fair compensation moving forward thats when it all shifted he got distant cold then one day just like that i was kicked out of the work group chat no conversation no explanation just a message youre all about the money that hit harder than i expected not because i lost the work but because i lost a friend someone i supported from the ground up someone who leaned on me who i thought saw me as a real part of the team turns out that sense of youre part of this was only true as long as i was working for free and didnt ask for structure or respect looking back i ignored a lot of signs we never set expectations clearly no contract no formal role just vibes trust and verbal promises i believed i was helping build something wed both benefit from instead i learned that people will take what you give and sometimes disappear when you finally ask for what you deserve heres what ive taken from all of this people who value you will welcome structure not resent it youre part of the team means nothing without clarity or commitment your time and energy are valuable even if you care deeply about the project getting cut off doesnt mean you failed it means you stood up for yourself it still stings theres grief and frustration sure but i dont regret what i did i gained tons of experience sharpened my skills and learned exactly where my boundaries are next time ill approach things differently but i wont stop building just make sure if youre in a similar position you dont confuse passion with obligation respect yourself enough to ask for what you deserve and if someone ghosts you because of that they never planned to treat you fairly in the first place

1ju8fgx,Entrepreneur,2025-04-08 08:11:04,years in solo spreadsheet business making k a month now its been years since starting better sheets on april rd posted about it before on reddit my goal when i started better sheets was a month on the side of building a saas this year im averaging k a month from a variety of sources sure thats down from the pie in the sky k a year path i was on but its better this way lets talk about last year k in in i made of that from appsumo lifetime deals from selling on gumroad from memberships and consulting from courses sold on udemy from youtube partner program while diversifying my revenue i ended up lowering my total revenue but my business have been an absolute joy to run by myself lately im totally asynchronous and mostly autonomous that means i can build anything i want and usually do whats been super interesting is that while i wanted to be totally autonomous my consulting has been going well ive charged hundreds or thousands of dollars over the past years to only a few customers who i have worked with very deeply one client runs a m construction business and i automate their project management in google sheets they ask for automatic emails or automatic messages or moving rows through a sheet to another sheet etc and i code in their sheets apps script thats it the code base has gotten bigger and bigger and its been just iterated over the course of over a year of working together i really couldnt imagine where it would go when i started and its just a massive awesomeness of apps script goodness another client sells a spreadsheet template ive been automating sheetify just like above im absolutely amazed its been a year of iterating and its become an amazing app script k a month in in so far im averaging per month in revenue appsumo lifetime deals gumroad monthly memberships and consulting udemy youtube years ago i said i was just starting on udemy and yet to monetize on youtube now those two revenue streams are making up more than of my revenue combined why is less better more is more better is better more revenue doesnt necessarily mean i have a better life i wanted better sheets to be autonomous and asynchronous a business that let me work on what i wanted to work on when i wanted to work on it thats happened i made it that way i can make more money doing more consulting but having a couple clients now is really awesome the revenue streams are diversified every month a different stream has higher than average revenue sometimes people want to buy a tool sometimes they want to build something sometimes they just have an error to get through now i can offer literally something for everyone because youtube is a revenue generating part of my time i dont feel like i have to hold anything back i dont have to do a hard sell to get through the paywall i can work on a product or a template as long or as little as i want i can release a simple version and if its popular i can build a more complicated version im having fun see below when i mention the pranks i put out on youtube seo struggles subsided i was struggling with seo early on but just given time and a lot of writing a lot of videos a lot of hand wringing a lot of new pages on my site and a lot of waiting im doing well on seo and have clear signal of what i can do to improve each and every month got k clicks in the past months for a variety of google sheets tools i built and templates and formulas a year ago i found some interesting long tail keywords with purchase intent i successfully have almost ctr on those keywords now but the volume is sooooo low i realized also the vast majority of keywords in google sheets had a purchase intent not close to zero but literally zero once i figured that out i abandoned seo for the most part whats next for better sheets one personal goal of mine is to get to a month revenue from youtube there is a clear cause and effect of producing more videos equals more revenue so im trying many different things like creating super simple videos epic automation videos making products and just releasing the video on youtube also made pranks and launched them each in their own video im working on a new version of my templates gallery if you look now its a gallery of other peoples templates i found links to theres no reason to actually come to better sheets for that nobody just searches for google sheets generally to get a template they search for a specific template to fix their problem im going to flip the paidfree ratio ill start giving out a ton of templates for free right now im a little conflicted about it but will try to start small with giving away some i already made in videos just making it easier to find and download and copy the sheet then i think ill spend a bit of time creating more youtube videos that i can link to about templates key also will be to create the link on youtube to the template people can get for free what im particularly mad about is that in my research of other free templates i found them utterly useless there are some sites with really interesting written posts about free templates and then i go download it and its literally useless it might look pretty but thats it some have some formulas but those formulas are literally basic math not dynamic or useful in fact to use the sheet someone would have to write their own formulas i hope to change that i will try to provide outofthebox useful templates even if they are simple ama what else do you want to know im here to answer any questions you have

1jsowcw,Entrepreneur,2025-04-06 07:45:48,got k active users first month of launching my social media app for founders what i learned months ago i was building a saas and requested feedback in various subreddits i noticed that my posts got downvoted deleted or i straight up got banned from the subreddit for self promotion while i was actually just looking to get some feedback this led me to create my own social platform for founders the concept was simple i was going to build a hybrid between producthunt and reddit where founders can get feedback find cofounders launch their products and more the benefit of this platform is that people can discover projects via your profile and you are allowed to share what you are working on it also is tailored for founders there are specific categories for finding cofounders getting feedback or posting job offers i created an mvp as quick as possible i chose older technologies php to develop the app the goal was to builld something fast not use the latest fancy javascript framework for those familiar with coding i launched my product and i new i had to be close to the user to have it grow thats why i went to twitter and reddit i commented on all posts of founders where i could provide value for instance if they ask for feedback i check out what they are building and give them real genuine feedback i then kindly invited them to join my platform and explained the benefits theyd get from it in a way that doesnt sound like im trying to sell them right now weve only launched weeks ago and have k active monthly users this may not sound like a huge number but its really hard to achieve its true what they say getting a new customer is x as expensive as keeping an existing one thats why the launch phase is so hard what i learned is that you have to solve a real problem the real problem was that there was no good place for founders to hang out get feedback or discover each others products so i created it then after that the best way is to get users it to reach out to them personally comment dm tldr solve a real problem get your first users by messagingcommenting and providing value first thanks for reading you can find the platform by googling huzzler community
1jsuar3,Entrepreneur,2025-04-06 13:37:23,the answer to i have x what business should i start based on years experience this is easily the most commonly asked question in this sub and after being an entrepreneur for ish years id love to give my perspective having money saved up is great but fundimentally the amount you have saved up just informs the size of bets that you can make at the start and the risks that you can take now i am going to split this into two parts one is a simple take and the other a more complex view you have k here is what id do simple services and trades k is good enough to simple equipment like a utility trailer for hauling off debris or simple tool sets for small engine repair by the time you buy the tools spend a bit of money on a website print out basic market materials and have a little cash left over for working capital you will use all of that we have good friends who own a construction debris removal and construction clean company they bought a used dump trailer and charge load of debris and around for a construction house clean i personally did a hot tub managent company i got started for around but if you were to replicate the business and buy all of the same stuff that i acquired by reinvesting in the business it would be about k note dont quit your main job start doing your business on the side dont quit your main job you have k service trade business from above but with a bit of acceleration you have some money to spend on marketing or maybe buy put down payments on bigger equipment for example a dump trailer skid steer mini excavator will do wonders with k id go get a used dump trailer for k a new skid at down and keep the rest as working capital to cover months of more of payments ecommerce this amount of money will let you buy inventory or marketing to sell your products i used to do ecommerce drop shipping i grew to k a month revenue but it cost around k in cogs and k spend of fb ads small products if you have a mind for designing physical products this is enough to do small products i designed one that was like retail with cogs i used a d printer to moc things up then purchased an injection mold for k unfortunately drama with cofounder tables this idea web apps you can pay for hosting and use an ai gen tool like cursor to build a web app id have some money set aside to hire an off shore dev to solve key problems as well as money to market the product once again dont quite your day job you dont have enough to cover living expenses and startup im gonna skip a bit of money and go with k with this level of money you can probably buy some some as well as anything from the list above small retail shop enough for inventory and rent plus working cash medium sized physical products hire an overseas consulting company to just build your idea for you then use the rest of the money on marketing coffee shop small restaurant depending on where you are this will get you started in this space you would have enough money for rent of an existing building and some working capital airbnb long term rental use the money as a down payment on an investment property and rent it out you should have enough money for the down payment and a few months of mortgage we did this personally when we did our first rental we saved up cash and then just made sure we could make the payments if there were issues and there were our well pump died months in take time off of work to code and do web development pay your living expenses for a while to launch an online business better ecommerce where you can actually spend the money to develop a brand or hire some help k buy an existing business make it better mid sized restaurant bar or beer hall hell all of the things above with more money to spend on screw ups what about investment and loans my first companies were funded with investment money its an accelerant but to be honest they ended up as failures or just mediocre outcomes i personally believe its better to bootstrap something because you will listen to your cuatomers more you will be more focused on delivering value etc investment money has a time and place aka as an accelerant to an already working model but its not great to have too much early on you end up too focused on your vision and you dont spend enough time thinking about how to get to revenue quickly that it my guide i hope it helps someone

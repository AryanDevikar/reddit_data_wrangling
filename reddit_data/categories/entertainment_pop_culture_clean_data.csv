to come up with a perfectly bad sandler film entitled jacked up earlier in the year adam sandler was a guest on howard sterns show to discuss his starring role in the excellent uncut gems during the interview sandler made a joke about what would happen if he didnt win the best actor academy award he told howard if i dont get it im going to fking come back and do one again that is so bad on purpose just to make you all pay thats how i get them in a bad news bad news situation sandler wasnt nominated and hes promised to make a terrible film ill still watch it a few times regardless in an effort to assist the sandman with his terrible film i dug through all of his films and analyzed their posters to come up with the objectively worst sandler picture that could be made here it is jacked up directed by dennis dugan written by tim herlihy pg running time minutes released on netflix predicted tomatometer score predicted imdb score adam sandler plays a personal trainershoe salesman named jack goodheart who is married to janet goodheart also sandler using a very offputting voice they travel to an exclusive resort in costa rica to attend his th high school anniversary during the fourth of july weekend during the event rob schneider playing a terrorist and his team of henchmen hijack the event and take everyone hostage including state senator chuck finley terry crews and presidential candidate casey fitzpatrick maya rudolph during the melee jack and janet escape and the two use their past military experience and buff physiques to save the day this pg actioncomedy is entitled jacked up and ends with a jet ski chase at the hotels lazy river pool that circles the hotel the film is directed by dennis dugan and costars kevin james chris rock david spade salma hayek terry crews steve buscemi taylor lautner luke wilson peter dinklage maya rudolph and al pacino heres the first fan made poster ill add as more people share thank you ukelkith here is another fan made poster thank you utremetal another very fun poster this is how i came up with the storyline i pulled together his best and worst films to find patterns that appear here are sandlers lowest rated films on rotten tomatoes and imdb i drew a lot of inspiration from them also i tried to make this as objective as possible the ridiculous tm action comedy action hero jack and jill imdb two sandlers jet ski scene married holiday grown ups reunited with old friends married bulletproof action comedy the cobbler shoe repairman the doover action comedy reunited with old friend married grown ups reunited with old friends holiday married adam sandlers eight crazy nights takes place during a holiday blended hes a dad who travels to africa going overboard imdb lots of terrible boat action the week of imdb families get together for a wedding sandy wexler imdb sandler pulls a unique voice which isnt statistically a good thing heres all i research i compiled to create jacked up a trademark of sandlers latest movies is that he likes to travel to beautiful locations to film which is brilliant and why not the doover just go with it blended grown ups and murder mystery are examples of his penchant for travel the problem is the films have a lower tomatometer average than the films where he didnt travel to nice locations this is why he travels in jacked up sandler has several directors that he enjoys working with those directors are steven brill dennis dugan and frank coraci steven brill has a lower tomatometer average than dennis dugan and frank coraci however dugan is responsible for jack jill so im giving him the directors chair he did direct happy gilmore so this could backfire on me frank coraci directed the ridiculous but i love the baseball scene he also directed the waterboy and the wedding singer aside from you dont mess with the zohan which is brilliant and has a fun jet ski action scene his action comedies are lackluster bulletproof and the doover didnt win him many points thats why jacked up features an actioncentered plot his films featuring him as a married man have a tomatometer average movies featuring him as a single man have a average thus the marriage to himself think jack jill is included its a double whammy i picked tim herlihy to write because he wrote the ridiculous six grown ups and pixels average i do love his happy gilmore billy madison the wedding singer and the waterboy scripts though his pg rated films have a lower tomatometer average than his r and pgrated films for netflix m rating r and tv pg i included a pool because in airheads he is a pool cleaner who thinks about swimming pools also grown ups the doover jack and jill feature swimming pools they have low scores movies that feature sandler doing a voice have a lower tomatometer score than his regular voiced roles none of his fresh films feature a jet ski first dates jack jill and you dont mess with the zohan are all rotten in the ridiculous six grown ups the doover and bulletproof he plays a totally capable man who isnt an underdog like he is in billy madison and happy gilmore so he cant be a doofus during the action scenes randomly enough rob schneider shouldnt adopt some kind of stereotyped character because his makeupless roles have a lower tomatometer average than his stereotyped roles his lowest rated movies on imdb are going overboard jack jill the ridiculous sandy wexler and the week of these movies feature water exploits gun fights weird voices two sandlers and large gatherings these things are all in jacked up bulletproof million little nicky million and blended million are a few of his lowest grossing comedies in these films he uses a wild voice goes on vacations and engages in action shenanigans i left out movies like spanglish and reign over me because they arent traditional sandler comedies also billy madison and happy gilmore werent huge earners however they established him as a force of nature his first or last name couldnt begin with an r howard ratner uncut gems henry roth first dates robbie hart the wedding singer what does the poster need to look like he cannot be centered on the poster his best films punch drunk love happy gilmore funny people and uncut gems feature him centered on the poster the wedding singer reign over me and the meyerowitz stories dont have him centered however the movie posters that have centered have a tomatometer average the posters that have him on the left have a tomatometer average im going with that he rarely centered in his worst films there needs to be multiple people on the poster when sandler is alone on a poster his movies have a tomatometer average the movie posters with people have a tomatometer average more is good in this poster he needs to be holding something random in the cobbler poster he is holding a coffee cup this is important and the movie has an tomatometer score in the wedding singer microphone and happy gilmore golf club and the waterboy bucket helmet he is holding items related to his character he needs to be holding something weird like a can of sponsored cocacola also the posters that feature him holding an item have a lower tomatometer score than the posters featuring him not holding anything xb its best if his entire body is on the poster the movie posters featuring a fullbodied adam sandler have a lower tomatometer average than his partial body posters ideally the title would be in the center because jack jill and the ridiculous six have somewhat centered titles poster title centered sandlers on left side full body at least six other characters on the poster there you have it i cant wait to watch jacked up if you like this random post make sure to check out my other random data on reddit movies featuring snowmobile

8swmb2,gaming,2018-06-21 23:30:01,youtuber potates completely plagiarized a post i made on rfallout about fallout and passed it off as his own work the video is now at k views edit just wanted to thank everybody for their interest in this topic and in me as a content creator now that things are cooling off i will make an update thread a few days from now to let everybody know how things have turned out there are also hundreds of people encouraging me to make a youtube channel and i just wanted to acknowledge that i really appreciate your interest and may set something up but i dont have anything at this moment to share thanks everybody for their kind words and support im not sure why this thread was locked i didnt get a message from the mods about it i assume just because the thread has run its course and im okay with that edit i had no idea that this thread would blow up in the way that it has i only posted here to begin with because a buddy of mine posts here and he said it would be good to share and maybe get some exposure for the original post i am pretty overwhelmed with the amount of people who are taking an interest in this and i want to make it abundantly clear that i do not and will not ever support anybody who is dishing out threats and personal attacks against potates be better than that thanks potates has dmd be acknowledging the situation and owning up to it and does not deserve to be harassed and threatened over this he has been cool about the whole situation and i am willing to give him the benefit of the doubt and be cool back neither he nor i knew just how crazy this situation was going to get again i am asking you from the bottom of my heart do not lash out at potates do not harass him do not harass his family these actions are wrong and i condemn them wholeheartedly calling him out for his behavior is one thing but when you cross the line into his real life you have gone too far and need to reexamine your moral compass edit i am aware that potates has removed all his videos except for his apology i am not responsible for this and i have not filed any kind of dmca claim against him as we are settling things privately i have and will continue to encourage him to not delete his youtube channel as i believe he can and will bounce back from this controversy plagiarism is serious and there is a lesson here to be learned if he respects the content of all creators moving forward then his channel can become a positive part of youtube again it is easy to be angry at this situation believe me but i am always willing to give somebody another chance if they are prepared to make a genuine change and for now i am willing to give that chance and let things play out link to the potates video link to my post which he reads mostly verbatim off in his video without any credit to me or even that it is a post from reddit whatsoever thats a massive fallout info dump based on the noclip documentary that had a strong community reaction and got passed around a lot it took me a while to write up as i watched the documentary and i spent a nontrivial amount of time making as it clear and concise as possible using direct quotes whenever possible shout out to when he misread one of my points that said camps are saved as blueprints and accidentally said served as blueprints which is a nonsensical statement im passionate about video games and love to write about them even though im not a professional so to see something youve written being plagiarized after putting in time and effort to share that written content with people just hurts a little bit when youre looking for more opportunities to write in a way that will attract attention seeing somebody else take that attention can really suck he starts his video off at the gameplay section of my post and at the beginning switches up his verbiage a little bit so its not too obvious as the video goes on that stops quickly and he starts reading every single bullet point almost verbatim im not too upset because im glad more people got to see the information but i am a little irritated that he passes it off as his own work he reads the post like it was his script even the way he does the voice over makes it sound as if he is saying these things off the cuff when in reality he is reading off the words i wrote from a page i only found this video at all because i clicked it and wanted to hear new fallout information a minute or two in i realized that i had heard those words before because i wrote them heres the thing if he had shot me a message saying hey man id like to quote this post in a video id have said go for it if at the beginning of the video he had said something like hey guys i found this post on reddit id like to read you id be fine with that but the fact that he passes this off as if he wrote it all or as if he took the time to compile this information is definitely frustrating to me i feel like i put in the work for this and then this guy turned around and monetized it without even having the decency to acknowledge that it wasnt his edit i see a lot of you commenting on the video saying that he has stolen my content unfortunately it appears as if he is deleting all of those comments as they come in edit i tried to comment on potates apology video but the comments arent going through here is what i wrote if i am able to post it directly on the video i will do so in the morning edit it appears as if the apology video has been deleted hey im _robbie first off i would like to lead with the fact that i completely condemn anybody who is issuing any kind of threats to potates and his family nobody deserves to be threatened and harassed over a situation like this secondly i would encourage potates not to delete his youtube channel i do not agree that there is no coming back from this mistakes were made feathers were ruffled and lessons were learned i have seen smaller youtube channels come back from worse i have given potates full permission to repost the offending video under the agreement that i am properly credited and that we can work out our differences in private i truly believe in the value of giving somebody another chance and even in spite of everything i am willing to give potates another chance this whole situation got out of hand to a degree that nobody could have predicted me and potates are making things right between us in private as i type this and i am confident that we will come to an understanding

wc0201,Music,2022-07-30 15:29:15,taylor swifts private jets took trips this year landing her on a new report that tracks the carbon emissions of celebrity private jets article as the world quite literally burns and floods its important to remember that individualism wont really solve the climate crisis especially compared to say the wholesale dismantling of the brutal grip the fossil fuel industry has on modern society still there are some individuals who could probably stand to do a bit more to mitigate their carbon footprint among them the superwealthy who make frequent use of carbonspewing private jets and lets not even get started on yachts while private jets are used by rich folks of all kinds their use among celebrities has come under scrutiny recently with reports of the likes of drake and kylie jenner taking flights that lasted less than minutes in response the sustainability marketing firm yard put together a new report using data to rank the celebrities whose private jets have flown the most so far this year and subsequently dumped the most carbon dioxide into the atmosphere drake and jenner both appear on the list but theyre actually nowhere near the top which is occupied by none other than taylor swift according to yard swifts jet flew times between jan and july the window for the yard study totaling minutes or days in the air that output has created estimated total flight emissions of tonnes of carbon which yard says is times more than the average persons total annual emissions at least one more flight can be added to that list too the flighttracking twitter account celebrity jets notes that swifts plane flew today july taylors jet is loaned out regularly to other individuals a spokesperson for swift tells rolling stone to attribute most or all of these trips to her is blatantly incorrect to create this report yard scraped data from celebrity jets which in turn pulls its info from adsb exchange the worlds largest public source of unfiltered flight data according to its website yard based its carbon emissions estimates on a uk department for transportation estimate that a plane traveling at about kmhour gives off kg of co per hour that kg estimate was multiplied with both timespentinair and a factor of to account for radiative forcing which includes other harmful emissions such as nitrous oxide was taken from mark lynas book carbon counter that number was then divided by to convert to tonnes coming in behind swifts plane on yards list was an aircraft belonging to boxer floyd mayweather which emitted an estimated tonnes of co from flights so far this year one of those flights lasted just minutes coming in at number three on the list was jayz though his placement does come with a caveat the data pulled for jay is tied to the puma jet a gulfstream gv that jay the creative director for puma reportedly convinced the sneaker giant to purchase as a perk for the athletes it endorses while jayz is not the only person flying on the puma jet a rep for yard said we attributed the jet to jayz on this occasion because he requested the puma jet as part of his signup deal to become the creative director of puma basketball the puma jets tail numbers are nsc at jayzs request n the standard us private jet registration code referring to his album of the same name and sc for his birth name shawn carter without jayz this jet would cease to exist the rest of the celebrities in yards top do appear to own the jets that provided the flight data for the report to that end though its impossible to say if the specific owners are the ones traveling on these planes for every specific flight for instance swift actually has two planes that celebjets tracks and obviously she cant be using both at once so beyond the jayzthe puma jet next on yards list is former baseball star alex rodriguezs plane which racked up flights and emitted tonnes of co and rounding out the top five is a jet belonging to country star blake shelton which has so far taken flights and emitted tonnes of co the rest of the top includes jets belonging to director steven spielberg flights tonnes kim kardashian flights tonnes mark wahlberg flights tones oprah winfrey flights tonnes and travis scott flights tonnes reps for the other nine celebrities in the top of yards list did not immediately return rolling stones request for comment as for the two celebs who helped inspire yards study kylie jenners jet landed all the way down at number flights tonnes sandwiched between jim carey and tom cruise and drakes plane popped up at number flights tonnes in between golfer jack nicklaus and kenny chesney while jenner has yet to address her minute flight drake did respond to some criticism on instagram by noting that nobody was even on the sevenminute minute and minute flights his boeing took during a sixweek span the explanation in all honesty doesnt do him any favors this is just them moving planes to whatever airport they are being stored at for anyone who was interested in the logistics nobody takes that flight drake said a rep for drake did not immediately return rolling stones request for further comment

1k95szv,movies,2025-04-27 14:54:54,perfect days hit me harder than i expectedpure life lessons hidden in silence so today i watched perfect days japanese movie and honestlyi didnt expect it to leave such a strong impact at first it feels so simple just a guy living his everyday life cleaning toilets listening to old cassettes taking pictures of trees but the more you watch the more you realize how much peace and depth there is behind his routine one thing that stood out to me was how he smiles at the sky every morning like hes genuinely grateful for another day no rush no complaints justexisting with full heart he doesnt talk much unless necessary but when he does interact like with his niece or that random guy he plays shadow games with you can feel how much he enjoys human connection too hes not avoiding peoplehe just doesnt need noise to be happy theres this beautiful bittersweetness hes not choosing loneliness in a sad wayits more like life took him down this path and instead of fighting it he embraced it with full acceptance thats powerful in todays world where everyone feels pressure to chase something constantly the scene where his niece leaves and he quietly criesman that hit different not because hes weak or regretting but because even the strongest hearts carry a little sadness somewhere deep and that final drivethe way he smiles and then tears up while listening to music that was pure life itself happiness sadness memories gratitudeall flowing through him at once honestly gave me the same vibe i felt after watching shawshank redemptionthe idea that freedom and peace are an inside job no matter what life gives or takes away one of the most beautiful movies ive ever watched without trying to be loud about it i liked the whole silent treatment vibe also im surprised how not many people talk about this movie would love to hear what you guys felt after watching it
1k95pji,movies,2025-04-27 14:50:30,the rock review a few nights ago i watched the rock and i have to say it was not as good as i expected the film stars a year old sean connrey as an old federal convict who once escaped alcaraz nicholas cage with a name so stupid i thought people were making fun of him for the first half of the movie and ed harris as a general who wants to get revenge on the governement by threatening to launch missiles at la i am going to say that i quite like the fact that tony todd and another mercenary got to be the main villains by the end of the story but for the first half they were just mercenary and mercenary having no plot relevence at all this film is often considered die hard on an island but it takes an hour for cage and connrey to get to the island also there isnt a single bad performance in this movie and no matter what movie it is thats always a plus over all this film is fine

1k8nbug,movies,2025-04-26 21:10:57,the notebook a movie about love the first time i watched this movie i did so with my now fiancé about years after it had come out i just simply never got around to it why is this probably because i was told it was a romance movie i love romance and love but i am a boy in our society girls love romance and boys love it when dudes are punching each other this is a stereotype but it has bearings of truth here is the thing though i loved the movie the notebook explores quite a few aspects of love there is the moment where our couple meets and has their first date we do silly things with the ones we love thats part of what makes love great we can be silly with each other i dont imagine myself lying down in the middle of the street as our main characters do but dancing without music and then singing if what noah does in the film can be considered singing a tune is a great glimpse into the things we do while in love later on when the love has truly blossomed allie says she is a bird and noah responds with if youre a bird im a bird this is truly romantic but out of context i find it to be kind of silly another area of love that the notebook shows us is the loss we can experience allie and noah break up mostly due to allies parents but with them being seventeen and living in different cities in the s it makes sense that they wind up no longer together we see it mostly from noahs side but he is depressed losing someone you love can feel like death he moves on in his life but it never feels like a complete life he meets a woman and they care for each other but he knows that he can never give her all that she wants because that part of him had left when he and allie were drawn apart on allies side we can see the confusion in love she is engaged to be married and to a man that is great he is successful smart good looking and caring for her the only thing he isnt is noah i do love that lon allies fiancé is a great guy too often in movies the person standing in the way of our two protagonists getting together is portrayed to be a jerk this makes allies decision to go back to noah an even more difficult choice lon has done nothing wrong and has treated her amazingly love has its ways though and it brings allie back to noah this last part of love that the film shows us is the part that hit me the hardest when noah is an old man and he has moved into an elder care facility to be with allie who has been suffering from a very bad case of dementia we see that his love is true and forever i feel bad for allie who is living a life of confusion but seeing the joy within noah when allie remembers him and then getting crushed five minutes later when she forgets again is heartbreaking seriously i just teared up typing that out because of the image on old man noahs face popping into my head when i watch this movie this is the part when i cry when someone we love is hurting or sick it hurts us too im sad if my love is sad and im happy when my love is happy the notebook isnt a girly romance movie its just a great movie about love finding love losing love regaining love and living in love

1k8iqzs,movies,2025-04-26 17:47:05,oppenheimer rewatch and thoughts oppenheimer discussion i want to start off by stating that i know im posting this very late the movie is almost two years old but i love it and wanted to share my thoughts and opinions on it nothing stated here is going to be a new revelation or a new discussion point that hasnt been brought up already but i want to know your thoughts on my thoughts you may disagree with some of my views but thats also why i wanted to share this to hear your opinions on it all fission and fusion oppenheimer and strauss alienation flipflopping and martyrdom oppenheimer and strauss are introduced right after one another as two sides of the same bomb they are both prideful men who went slighted will respond in different but similar explosive ways oppenheimer when made a fool of in front of his fellow peers by his instructor patrick blackett chooses to inject the instructors apple full of cyanide as revenge this response by oppenheimer shows that he is impulsive enough to attempt murder when his ego is damaged in front of his peers in my opinion it also shows that he does not think before he speaks that he does not think about the consequences of his actions in a sensible manner the next morning he goes to stop the apple from being eaten by his instructor patrick blackett but neils bohr who was not his intended target almost eats it oppenheimer created an object of death then regrets it when it is almost too late and almost kills someone who was not its intended target this happens to him as a relatively young student and throughout the movie he personally passes this act of humiliation on to his peers on multiple occasions this comes to bite him in the ass like a snake in your toilet oppenheimer has no filter in his thoughts and actions throughout the film all of this adds up and ultimately causes him to lose his security clearance and the privileges that come with it on multiple occasions oppenheimer humiliates his peers whether it be intentional or unintentional and this causes a chain reaction throughout his life that causes his own destruction the people who hurt oppenheimers security clearance case is someone who oppenheimer has humiliated first and foremost is strauss obviously strauss is someone who wanted to be respected amongst his peers but had an inferiority complex that is apparent throughout the film this inferiority complex caused even the slightest remarks to be perceived as personal attacks to his ego and place amongst his peers im not saying that there were not blatant slights made towards strauss for example when oppenheimer makes a fool of strauss in front of their peers during the shipping of isotope discussion however there are relatively little things that added up over time that strauss held internally until it was let loose in an explosive manner concocting the security clearance case against oppenheimer throughout the film these perceived slights included a insisting to be called admiral strauss when called mr strauss by his senate aide b responding to being called once lowly shoe salesman by oppenheimer and then correcting him saying no just a shoe salesman c at the aec gathering discussing the spy and filter paper detecting a russian atomic weapon strauss tries to give his thoughts to oppenheimer on what the committee should do regarding this but oppenheimer disregards him and doesnt even look at him when saying that strauss is not on the advisory committee and that he essentially has no say on the outcome d at strausss birthday celebration when strauss approaches oppenheimer at the bar with his son and fiancée oppenheimer doesnt even give them the time of day and essentially ignores them e the whole oppenheimer and einstein misunderstanding strauss thought oppenheimer soured einstein on strauss when in actuality something more important was going through their minds in actuality in was nothing personal towards strauss now i am not saying that strauss is entirely wrong in all of his perceptions of these actions and events strauss has a right to be called admiral being called a lowly is hurtful not getting looked in the eye by your peer and straightup dismissed of your opinion in hurtful having your son and his fiancée essentially ignored on your huge birthday celebration is wrong and having one of if not the the most respected scientist in the world einstein not evening look or respond to you must sting terribly when you hold that person in the highest regard what i am saying is that these things were blown out of proportion by strauss and some of these slights had nothing to do with strauss at all at strausss birthday celebration he thinks oppenheimer is indifferent towards his son and fiancée because he is preoccupied on the fact that it was revealed that there was a spy at los alamos and that oppenheimer was pissed at being wrong about that and pissed that strauss was right about that but in actuality oppenheimer was pissed about the hbomb program going forward oppenheimer still should have congratulated the engaged couple it would have been the easy and right thing to do especially if it was strausss son and on strausss birthday event but oppenheimer decided to be rude the oppenheimer and einstein discussion where strauss felt that oppenheimer soured einstein on strauss had nothing to do with strauss at all they just got done talking about how they might have cause a chain reaction that destroys the world their minds were preoccupied on that einstein had nothing against strauss obviously but strauss didnt see it that way any slight was internalized overthought and held tightly together and let out in an unhealthy way lastly oppenheimer alienated his peers throughout the film has conflicting thoughts and actions and plays a martyr throughout alienations oppenheimer on multiple occasions alienates himself from strauss mentioned above oppenheimer alienates himself from edward teller this is done by making teller feel foolish when teller brought up the creation of a fusion bomb but also on the multiple occasions where teller wants to know oppenheimers thoughts on the bomb but was never given a straight answer oppenheimer cheats on his wife with jean tatlock but also with ruth tolman ruth was richard tolmans wife and strauss tells ernest lawrence richards friend that oppenheimer was having an affair with richards wife which led to the death of richard this is one of the reasons why lawrence was going to speak against oppenheimer lawrence also sees the how oppenheimer disrespects his peers at the aec filter paper meeting and even attempts to call him out on it flipflopping and playing the martyr oppenheimer attempts to kill his instructor but says he didnt hate him and that he liked him very much to jean tatlock he insists at los alamos to call what theyre building a gadget but when its announced that the atom has been split he immediately makes the bomb connection oppenheimer knows what he is building he knows what it will do and he tries to convince himself that the bombs creation is an inevitability which personally i agree with he knows that the bomb must be built before the nazis build it he knows it will be used a weapon of mass destruction but he cannot come to terms with that after its use he feels like he has blood on his hands because he led the invention of this weapon but he liked the fame power and privileges that leading the creation of the bomb provided neils bohr states this theme when he tells oppenheimer that he cannot lift the stone without being ready for the snake that is revealed oppenheimer is haunted throughout the film by the bomb and what it will do the power it will bring and the mass destruction it will cause but the idea of being a bringer of death a godlike figure gets him off as strauss said oppenheimer wanted to be remembered as the leader in creating one of the most important inventionsweapons in history but not remembered for the lives that his creation took oppenheimer wants to have his cake and eat it too he wants to cheat on his wife but is distraught and wants to be comforted when his infidelity adds to the death of jean tatlock kitty tells him to his face that he cant commit the sin and then expect people to feel sorry for him kitty also states that oppenheimer enduring the security clearance ambush is a way for him to feel like a martyr to accept the punishment for the culmination of his actions oppenheimer knows what an atomic bomb will do but he spearheads its creation and then he feels like he has blood on his hands and wants people to feel sorry for him he wants people to tell him that there was no choice but to build the bomb and that he wasnt responsible for all the deaths while at the same time enjoying the perks of being responsible for the creation of the bomb when dropping off his son peter at chevaliers he says he knows that he is a terrible person and pauses because he wants to hear from chevalier that he is not a terrible person and that what he is doing is necessary in my opinion chevalier only accepted taking oppenheimers and kittys son in because chevalier wanted to stay on oppenheimers good side in order to pass on los alamos info to the russians at the end both oppenheimer and strauss share similar fates they are both denied what they are after oppenheimer does not get his security clearance approved and strauss is denied his cabinet position the cause boils down to each man alienating their peers oppenheimer is shown to do this time and time again throughout the film and strausss avarice towards oppenheimer is obvious to those in the scientific community who are paying attention to the situation to those whose minds arent clouded by pettiness david hill played by rami malek has little screen time in the movie but his role in my opinion is one of the most interesting even though hill was treated with disrespect by oppenheimer the first two times we see him in the movie oppenheimer knocks his pen down in one scene then his clipboard down in his next scene hill comes to oppenheimers defense in his third scene hill states that strauss has a vendetta against oppenheimer hill is able to see the bigger picture and not focus on these relatively small slights and hill doesnt try to get revenge on oppenheimer even though his only interactions with him were ones of disrespect i think hill is the level headed character to which oppenheimer and strauss should be compared he is doing what is best for the scientific community without letting personal feelings get in the way of doing what is right tldr this was mainly a summary with some opinions included i wanted to highlight how the film shows the nuances and actions that added up over a long period of time and led to major defeats in the lives of oppenheimer and strauss i understand this included a lot of obvious retelling of what occurred in the movie but i wanted to put it together in summary form oppenheimer and strausss desire to feel important and respected and their paths to achieve this are similar in a tragic way i believe this movie deserved all the praise and rewards it achieved and i think christopher nolan did a great job telling this story in three hours

1k7zxfw,movies,2025-04-26 00:13:09,i just finished the first rambo movie for the umpteenth time casually found while channel surfing and i genuinely feel the desire to share my opinion as a nonexpert i dont have the knowledge for a real review but to me this film is a truly jewel ironically in my country rambo may be used as meme its a joking for those person who throw themself headlong into a problem thinking he can solve all by themself what rambo represents however is the exact opposite he is a symbol of humanity fragility probably rambo is not a committed movie but how many other action movies deal with such important themes the amazing thing is how these themes are not exploited for political propaganda by those who perhaps are sharply aligned they are told for what they are in themselves and the impact they have on people how we are all victims because lets be honest whatever your opinion of vietnam war the pain the loneliness the contradictions suffered by veterans were tremendous and its something that can flood into broader contexts precious to show the damage of war not just during even after then we have even more how health is not only physical but also mental denunciation of police abuses the weak picking on the even weaker hatred of the unknown in favor of maintaining an illusory status quo one of the very few action films that does not overdo with exaggerations a film that within limits tries to keep itself realistic plausible the action is there but its secondary to the telling of the story of the protagonist and his message we talked about above youre not watching explosions jumps missiles fast vehicles youre watching the vicissitudes of a man youre feeling his emotions you can empathise last but not least i try to delve a little bit into the more technical part the shots the cinematography i love them they manage to make you feel the vibes of those places the cloudy muggy northwest the thick coniferous forests mountains the smell of rain and wet earth for me a hiking lover its simply something magical it feels like being there walking through the trees vibing and living a new adventure and finally this time for real how an ending is important to hold this boring wall of text together there is one thing that holds all these points of the film together the music there is little to say except that takes me back in time sweet nostalgia thanks rambo thanks to you all for reading

1k7nkmd,movies,2025-04-25 15:20:14,movies where the main problem is the director three years ago i was recommended _angel eyes_ by a friend whod said it had one of jennifer lopez best performances id expressed intermittent interest in her filmography previously but only followed up on this after another friend questioned my questioning her taste _angel eyes_ has a very weird reputation being mostly remembered as an odd artifact of earlys oprahesque glurge in fact the films male protagonist is a literal angel seems to be a somewhat common recollection that isnt actually the case there are no supernatural elements here but the end product is still just a meh drama not quite working on its own terms too grim to have much replay value whats odd is that there dont seem to be any major problems with the dna of the script written by gerald dipego this couldve easily been good with a minor passthrough _angel eyes_ is a psychodrama and to that effect the integration of its deuteragonists plot lines domestic abuse for cpd officer sharon pogue lopez traumainduced fugue for love interest catch jim caviezel would be a highyield reward for most directors for some reason darren aronofsky comes readily to mind the ending itself isnt even particularly glurgy if anything its firmly light at the end of the tunnel for the deuteragonists catch is a surprisinglycomplex balancing act at once severely traumatized wellfunctioning enough to spark romanticsexual interest in sharon without it being icky but im not sure that caviezel manages it as nathan rabin noted today catch comes off like hes autistic if memory serves this is one of lopez first paycheck roles post_selena_ and shes clearly more interested in the dv plot than the romance as a result shes weirdly thermostatic here alternating between great and good enough to an extent thats noticeable albeit the great moments are careerbest material the main problem really does seem to be director luis mandoki even to a casual viewer _angel eyes_ looks like a lifetime original movie on the level of craft in fact it looks like the lifetime version of a will smith oscar bait movie before will smith was making those types of movies mandoki is aiming for a dreamlike atmosphere especially wrt catch but it doesnt fully land and this hinders the integration of the two plot lines the dv plotline is fully grounded and as a result makes the misfires with catch look worse in comparison while a focus on the psychodramatic aspects wouldve probably bettersuited mandoki again i think just a better director wouldve been able to knock the script out of the park asis which speaks to this being a deficiency in directing craft and get a better director applies to the leads as well someone like aronofsky wouldve likely gotten caviezels performance to work better and kept lopez consistently towards the great end any other cases where the film wouldve been good if not for the director

1k7l7vw,movies,2025-04-25 13:40:53,weird question but is there an example of a movie where the end credits are black text on a white background instead of the usual white on black a very very oddly specific question but i only realized how common that form of end credits are after watching a series that had the opposite like the title of this post suggests black text on a white background so i was wondering if there were any examples of this reversal in actual movies or not
1k7kl56,movies,2025-04-25 13:11:58,i rewatched all of tom cruises films from endless love to mission impossible dead reckoning and ranked the running moments in his filmography earlier this year in anticipation of the release of mission impossible the final reckoning i decided to rank all of tom cruises running scenes in the mi franchise id worked on several mi data pieces for various companies and figured it would be easy to rank the ish running moments when the list was completed it felt incomplete so i decided to rank all of the running scenes in his filmography starting with s endless love and finishing with s mission impossible dead reckoning cruise had gone to extreme lengths for his films so i decided to honor his hard work by putting together this absurd list quick note his x handle always makes me laugh heres what you need to know about the list i found and ranked moments i counted running sprinting and jogging the amount of time doesnt matter either in top gun theres a onesecond shot of him running to hit a volleyball it was included a short blurb was included for list items timestamps have been included for the top some of the timestamps may be a little off for you it depends on wherehow you watch the movies for me it was a mixture of dvds blurays vudu and streaming channels i researched the top scenes and wrote more about them and included youtube links this list is obviously subjective but after going through cruises filmography for the fourth time since i am very happy with the top there is zero chance that our lists will match up so dont be surprised if the moments dont line up with your list for some of the scenes i split them up into moments i just went with the flow of the scene and if he stops for a moment or the scene cuts to someone else i split up the running moment into parts if youre interested in learning more about the top and this list i recorded a podcast episode about the data collection and ranking process its fun you should listen to it the podcast is called movies films and flix you can find it wherever you listen to podcasts i also have a show called deep blue sea the podcast that you should listen to as well heres the

when he starts running i dont think hell ever look faster on screen edge of tomorrow arrest this man in an alltimer cruise moment he tries to escape arrest and it ends badly youtube clip moments before brendan gleesons character yells arrest this man tom cruise delivers an alltimer cruise moment in which this dialogue is delivered i just inspired millions of people to join your army and when the body bags come home and theyre looking for someone to blame how hard do you think it would be for me to convince people to blame you id imagine the general would prefer to avoid that cruise enters gleesons office with total confidence and he quickly becomes a slimy rat whose escape attempt ends quickly its perfect and it makes his heroic transformation more interesting director doug liman did a great job weaponizing cruises charm in this scene and its fun watching a guy who cant escape an office building becoming a worldsaving soldier the firm the final chase scene he runs jumps goes up steps and this is when we get to see his true breakaway speed and hes holding a briefcase youtube clip the firm is cruises first film to fully showcase his soontobefamous running form elbows and knees we get a glimpse of it at the minute mark when hes chasing down jeannie tripplehorn but its not until the climactic chase that we see his breakaway speed for several minutes as hes running away from tobin jigsaw bell far and away in a neat transition cruise starts running so fast that the next shot is of an explosion talk about explosive running youtube clip i love how ron howard cuts from a sprinting tom cruise to an explosion its silly and it always puts a smile on my face i also love that the movie ends with the land run of mission impossible rogue nation cruise wipes out while trying to jump over a car it is very funny and the mi score helps make it better youtube clip this is mission impossible i cant just cross a street and get in a car mcquarrie talking about a conversation he had with cruise on the rogue nation commentary when putting together the top i always knew that this threesecond moment would be included its a silly moment punctuated by cheeky musical accompaniment and it proves that cruise doesnt take himself seriously its made even better by the knowledge that cruise came up with this bit on the day and he surprised the crew with his illfated car jump also the ensuing dialogue what are you talking about is delightful at this point in his career cruise was on a hot streak and its fun knowing that he was still totally down to make himself look like a dork mission impossible fallout iconic run across the building punctuated by a beautiful tracking shot dude looks amazing and he almost catches cavill youtube clip i loved doing this but it hurt tom cruise fallout bluray commentary watching cruise run across the blackfriars railway bridge is an alltimer cruise moment for multiple reasons it looks great and is a perfect trailer moment im jumping out of a window great line i love the reaction he gets from the people in the office they tom was still recovering from the ankle break he suffered during a jump gone awry director christopher mcquarrie said he was going for it the score rules its a bit gratuitous but the running makes sense in regards to the story mission impossible cruise runs from an exploding restaurant and does his first i look awesome while running in an action film work lots of fish die youtube clip that one was particularly very crazy talking about the scene on the graham norton show tom cruise was already a big star in but this moment made him a gigantic action movie star he had been in top gun sitting in a plane legend lots of rolling and crouch running days of thunder more sitting far and away boxing and the outsiders fisticuffs but mission impossible saw him entering a new phase of his career this moment was everywhere in and its one of the most iconic images of the mission impossible franchise it gets added points because the stunt looks legitimately dangerous and features some solid arm work from tom risky business a cigarettesmoking cruise wearing sunglasses at night runs up to some teenagers while the song mannish boy plays on the soundtrack this is the moment when cruise became tom cruise youtube clip starts at seconds wearing a suit coat black shirt black sunglasses and puffing on a cigarette cruise is strutting down the street and runs up to a group of classmates the moment lasts only seven seconds but its a turning point for cruise also the song selection is perfect vanilla sky cruise runs through an empty times square youtube clip the groundwork for the times square running in vanilla sky was set up in the film jerry maguire in the cameron crowedirected movie cruise dramatically runs through an airport and it looks great years later while filming vanilla sky crowe and cruise pulled some strings with the city of new york and were able to close down times square for three hours on a sunday morning in november the idea was that cruises character hates being alone and he dreams that hes alone in one of the busiest places in the world its total vanity but i love that cruise has a running scene in an empty times square collateral he throws a chair through a glass window then wipes out on the chair and just keeps running its his most aggressive running ever youtube clip starts at collateral not only features the best sitting performance of tom cruises career it also features his most aggressive running toms character vincent is a straightup killer and its fun watching cruise as he fully commits to being a coyote who chases down his prey with lightningfast footwork theres a moment towards the end when vincent is chasing down max and annie jada pinkett smith running in heels and he takes a chair to smash a window so he can run through it however cruise mistimedmisjudged the chairs trajectory and he wiped out on the chair and fell to the ground the neat thing is that he springs up immediately and keeps running its a perfect showcase for cruises tenacity and toughness and i love that the unplanned moment made its way into the film and so does mann who felt like it added to the realism of collateral its a secondslong moment but i love that nothing can stop cruise from running mission impossible iii cruise runs across some rooftops and then he sprints through a shanghai fishing village youtube clip in cruise had been running in movies for years and had some memorable sprints in war of the worlds the firm minority report collateral and far and away however his sprinting in mi which took takes to get perfect made people sit up and realize they were witnessing cinematic running history its the fastest cruise has ever looked and the spidercam rig that was built for the scene works perfectly as it tracks alongside cruise as he damn near goes plaid on the shanghai sidewalks during the bluray commentary director jj

1k7k5to,movies,2025-04-25 12:51:39,what are beaconaspirational figure characters who are also very wellroundedcomplex characters also how do they achieve this i ask this question because theres a sadly a tendency to write a lot of these badass and aspirational characters to basically be defined almost entirely by their coolest and positive aspects without letting them truly be anything more human and while it is valid to have characters who just simply represent the absolute peakness of what people can become and to just be cool this can become very stale and ironically they can be become so ideal that it is kinda basically impossible for us to truly ever imagine ourselves reaching those special qualities characters should have relatable interests flaws and just simply feel like people rather than just an idea moral or concept two of the best choices i can come up now with are ichiko shirayuri from kamikaze girls and juan from moonlight both almost entirely different films besides both sharing a similar message about embracing who you are and not let society choose how you can present yourself ichiko works both as a aspirational character and as a complex character because while she does fundamentally contribute to momokos character development in empathizing more with the perspective and feelings of others finds more beauty in her unique interests the value of friendship over solitude and in general is a girlboss and a symbol of rebellion who is very strong ichigo is also a character who is flawed shes short tempered very emotional lacking in some selfawareness ignorant at first insecure about herself and depends too much on her idol and gang to find validity of how she gets to identify herself she also herself needs support from momoko to be open about these emotions and conflicting thoughts shes having and doesnt just serve momokos personal growth but momoko also has to put her work to help her despite the story being very silly very cartoonish and over the top the film itself doesnt feel the need to make its main characters into simple caricatures of certain personality traits but it makes them human while celebrating having a style or archetype that you feel most comfortable with and whats beautiful is that the literal message of the film is about not letting others sharing those interests having to remove from your unique and intimate reasons for why you decide to take in this style you love juan is an extremely important mentor and father figure in chirons life he not is shown to be one of the few people in his life to genuinely care for him but he also serves as a symbol of positive masculinity helps chiron figure out his identity and sexuality subverts the myth that black men cant be good and present fathers to children and is generally very nurturing and cool guy however juan is not perfect he is a drug dealer and as it is revealed later on in the story he sold drugs to chirons abusive mother which mightve further contributed to the way his mother mistreats her and sadly because of this he cannot come up with an excuse for his actions and chiron understandably doesnt wanna talk to him after that he does say and does things that are very inspiring and help chiron but he also has done something that couldve hunted him too and leaves him to feel guilty it makes him into such a deeply tragic character and one whose qualities become questioned due to not completely leaving a few aspects of toxic black masculinity like his job even if we find him ultimately valuable as a figure

1k7ikjg,movies,2025-04-25 11:27:25,on callbacks and red threads or why i never use the term fan service i think that in popular film circles we have a situation of what we call in hebrew a generation who knew not their forebearers i often chuckle when people wax lyrical about oh paul atreidis story is a subversion of the heros journey or michael corleone is such an antihero and im left thinking fancy words we have had a term for that for two milennia its greek tragedy well the same applies to the dreaded term fan service its a term i never use because it takes something which had long been the currency in drama the callback or recurring motif and bastardizes it into something derogatory for no apparent reason in older forms of storytelling callbacks have indeed been a part of storytelling for very long indeed greek dramas sometimes repeated lines somewhere during the play or even across a trilogy of plays like the oresteia much later wagner did it for his ring heres wotan sir donald mcintyre the flying dutchman selfloathingly bequeating the world to the unborn hagen the nibelung son and heres hagen two dramas later calling himself nibelung son to the same notes it had appeared in literature quite often proust is especially notorious for having recurring motifs all through his à la recherche du temps perdu the phone constantly ringing the repeated allusions to pink and muave colours and much else beside in film callbacks have obviously been used in films people can philosophize about the appearance of oranges across all three godfather films and how they symbolize death but ultimately what all of these appearances amount to is a callback between the three films callbacks are also used within the span of a single film they dont even have to be lines they can be visuals for example sir sam mendes opens and ends by reproducing the very same shot red appears all through the sixth sense as all allusion to things touched by the undead this example is especially valuable because it engages with the underlying conceptual ideas behind the story these two shots from fellowship of the ring and the return of the king mirror each other theyre especially pervasive in soundtracks in revenge of the sith when anakin remembers giving padme the pendant from the phantom menace john williams plays the theme of the boy anakin when bilbo baggins recovers from his hrraagh moment the music is similar to when galadriel is coming down from her nuclear mode literally every time a theme like the socaled force theme or imperial march play it is a form of a callback and yet what seems par for the course on the soundtrack to a film for example causes some people to cry fan service like bloody murder when it is done in dialogue curious the function of the callback in all these cases and many others like them the callbacks serve a structural function they tie the piece together artists at least as far back as aristotle have strived towards greater and greater unity in a work of art and at the inverse of that to this day we often criticise films when we feel that they are too piecemeal in the th century writers spoke of this practice as a red thread that runs through the piece alluding to ariadnes red thread guiding theseus through the labyrinth carl maria von weber praised perhaps a little overlyenthusiastically ludewig spohrs faust for having certain melodies running through the whole like delicate threads and lending it a sense of artistic unity callbacks can also create powerful parallels and juxtapositions in the batman begins example above the fact that the first is rachel telling bruce and the second is the disguised bruce telling it back to rachel is meaningful on several levels not least because it allows her to realize whos under the mask but also because youre made to think back to a point in the film in which rachel and bruce were quite estranged but again what works for a single film is somehow derided as fan service when its done in a series of films even when they tell the same story in that sense callbacks are a close cousin to mechanism of setup and payoff obviously a returning line doesnt always function like a setuppayoff structure but sometimes it does furthermore often when there is a long span of time between a setup and its payoff even in a single movie the writer may insert any number of reminders to the setup thats entirely normal screenwriting procedure im trying not to fall into george lucas maxim of its like poetry it rhymes and ring theory and all this stuff because that implies a kind of more rigorous structural parity than most films including lucas owns aim for much less achieve this sort of thing was attempted in the th century where people attempted to make entire acts of dramas mirror each other in form and create palindromic aa or ternary aba forms weve generally moved away from this kind of thing in the interest of greater realism and film in particular tends to be a little looser structurally outside of arthouse exotica like satantango that sort of thing can also come too close to pastiche you cant in good faith excuse the force awakens or even return of the jedi for replaying entire swathes of star wars as a kind of structural exercise in parallelism nevertheless callbacks can create a feeling of a larger structure especially if theyre interspersed evenly through the entire work from start to finish like a web that holds the piece together in an unexpected journey the map transition from hobbiton to erebor mirrors partially thanks to the music the map transition from minas tirith back to the shire in the return of the king creating two bookends over the largest scope will people remember its not clear but artists have long believed that the way these things accumulate will at least get to us on a subliminal level at worse it can be regarded as something the artist does for his own artistic satisfaction like how kubrick would put things into drawers that would never be opened oncamera just so that the feel of the room was right to him but even barring these more complex uses of callbacks to tie the work together or create a sense of parallelism a callback can simply work as well a callback like the refrain in a song even on that most basic level it helps keep the thing feeling of a piecelike red threads tying knots through the piece callbacks in a film series seen as one long film obviously the extent to which a whole batch of films in a series are of a piece is contentious but i do feel like if youre a filmmaker embarking on or participating in the making of a film series especially one that has a central storyline like harry potter or star wars then it only makes sense for you to treat it as one giant story told in parts quite how succesfull that endeavour may or may not turn out is another thing but as a working premise its surely a good one to follow again under the aegis of the artistic ideal of unity in his directors commentary to an unexpected journey over a shot of narsil sir peter jackson says it will come to have a very big significance in the later trilogy even if people dont actually watch it in that order and many people will i do think that they will subliminaly be impressed with the conscientiousness that went into making it feel like one long film taking that line of thought of treating a film series with a single storyline as though it were one giant movie told in parts further some setups seem downright essential again in a single long movie you wouldnt want important characters or storylines to drop out of the story for too long only to then loop back in and you dont want to introduce characters or other narrative elements for the first time unless its fairly early in the piece otherwise it feels like a hail mary using subtle callbacks can help avoid these two traps within the longer span alloted by an extended film series see how chamber of secret subtly setsup the hurcruxes for the halfblood prince for all these reasons i think callbacks are a valuable tool and entirely par for the course in a film series thats why i never use the term fan service but it is being willfully oblivious to the benefits of callbacks and to the long storytelling tradition that they embody thats not to say all callbacks are equally succesfull if it all callbacks can anticipate later moments in a way that takes the edge of them when they actually happen in jrr tolkien objected to a story treatment for lord of the rings that by transporting gandalf across middleearth on an eagle he felt ruined the surprise of seeing the eagle rescue gandalf from orthanc similar arguments had been made that seeing jabba the hutt inserted into the original star wars in the special edition ruins the effect of finally seeing him in return of the jedi after hed been talked about all this time in those cases you might want something more subtle and subliminal for example in silence of the lambs as clarice admires the painting in lecters cell he says its the duomo as seen from the belvedere later buffalo bill is found in belvedere california this is not to say that lecter is knowingly alluding to gumbs location from the beginning but that its a device the writers use that when the name belvedere comes up again a part of us goes i know what that is ive heard that before and this helps with the sense of unity the ability of callbacks to create parallels and juxtapositions can also kind of expose weaknesses the callbacks in spectre to vesper from casino royale cause audiences to juxtapose vesper with madeleine youre left thinking just how much more impactful that relationship was then the one in the mendes film alas certainly in the attempt to make disparate films work together as a piece a callback can only underpin just how differently the films actually feel star wars is particularly guilty of this i personally have never able to in watching something like return of the jedi find myself really thinking about the lloydchristensen anakin and having my experience of the jonesprowse vader be informed by what befell them the films just dont feel cohesive enough for that and so lucas attempts to create a callback by having vader cry out noooo fall particularly flat in some cases the attempts at a callback exposes continuity headscratchers bringing back the lars homestead in attack of the clones with cpo already in the familys service does bring into question the fact that cpo is clearly a stranger to owen in the original star wars you can find ways to explain it from blinkered memory to cpos being a common model of droid and him getting his golden covering to owen just messing with him but ideally a movie series shouldnt put you in a position of doing homework to explain disrepancies obviously when a film series doesnt really have a central storyline the need for callbacks is not so great subsequently ive never warmed to temple of doom calling back to indy shooting the swordsman from raiders the fact that temple of doom nominally takes place before raiders hardly helps but even here it is valuable to tie the films together at least stylistically and so at least some amount of callbacks is stillwell called for how i learned to stop worrying and enjoy the callbacks but none of these bad examples make the habit of callbacks a malpractice as the ewww fan service crowd will lead you to believe as with any narrative device it can work well less well or not work at all but its still a legitimate widelyaccepted and longrunning storytelling tool and potentially a very powerful one there are lot of prequels sequels and spinoff coming out in the next few years and for all i care they can fill them to the brim with callbacks bring it on

tomatoes metacritic some reviews the hollywood reporter david rooney with hardy in fine form at the wheel havoc knows what its audience wants it also looks great with regular evans dp matt flannerys dynamic cameras zipping in and out of the bloody fray and textured visuals slashed with throbbing colors the setting is a city so grim and seedy it seems to exist only at night the fact that the environments were mostly constructed at a studio in cardiff suggests theres lots of ace craftspeople hiding out in wales slashfilm chris evangelista to be clear i love a good violent action movie as much as the next dude but you have to give me something more than just one extreme shootout followed by another perhaps if the hyperviolence was a little more stylized it would play better instead its just ugly stuff repeated in numbing fashion by the time havoc ended i felt as exhausted as hardys beaten and bruised character i suppose evans and company deserve some credit for making an action movie that really leans into the brutality but theres only so much of that you can put up with before it starts to grow tedious variety peter debruge theres a reason bigstudio producers looked to sundance darlings like colin trevorrow rian johnson and jon watts to handle their tentpoles not because those guys are great at action but because they keep the interpersonal dynamics interesting thats precisely where evans wreaks the most havoc ignoring or simply not understanding what connects us to such characters in the first place and therefore ensuring that his unwieldy netflix vehicle is dead on arrival nextbestpicture giovanni lago after years of waiting it feels like havoc was never going to reach the preconceived levels of hype that it was supposed to live up to its clear that whenever certain moments were filmed years later than the original period of principal photography mainly due to hardys more than apparent changes in beard thickness theres doubt it made any real difference in the final cut that evans envisioned still when havoc hits it only reminds us how awesome it feels when evans gets to do his own thing even a flawed gareth evans film satisfies more than most action flicks today empire beth webb theres also something refreshingly egoless to it hardy may have top billing but takes not only many sucker punches to the face but an entire roof to the head around him evans utilities his full cast throwing greener actors like quelin sepulveda who plays charlies partner mia into the eye of the storm armed with a meat cleaver and a mission to survive the result is a throbbing bonecrunching diorama of violence with the occasional horrifying glorious flourish youll never want to see a fishing harpoon again slant magazine jake cole instead of elaborate exchanges of closequarters strikes and counters the characters here tend to get the upper hand based on who has the quickest reflexes in tackling an assailant or getting a block up at the last possible second despite the advanced choreography that evans and flannery capture with a generally superior sense of visual fluidity than they displayed in the raid movies theres an overwhelming sense of chaos here that feels realistic nick schager the daily beast havoc is such relentless hardhearted business that the squeamish need not enlist nonetheless those with a hankering for escalating insanity will be well satiated by this saga whose narrative convolutions are untangled in a second half that puts a premium on combat disappointingly evans who wrote the script shortchanges olyphant in a role thats barely onedimensional and receives no standout momentsto a large extent because he shares only scant screen time with hardy the director makes up for it however with a barrage of broken bones and mutilated corpsesand set pieces drenched in slow motion and decorated with flying glass splinter and bodily debristhat tips the material into sensoryoverload territory collider tania hussain havoc might deliver on its promise of blood guts and glory but its these committed performances that keep it from completely collapsing under its selfinduced chaos while the vision by evans swings hard as a stylishly savage brawler it rarely lands with meaning which also feels like an injustice to the filmmakers incredible past work despite a toptier cast and bonerattling action to keep you engaged the netflix flick buckles under a cluttered story with chaotic execution its watchable even entertaining in bursts but beneath all the bruises and broken bones theres not much else to hold onto indiewire david ehrlich b rote as evans plot might be and wasteful as its treatment of certain characters definitely is pour one out for jessie mei li whose screen time as walkers new partner greatly outweighs her purpose to the story he has a welldeveloped ear for icecold gangster speak and he isnt afraid to make people pay a steep price for their penance its enough to forgive him andor the movie gods for making us wait so long to see him do it again

1k6xft3,movies,2025-04-24 17:03:04,why movies portray life as if were still in the s they ignore the fact that we spend huge amounts of time online namely in movies everyone is offline most of the time doing stuff in the physical world but this is not an accurate description of modern life people spend inordinate amount of time online were all glued to screens of our cellphones and pcs some people especially if they arent employed can spend upwards of hours per day in front of computer and for some people real events they participate in happen online be it engaging in esports chatrooms forum discussions playing chess online being a redditor blogger whatever some people are strongly influenced by what they read online to the point that it can change their lives some people practically live online some spend a lot of time talking to chatgpt and other ais and some even fall in love with chatbots like replika or character ai movies were traditionally always forward looking science fiction movies have anticipated some real inventions but movies have for a large part completely ignored that shift the fact that many people spend more time online than offline these days and movies still depict life as usual of course the most likely reason for this is that movies are all about entertainment and that portraying life of people who are terminally online would simply be boring like who would watch that crap right but not all moves are about entertainment some have higher artistic ambitions some want to portray life in a more realistic way some want to make some sort of statement etc so im still in a way surprised that there are so few moves that deal with our online life even social network which is about the rise of facebook isnt really focusing on any specific person whose life consists of spending time on facebook its about business dynamics in developing the company and most of it happens in physical world also even black mirror which is forward looking series dealing with the dystopian impact of new technologies online life is still mostly ignored do you know of any films dealing with our online life

1k5ljc8,movies,2025-04-23 00:03:04,we need to talk about kevin soi finally decided to watch we need to talk about kevin after finishing the movie i came straight here to see what people had to say about the ending and the film overall one question that keeps coming up is why didnt kevin kill his mother a lot of people interpret it as kevin wanting to punish her or provoke a reactionand while i agree with that interpretation to some extent i have a different take id like to share i think kevin didnt kill his mother because doing so wouldve given his actions a clear motive let me explain theres a scene where his mother asks him why he collects those crash cds and he replies there is no point thats the point that line really stuck with me it shows that kevin is fascinated by meaningless thingsthings that have no purpose which brings me to my theory he killed his father sister and classmates because there was no reason to his father was kind to him his sister was just a child and the classmates didnt really do anything to him there was no personal vendetta and in kevins twisted worldview at the time that lack of meaning made it worth doing but killing his mother that would have made sense that would have had a clear motiverevenge hatred resentment and thats exactly why he didnt do it at the end of the movie when she asks him why he says i used to think i knew now im not so sure to me that shows hes grown out of that phase of finding meaning in meaninglessness and now hes left with confusion and regret or at least uncertainty

1k5g26m,movies,2025-04-22 20:04:27,mistrial is one of the most eyerolling movies ive ever watched this movie is basically if somebody saw angry men and went but what if the jury was a buncha meanies and thats why you cant trust them while it started out pretty solid it went off the rails pretty quickly around minutes in spoilers ahead for this movie if you actually care to watch please dont the hero of this movie played by bill pullman what a waste of talent who is in charge of an investigation of the homicide of two police officers the first half of the movie revolves around his hunt for the perpetrator which leads him to the suspect who is an ex of one of the officers emotionally viscerated by the brutality of the crime our hero decides to forgo proper procedures catches the ex trying to flee which leads to a fight which leads to our hero shooting down the innocent wife and brother of the ex this ends with him getting a bag of evidence with some letters and bullet casings from the suspect the second half of the movie is basically a legal drama about how the mean justice system discarded these evidence under unlawful search and seizure with no warrant he shot those two people in their own home where they lived with the suspect btw which eventually leads to a jury finding the suspect not guilty now at this point in the movie where i was fully interested and a bit annoyed at our hero cops personality in how will they solve this case legally and get to the truth our hero shoots a gun in the courtroom right after the verdict is announced and takes the jury judge and the suspect as hostage this third half of the movie that just went completely off the rails is basically more than half hour of mostly a onesided soapbox peachy speech about how the poor police officer got messed over because of stupid things like rule of law and procedure in the meantime outside the courtroom the hallways are packed with armed police paramedics and a hostage negotiator the movie makes it an explicit point about showing how so many cops didnt wanted to go inside to subdue our hero because they dont want to shoot another cop because i kid you not one of them says that couldve been me chief ive been in some situations let me repeat that in this movie multiple officers of the law refused to engage in an active hostage situation with multiple people at risk because they were afraid they might hesitate the take the shot and that isnt even the most infuriating scene in the movie no no no the honor of most jaw dropping awe inspiringly bullshit line in the movie comes when the police commissioner of our hero manages to get inside the courtroom to talk him down which leads to our hero of this story our protector of the law to utter the lines he killed two cops and whats worse he made me kill the utter lack of remorse and guilt and the handwavyness reaction of once again the protagonist over his killing of two innocent civillians is just showed as part of the hardships of fighting crime to call this pile of mess a copaganda film would be a disservice to other movies and tv shows that actually make people want to become police officers because i refuse to believe this movie can be seen as any other way than highlighting the nature of law enforcement to support problematic elements just because they belong in the same line of work this is not my opinion btw this is literally whats inferred by one of the lines in the movie you know why they hate us captain because we have a code we believe in something we believe in each other treating the refusal of holding someone you know accountable for their actions as betraying the code the movie ends thank god with him finally surrendering while having achieved nothing he let the killer walk because of unlawful arrest he killed two innocent civilians during said arrest he destroyed his life and the life of his wife and two kids he got multiple officers either fired or demoted for not following orders and worst of all he wasted my time on this earth that i spent watching this godawful movie hoping any second it might turn around and give me a surprise of being an actually good one

have we seen the odyssey retold everywhere what springs to mind immediately are a pair of excellent films cold mountain and oh brother where art thou and a notasexcellentbutstillfun blockbuster troy more of the iliad but whatever and now we have the return in which an independent film studio and a european director use one of cinemas greatest actors to savingprivateryanize the story of odysseus i thought it worked wonderfully and the films emphasis on cinematography quiet moments nature and intensity were a refreshing break from normal hollywood bullshit the last movie i watched was the gorge so i admit to being biased in favor of something that doesnt completely suck possible spoilers for a yearold story ahead i come at this from someone who loves to read and watch films so just a fan im not an industry man not published never been to film school i have read some complaints about the returns pacing and some weak moments of dialogue i will not refute these complaints but i will just say they must have skipped right over me i was so immersed in the story and so athome with the movies strippeddown nature i found myself quite comfortable with less and never wanting for more the movie is carried almost entirely by ralph fiennes and juliette binoche and all you really need to do to understand whats going on is to watch their eyes i will say i thought the film struggled with the story of telemachus and what to actually do with him but the abandoned son of the king is supposed to be a little outofwhack isnt he anyway demythologizing so the movies main thing is the demythologizing of the story of odysseus instead of being captured and toyed with by the gods for a decade hes just been off somewhere too ashamed to come home without his men and too tormented by the killing hes done living with the trauma of war fiennes has a fantastic yard stare to bring this home especially when his blue eyes shine through a blood mask though this may be a toomodern condition to apply to a yearold story would a feeling of war guilt be anachronistic to ancient times maybe maybe not i do remember seeing a bible meets history show once in which they theorized joshua rested the israelites after each battle during the conquest of canaan for psychological reasons as they were slaughtering the women and children too anachronistic or not the deposit of values into different times makes for good art the mythology is beautifully hinted at during this movie of course i saw another post from months ago pointing out odysseuss answer of nobody when asked who he is and it comes back in the final battle not in the form of gods or magic but in his mythological prowess as a combatant when he slays an entire room of enemies sexuality part of the demythologizing of odysseus comes in the form of rumor on the island telemachus discovers his father has been living on an island with a woman the myth has odysseus captured by calypso and circe with whom he stays for years and fathers children the movie instead leaves this open to interpretation in our demythologized telling of the story we must assume odysseus was just out there shacking up in shame until he got the stones to come home we also have to make some guesses about penelopes sexuality the suitors allege shes either sleeping with one of their number or furiously masturbating and the movie doesnt really attempt to clear her name we can assume shes still being faithful to odysseus and is sexually frustrated this seems like the obvious takeaway as the movie gives us two scenes of her walking through the halls at night and being overcome with emotionlonging as she watches her serving girls fuck the suitors however she also does not hesitate to offer herself to antinous when he threatens her son as if having sex with him would just be another romp since this movie is all about humanizing mythology i think we can assume neither odysseus nor penelope has been completely faithful during their separation i think they hint this to each other during the bath scene at the end also juliette binoche has got to be the hottest yearold on the planet blood this movie is awash in blood appropriate for our warshocked odysseus the sea often appears to be dark and murky as though filled with blood characters shed it profusely odysseus wears it hard its interesting how often this movie mixes blood and water there are several shots of blood seeping into water from various wounds and the sea after all is the vehicle which took away the islands men so its a bloody place to them odysseus wears blood in various amounts throughout the movie despite numerous attempts to rest and recuperate and clean up he always seems to be bloody somewhere on his body and its not until the end when we get that closing shot of the blood spreading into the water that he is able to truly come clean and thats the big moment for the return odysseus comes clean about his life his experiences his infidelity everything

1k9onf3,gaming,2025-04-28 06:06:35,expedition is better than you might think let me explain for some context i generally dislike turn based jrpgs the closest ive ever enjoyed would be the xcom series i was not at all interested in the game until i saw the entire internet blow up over it so i reluctantly bought the game played it for hours tonight and i was hooked as soon as i saw the early love story tragedy in the opening minutes the game is phenomenal its only negative is the facial animations sort of suck because they were made for french dialogue which is very odd considering they have a star studded voiceover crew in english charlie cox daredevil even plays the main character so the faces do throw you off a bit the gameplay was the biggest shock to me because i rarely feel like stressing or minmaxing to try and play optimally for turn based games the game allows you to time your dodges parries which ultimately means you can do whatever the heck you want offensively as long as you can dodge i havent faced much adversity in the first hours all because i can dodge of all attacks easily so i get to experience all of the great aspects of a turn based crpg without needing to play chess in my head over which skills to use and when i use some strategy but man is it fun to just vibe on the medium difficulty and annihilate tldr the game takes all the good aspects of crpgs and then throws out all of the bad aspects of the games someone who hates the genre has found a way to love this game amazing music as well multiple tear inducing songs and countless other dope battle songs im looking at you underwater sonar dubstep

1k8tlyh,gaming,2025-04-27 02:28:45,clair obscur expedition is absolutely worth your time i know there are already a lot of posts and hype around this game already that a post like this seems pointless reason im making this post is often when a new game gets hyped a lot of it is so vague its just kind of like gameplay fun writing good etc and i just never know if to grab the game i saw this a lot for this game and i watched some gameplay but just wasnt sold in the end i decided to buy it as of the time i play the patient gamer and wait for sale so decided to go for it for once so i wanted to talk about specific things in the game that have just had me hooked and super glad i bought it and didnt wait for sale the story within the first hour had me hooked its just so unique and gripping normally stories take a while to engross me but i very quickly found myself looking forward to the next cutscene or story progression i realised even if i disliked the gameplay i would be happy to stick on story mode and just play for the story it really makes you constantly want to know what happens next the combat especially when it gets tricky is addictive i wasnt sure how i felt with reaction based combat in a turn based game but its done so well working out when to parry or when the dodge is a better option feels great a lot of it is very rhythmic fighting a boss and losing but coming up with a better game plan and then beating the boss and taking damage feels amazing like a boss might do a triple attack where each attack is like hit hit hit and as simple as it is it feels great to dodge parrying is more optimal as you counter attack but dodging has a much more forgiving window so when your learning a fight some of it also comes down to working out whats actually personally doable for you outside of that stuff the turn based combat is great lots of fun moves and lots of tactical thinking needed and its fun making the most of status effects and using each party members strengths the party customisation is amazing lots of synergies to create with your team and the talent trees are really well done and its fun trying to just get good synergy going on your team overall this game is just an absolute treat edit at one point i decided to play for like mins before sleeping i got stuck on a mini boss and it felt amazing to finally beat then my wife said werent you going to sleep ages ago and i was so confused until i realised it had been an hour and not mins you know a game is good when it does that

1k7k63t,gaming,2025-04-25 12:52:02,we need a new term for diablotype games on one hand youve got people misusing arpg to refer solely to diablotype games pretending that things like kingdom hearts simply dont exist on the other hand even me using diablotype game is kinda bad we really shouldnt be naming genres after specific games like this roguelike is already bad enough and i feel like we need a better term even for that i propose a new term itemization rpg it might seem a bit wordy but i specifically chose that word because people use it a lot when talking about these games like how many times have you seen a review or even just a critical post for one of these games where the person talks about good or bad itemization you can also just shorten it to item rpg if you really want i suppose you could also use loot rpg but something about that word sounds base and people love to talk about how these games are for the unintelligent enough as it is this term solves the above problems and it also solves problems like phantasy star online not being a topdown game or borderlands being an fps it also opens the doors to games that are not necessarily action rpgs i know people have thought about a turnbased diablo more than once and the original diablo itself was supposed to be turnbased even on that note some of these recent deckbuilding games are dangerously close to approaching this realm i dunno i just think the current situation is kinda bad and this is a good idea to make it better maybe theres a better idea but this just seems like a useful word here and we ought to cherish useful words edit yikes i was not expecting the unbelievable pushback and downvotes this is clearly a bigger problem than it already appeared pretty weird that lots of people get upset over metroidvania which is right to do but not about this guess ill just put my money where my mouth is and use my own term then i like these item rpgs btw

1k6dykw,gaming,2025-04-23 23:41:37,i am glad they made sure not to remove this classic piece of literature in the oblivion remake 
1k6d2oi,gaming,2025-04-23 23:00:36,the nintendo gamekey cards is a manipulation tactic let me explain the gamekey cards exists because nintendo only made gb cards where games can be put in but some cheap developers didnt want to spend extra money putting their gb game or gb game into a gb card so they opted for gamekey cards which is basically a cartridge with a download code there is no game inside the cartridge the only people that should be forced to use gamekey cards are games with huge data file sizes like over gb games like gta v for example _fyi the original switch had cards ranging from gb to gb_ when you insert the gamekey card the game will be downloaded from the eshop but instead of taking up storage in your card it takes up storage in your systemsd card why because the gamekey cards dont have room to store game data it only has code put in it to download the game when inserted in the switch from eshop and sync the downloaded game with the cartridge data so you can play it _even though its a digital download you cant play it without the card inserted so its inferior to digital download and true physical games_ another worse news about the gamekey cards is that once the swich is discontinued or and the eshopservers are shut down you wont be able to download games on different switch consoles because the eshop is closed you cant sell it or let people borrow it because there is no game to download so basically you have a gamekey card that only works on your switch _unless you deleted your digital download to save storage space or something_ but wont work on unused switch consoles over time people will realize over time that gamekey cards are way inferior to digital games and thats when they will start opting for digital games just for convenience and thats how the alldigital future begins which is exactly what nintendo wants so they could save what little costs they have with manufacturing and distributing the physical games concluson to my point an all digital future is very bad for gaming you dont own digital games developers can take it away anytime you no longer have any power over what you paid for with your own money this is serious and we need to take it seriously btw every first party nintendo game will be in the catridge completely like mario kart world

1k602ee,gaming,2025-04-23 14:07:14,does anyone else find the idea of sandbox games more exciting than actually playing them i found myself wanting to play some kind of sandbox game that involved building or managing a kingdom in some way and after a lot of googling and faffing around i came across a game called saelig which is essentially medieval kenshi a sandbox medieval life simulator in essence where you start your life as whatever you want to be and do whatever the hell you want but what ive found is that i apparently lack imagination i boot it up with grand intentions of giving my character this backstory and personality traits with certain ambitions but then i end up just sort of doing nothing i dunno what it is maybe its a matter of immersion that gets easily shattered by clunky controls and mechanics usually present in these games or perhaps its a time thing as a working adult i dont have the time to fully indulge myself in these games even when i have the time you never know when something will come up that needs to be done i also think perhaps that i expect too much from these games i think i want the world to feel more alive and react to my character and itself more than current games allows so that they cant be gamed in a sense because after a while you figure the mechanics out and theres no real surprise or intrigue left it just becomes do this to be able to do this so i can do this etc anyone else have a similar experience

1k5xzvg,gaming,2025-04-23 12:32:36,oblivion remastered reminds me why i fell in love with games no handholding just pure discovery a quick whine against product management let me preface im actually kind of active on that stopgaming subreddit i hate the data mining that goes into building retention systems ive generally disliked the whole concept of implementing modern product management into games for a very long time the way games try to manipulate you into logging in every day just to tick boxes but when i play oblivion i feel rewarded and immersed in all the right ways its like when i sit down to read the discworld series which ive been really getting into lately i feel like i can step away at any time its a world i can put my mind into and explore not because i have to but because i want to theres no quest grinding or gear treadmill forcing me forward its more like type fun you spend hours doing practically nothing wandering being forced to really soak in the views and atmosphere or simply the writing and then bam something fantastical occurs so playing the oblivion remaster feels like stepping into a time machine back when games didnt shove quest markers in your face or funnel you down a glowing breadcrumb trail it doesnt tell you what to do and more importantly it doesnt tell you how to do it you overhear a rumor read a strange note or wander into a forgotten ruin and thats your cue to explore not because the game told you to but because you wanted to theres no automove no compass babysitting you just your own curiosity and the freedom to make mistakes get lost and stumble onto something incredible that feeling of genuine adventure of you the player peeling back a world layer by layer is something modern games have largely forgotten oblivion remembers edit seems theres a good chance ive just not been playing the right kind of games reading the comments thanks for the recommendations keep em coming

1k4q0av,gaming,2025-04-21 22:02:43,what are some games that would be better without experience and level systems excluding battle passes account levels and other player retention bs rpg style levelup systems often get alot of praise for being a really easy way to add a sense of progression to a game but i think theres plenty of times where they actively hinder the experience and it be better without them again this is not referring to battle passes or account levels that just artificially board you from content so youre forced to grind this stuff is done for player retention metrics so theyre tacked on because of corporate reasoning i want to hear games where the devs put in levels so you can unlock new skills or raise your stats but it wouldve been better if those levels werent there at all for example in street fighter s world tour mode your created character having a level actually makes it harder to gather dyes from random enemies since they often require you hitting them with certain attacks and they can easily die before you reach the goal needed to get the item you need another example is sonic and the secret rings which has an exp and level system where you can equip more abilities as you complete levels however every ability is either useless should be standard or in some rare cases actually hinder your ability to control sonic primarily with homing attack lockon range during enemy hunt missions and whatevers making me overshoot rails when i try to jump off them
1k4pw6m,gaming,2025-04-21 21:57:53,what are some moments in games that you played when you were a kid that scared you or made you feel weird or disturbed idk why but red in the original pokémon gbc games made me feel a little weird because hes just alone in a cave and doesnt say anything when you battle him like why is even there sax encounters in metroid fusion the game in general is a little disturbing especially in the second half but man those sax encounters freaked me out sometimes metroid prime on gamecube freaked me out the most especially when fighting the space pirates in the dark as a kid i was too scared to play but eventually beat it when i was a teenager earthbound also on the last level and final boss of the game that last section is really strange and made me feel a little creeped out i wont lie i was getting a little panicked during the ending of the boss fight it was one big wtf moment because it was so unexpected the levels in mario bros with moving platforms and the stage is constantly pushing you forward i hated those levels because it made me feel uneasy haha
1k4or57,gaming,2025-04-21 21:09:57,sonic as a metroidvania the perfect game formula for a new direction in the series hear me out a reimagining of a d sonic game think of a world in the vein of games like ori and the blind forest hollow knight et al incredible d visuals with the upgrade gameplay formula of super metroid you play as sonic youre dropped into a mysterious new island you have a huge d open world to explore you need to gather the chaos emeralds which have been scattered all over with each granting you a new ability the game has different biomes instead of traditional linear levels or zones and acts with a to b gameplay the standard metroidvania gameplay loop is intact allowing certain areas and biomes to be accessed when new abilities are discovered the reason why i think this is perfect the giant open world is perfect for the gimmick speed and traversal exploration something the classic stagezone formula fails to balance correctly due to the constrained limitations of each linear level affecting the flow of the game instead of a b gameplay you must backtrack and explore and familiarize yourself with the world the game world can be perfectly designed for his abilities without the usual annoying hurdles found in linear levels areas can be seamless instead the map can be designed with much more care and attention chaos emeralds are literally the perfect item for collecting in key areas to regain an ability unlock spin dash unlock speed rush unlock homing attack super sonic etc etc a boss can be fought at each emerald location rings can be collected as healing dispersed when defeating basic enemies in the overworld they actually serve some purpose other than a glorified hit shield one of the main problems people have with the older games in a d space is a conflict of objectives they think youre supposed to race to the end as quick as possible since its all about speed just to run into egregiously placed enemy andor spikes and stuff causing for irritating and unclear objectives there is no need for that in an open endtoend world design speed can coexist with exploration much more naturally with the idea of upgrade abilities allowing increased speed and finesse of movement past areas can be blasted through with ease and lower level enemies dispatched as you become stronger again lending a better gameplay feel the sense of speed and abilities of his character something which again is constrained as an idea in the older levelbased approach with poor balance the whole identity of a d sonic game is intact loopdeloops and all it just opens up a whole new design potential and allows better curation for that style of game in the d formula being able to interact with the world and change the world through your actions is huge it cant just be me who feels this the metroidvania genre is practically crying out for a sonic game it almost feels made for it

1k8quk9,Music,2025-04-27 00:01:59,unpopular opinion sabrina carpenter downgraded herself so huge fan first of all been listening to her for years but i think shes severely overrated now one time her music was deep and meaningful and had messages that stayed all day now its just about sex and bad relationship drama and even the tunes although catchy are just bubblegum girly pop that appeals to teenagers and young adults into hookup culture songs she wrote at fifteen are better in terms of lyrics than ones she wrote now i think shes an incredible artist but is trying too hard to appeal to the sexualized stereotypical audience and focuses more on making girls scream over positions and breakups than prioritizing happiness in a relationship and that beautiful tender innocence she once had makes me wonder what happened along the way for her to rebrand so much her music is great its just very mindless upbeat background noise i cook with or go to the beach and listen to now which is great when i just want to shut off my brain a little instead of something i turn on to feel deep emotions and comfort like her older music just my opinion though so any other thoughts welcome

1jwyr9i,movies,2025-04-11 19:46:08,gladiator ii made me finally understand the greatness and uniqueness of russell crowes iconic performance when i was a kid and watched gladiator i obviously thought russell crowe was great as maximus but in the following years i never necessarily understood why he won an oscar for it its not the typical role and performance for which you are considered worthy of an oscar its not a baity biopic about a reallife famous and beloved figure or an arthouse challenging auteurdriven project its an heroic figure in a sandal and sword blockbuster what could be so great about this performance that you even win an oscar for it i didnt get it until recently when i saw on theaters the awaited sequel gladiator ii and paul mescals performance in it and i really like him as an actor made me revalue and understand how hard it is to play convincingly an heroic role like that and how easy and effortless crowe made it look like its an iconic performance that still resonates today but not necessarily for reasons the general public thinks about he managed to do characteractor work immersing himself into this character and creating a threedimensional human being out of this twodimensional role and also imbue it with huge and rugged movie star charisma and such fierce intensity with crowes presence theres such depth and gravitas into a role that on paper could have easily ended up being so flat and dull in the hands of many and many other actors even good ones hes stoic but never dull or uninteresting hes absolutely magnetic always elevating every scene with a ferocious potency its almost a throwback to those powerful big theatrical and commanding performances you would see on those sword and sandal epics of the sss but updated modernized and made accessible for the audiences of the new millennium its a hard feat he pulled off much harder than many people think its simply not a performance you can just imitate and replicate and watching recently mescal trying to inhabit that same type of stoic character made me realize it much more russells performance wasnt just playing the hero or the good soldier there was a personality and specific characterization you cant just copy an entrancingly unique magnetism you cant just hope to recapture on film hes not just great like i always thought but quite frankly no other actor in the world could have played maximus and suddenly turn it into an oscar winning role its an unusual unique and absolutely deserved oscar win and a reminder of crowes unique talents and why he became a full fledged movie star after always having been a great actor i hope one day we will see him again in another role worthy of him and make a great comeback

1jtyamn,movies,2025-04-07 22:32:07,april box office recap a minecraft movie massively overperforms debuting with a colossal million domestically worldwide it earned million the second biggest debut for a video game movie after some very weak months the box office finally picked up steam with april and thats practically all because of a minecraft movie which overcame months of negative buzz to deliver a record opening weekend for a video game adaptation as well as the biggest debut of the year the top earned a combined million this weekend thats up a massive from last year when godzilla x kong the new empire stayed on top while monkey man and the first omen underwhelmed debuting atop wbs a minecraft movie surpassed all expectations earning a colossal million in theaters thats even bigger than wbs barbie million and its only behind harry potter and the deathly hallows part million for the studios biggest debut the opening is also higher than the previous video game record the super mario bros movie million although mario debuted on a wednesday and burned off demand simply put its a fantastic film especially after months of negative buzz surrounding the films trailers and a much needed win for wb after a slate of disappointing performers like joker war of the rohirrim companion and the alto knights back in september when the teaser trailer debuted the film earned poor reception with many criticizing the vfx to win over audiences for the other trailers studio marketing suits added more vfx and quelled rabid fans by conveying that their minecraft will stay true to the game but thats perhaps the key people will talk badly about a product but that buzz translates into awareness which builds into curiosity of course not all negative buzz translates into curiosity snow white waving in the distance but the advantage for this film is simply minecraft despite the belief that the game lost relevance years ago the stats say otherwise minecraft is the bestselling video game of all time with over million copies sold and nearly million monthly active players as of clearly theres already an audience awaiting for a film and they happily paid tickets for this even lukewarm reviews on rt didnt dissuade fans from checking it out according to warner bros of the audience was male and was under years old they gave it a middling b on cinemascore which is very mediocre for a family film while word of mouth among children is very positive adults are less thrilled with the film well see in subsequent weeks how much it drops but for now a million domestic total is in the cards for a minecraft movie last weeks champ a working man added million this weekend thats a drop which is slightly worse than beekeepers drop of course that film had incredibly weak competition but its a sign that the film might not be able to leg out as hoped through days the film has amassed million and it should finish with around million domestically in third place the chosen last supper part earned million this weekend thats down from part s performance last week lets see how part fares this weekend with the arrival of a big blockbuster snow white had another terrible drop this weekend it fell a rough earning just million this weekend the films legs appear to be running out through days the film has earned a terrible million and its gonna finish with less than million domestically thats absolutely pathetic blumhouses the woman in the yard added million this weekend thats a drop which isnt that bad considering the films poor word of mouth through days the film has earned million and it should pass million by next week death of a unicorn earned million this weekend thats a drop which is quite rough for a comedy through days the film has earned just million and it will struggle to get to million by the end of its run with the arrival of part the chosen last supper part collapsed a horrible this weekend earning just million that took its domestic lifetime to million after days there was another wide release this weekend neons hell of a summer debuting in theaters it earned an okay million with weak word of mouth and horrorthriller competition on the way its gonna disappear quickly from theaters in ninth place bleecker streets the friend expanded to theaters and earned million this weekend rounding up the top was captain america brave new world which fell and added million this weekend the films domestic total stands at million and it will crack the million milestone sometime this week overseas a minecraft movie also took over the rest of the world the film earned a huge million overseas for a million worldwide debut thats the second biggest debut for a video game movie behind mario the best debuts were in the uk m china m mexico m germany m and australia m it still has other markets left including japan well see if the film can be strong enough to hit the billion mark snow white is running out of steam and its already its third week it added just million overseas which takes its worldwide total to a terrible million films that ended their run this week none this weekend were getting four wide releases and none stand a chance in dethroning minecraft the first is th century studios the amateur which stars rami malek as a cia cryptographer who seeks revenge against his wifes killers with a working man slowing down this could be a main attraction for oldschool action fans another release is universalblumhouses drop which stars meghann fahy as a widow who is contacted by a stranger to kill her date or her family will be murdered the film already premiered at sxsw and it has received strong reviews on rt can it be the hit that blumhouse wants and needs another is as warfare which follows in realtime a platoon of navy seals on a mission through insurgent territory in its directed by both ray mendoza and alex garland although the latter states his role is more secondary and it has earned great reviews so far on rt its unreasonable to expect numbers similar to civil war but perhaps it could be a surprise breakout for a and finally theres angel studios the king of kings an animated film about the life of jesus christ angel studios has delivered a big marketing for the film and presales are reportedly strong here maybe it could surprise

are made with love sequels spinoffs and bigbudget adaptations often make the artform feel inert because they are produced with so little heart that they might as well have been generated by ai but heres the thing i actually liked a minecraft movie im as surprised as you are this is not a disaster not by a mile in fact for most of its duration its downright charming and in parts had me laughing out loud variety owen glieberman watching a minecraft movie were always aware that the story is something thats been grafted onto the world and that we dont have much of a dramatic stake in it that its just the films way of cobbling together something that works which in its way is very minecraft some of this is amusing but like the rest of a minecraft movie it never feels like it matters yet its no insult to say that in this case thats actually true to the spirit of a video game that turns life into a blockhead version of itself the hollywood reporter lovia gyrakye the most disappointing aspect of a minecraft movie directed by the husbandwife duo who go by jared hess napoleon dynamite nacho libre isnt that its born out of an existing ip we live in a world of loweffort reboots unnecessary remakes and movies operating as extensions of corporate brands another one of these gluttonous projects is hardly surprising what makes a minecraft movie so dispiriting is how it fails to spark the imagination betraying a core tenet of the game on which its based the wrap michael ordona the most accurate summation of a minecraft movie is probably it is what it is its what its supposed to be it probably wont dig up many new converts to the game but should strike boxoffice silver at least and fans be sure to stick around for two credits scenes especially the second one indiewire david ehrlich c its a real credit to blacks irrepressibly unique comic energy that a minecraft movie never feels quite as hypocritical as it should either disastrously illsuited for its message about how money is the enemy of joy or immaculately wellsuited for its message about much harder it is to build things than it is to destroy them hess film cant help but feel like its very existence is an affront to the creative freedom that has allowed minecraft to become such a vital form of selfexploration for kids around the world even warner bros choice to call it a minecraft movie as opposed to the minecraft movie implies a spectrum of different concepts despite the reality of a business that can only imagine this one but black whatever his charms and regardless of how well theyre deployed here is a living testament to the idea that people can still thrive by staying true to their own expression if not in this world then perhaps in one of their own design ign jesse hassenger for a bigstudio adaptation of a massively popular videogame a minecraft movie lets a surprising amount of its directors personality shine through napoleon dynamites jared hess manages to fit some laughoutloud silliness into his overworld saga before surrendering to the obligations of cgdriven fantasy adventure thematically a minecraft movie offers a pat worldiswhatyoumakeit lesson but jack black and jason momoa in particular sell it with a lot of comic enthusiasm av club jacob oller one could rightfully question pretty much all of a minecraft movie a formulaic template ornamented with surrealism some moments bear the scribbled signature of a filmmaker with offbeat passions these are quickly plastered over by the hotel artwork of a fourquadrant ip extravaganzaand even the bythenumbers sequences seem jumbled out of order or repeated yet theres something fitting about this films contradictions minecraft is fertile ground for innovation and exploitation its adaptable limited mostly by those playing it one can build something personal copy something mass produced or attempt to tweak one with the other those behind a minecraft movie saw infinite possibilities laid out before them andunlike another adaptation of a popular building pastime the lego movieopted for the one thats been made a thousand times before new york post johnny oleksinski your noggin will certainly be done in by steve and garrett momoa flying through the air in a risque position suggesting a sex act really a minecraft movie a minute lobotomy put that on the poster for the uninitiated the overworld im pretty sure is a pixelated place where a player can erect buildings create tools and design weapons out of blocks the rules are unclear as the filmmakers picked silliness over storytelling stacking cubes would not at first glance seem like a strong plot to hang an actionadventure film on however the lego movie did so with cleverness heart and humor trust me the lego movie is lawrence of arabia next to minecraft next best picture giovanni lago theres a world where a minecraft movie actually backs the idealism of creativity which it so proudly boasts in its barebones story maybe if the film were animated it couldve played far better to the concept of endless possibilities and allowed for a far more visually dazzling spectacle inherently maybe it would never even be possible as the idea of creativity can only be celebrated as little as possible when its given the parameters of being in such a lazy ip scrape of the barrel as this there used to be a time when a majority of childrens films were made with such care and intention now it seems all you need is buzzwords celebrities and avengers endgame clapinducing moments all of which a minecraft movie has unlike a soul which at least the game feels like it possesses the daily beast nick schager so sloppy is a minecraft movie that it cant keep track of its various concerns highlighted by a mirthless subplotin which jennifer coolidges vice principal picks up and woos an overworld resident whos traveled to our universethat it basically drops around the midway point buried deep within hess wannabe blockbuster is a message about how creativity is cool and thus so too are outcasts yet nothing about this hodgepodge fits together minecraft enthusiasts will be pleased by the films various nods to its multiplatform predecessor nonetheless shouting out isnt the same thing as faithfully celebrating and translating and those with no experience assembling towers villages and weapons in mojang

1k4o61c,movies,2025-04-21 20:45:46,april box office recap sinners opens with a fantastic million domestically making it the best opening for a liveaction original film in years meanwhile a minecraft movie crosses million worldwide on easter weekend audiences decided to go watch sinners the result a debut and the biggest debut for an original film in the postcovid era while a minecraft movie had to cede the top spot its already over million worldwide the top earned a combined million this weekend thats up a massive from last year when civil war held the top spot from disappointing newcomers like abigail and the ministry of ungentlemanly warfare debuting atop ryan cooglers sinners earned a fantastic million in theaters this is the best debut for cooglers career outside the black panther films in fact its the biggest debut for a liveaction original film in the postcovid climate opening above nope million simply put its a fantastic start take into account getting an original film to open this high is a miracle given that audiences are pivoting to focusing on franchises its a testament to the strength of ryan coogler and michael b jordan so how they did succeed where other original films failed for the past decade coogler has earned some great good will thanks to his works in films like creed and black panther the films have earned fantastic reception allowing him to finally get an original title like sinners to get greenlit it wasnt easy obviously a big reason why some studios turned it down was cooglers request to have the film rights revert to him after years so warner bros took the bullet and agreed to his terms a decision that apparently scared a lot of hollywood executives the films clear selling point was coogler and jordan but the premise was also very important a s horror film with jordan playing twins has been very weak for horror the biggest horror film is the monkey which hasnt even topped million worldwide the audience was starving for a horror film and sinners arrived at the right time to offer just that the films fantastic reviews cannot be ignored either its sitting at a marvelous on rotten tomatoes and on metacritic that makes it one of the best films of the year so even nonhorror fans wanted to see if the film would live up to the hype according to warner bros the biggest demos were black caucasians hispanic and latino and asian they gave it an incredible a on cinemascore this makes it one of the few horror films to get an a on the site poltergeist and aliens are the other two in its yearold history yes its insanely hard for a horror film to get this grade what does this mean that the film is gonna have some damn great legs its already seen in the weekend horror films can drop over on sunday yet sinners dropped just with no horror competition till final destination bloodlines sinners can have a lot of space for now were predicting a million domestic total for the film which is simply fantastic all around a minecraft movie dropped this weekend grossing million thats not a bad drop but its still rough just like last weeks the film is not collapsing but its not showing great legs either the film has amassed million so far and it should still hit over million domestically unsurprisingly the king of kings benefitted from the easter weekend it dipped just earning million this weekend thats one of the best holds for a film playing at over theaters through days the film has earned million although with the holiday over maybe it will have a steep drop next weekend th century studios the amateur was hit by the arrival of sinners it dropped a rough earning million this weekend while the film was aiming an old audience that doesnt go to opening weekend it looks like the film is struggling to leg out through days the film has earned a weak million and it remains a question mark if it will hit million domestically in fifth place as warfare dipped adding million this weekend through days the film has earned million and it will probably end its run with around million domestically universalblumhouses drop added million this weekend which is a poor drop after its already low start despite positive reviews and word of mouth the audience doesnt appear to be interested in the film through days it has earned just million and its now guaranteed to miss million domestically making it one of blumhouses lowest grossing titles colorful stage the movie a miku who cant sing managed to sneak into the seventh spot despite playing in just theaters earning million this weekend focus features rerelease of pride prejudice earned million in theaters that takes its lifetime total to million the chosen last supper part collapsed this weekend earning just million this weekend through all installments the show has made million so far rounding up the top was disneys snow white which is nearing the end of its run it had another brutal drop earning just million this weekend the films domestic total stands at a poor million so far bleecker street released the wedding banquet in theaters although the film earned just that means that the film is gonna make less than what ang lees original made back in million but the real worst performer of the week was briarcliffs animated film sneaks despite playing in theaters the film earned an abysmal this weekend thats one of the worst debuts for a film playing in over theaters expect this to fade quickly ahead of its wide release this week as the legend of ochi debuted in theaters earning thats a pertheater average which is quite low usually buzzy titles like this make k or more lets just hope it can do better when it hits wide release janus films also released david cronenbergs the shrouds in theaters where the film earned alos a low pertheater average it will continue expanding in the coming weeks overseas a minecraft movie earned million overseas taking its worldwide total to million the best markets are the uk m germany m australia m mexico m and china m the billion mark is becoming more and more likely pals sinners earned million in markets taking its worldwide numbers to million the best debuts were in the uk m france m mexico m germany k and australia k an okay start but its pretty clear its gonna lean heavily on the domestic side the amateur added a further million this weekend for a million worldwide total the best markets are the uk m france m mexico m japan m and spain m at the very least it should hit million worldwide thatd be great if it didnt cost million films that ended their run this week movie release date studio domestic opening domestic total worldwide total budget dog man jan universal m dreamworks dog man has ended its run with million domestically and million worldwide definitely a success given it cost just million but something weird about the film are its legs normally animated films leg out to a x multiplier but dog man finished with just a x multiplier making it one of the most frontloaded animated films while the super bowl impacted its second weekend not hitting the million milestone after its debut is kinda disappointing but then again this should be enough if dreamworks wants a new franchise this weekend weve got three wide releases though its unlikely any of them can take the top spot the closest that could challenge the top spot is amazon mgms the accountant which brings back ben affleck jon bernthal cynthia addairobinson and j k simmons in their roles the original film earned million worldwide and has been a huge success in streaming and home media so a sequel was pretty much imminent although the year gap raises concerns that they might have waited too long another release is sonys until dawn an adaptation of the video game director david f sandberg has had success in the horror field and in fairness the movie tries to change things up from the game nevertheless the films premise a time loop involving different killers suggests it pretty much abandoned the games original plot it remains to be seen if the fans will be willing to buy a ticket and as mentioned as the legend of ochi is hitting wide release the limited release numbers were quite underwhelming but perhaps it could surprise when it hits wide release ____________________________________________________________________________________________ if youre

1k5n8x7,Music,2025-04-23 01:29:16,so whats the backstory on the great online prewar music massacre anyway does anyone know caveat not here to start any arguments about opinions on this or that im only asking for actual facts if anyone knows them because i havent found a thing fans of older music were probably aware that up until a few years ago there were a few youtubers and some others with dedicated websites like the swazoo kulak jukebox iykyk who made it their business to upload every old etc they could get their hands on some uploaders had done lot of careful restoration work too some of these collections were ludicrously enormous and were essentially archival with detailed artist information recordingpressing information band members often uncredited on those old recordings and so on it was a great way to introduce new people to prewar ragtime jazz blues swing etc by pointing them to eg ragtimedorianhenry on youtube or a one of the halfdozen similar accounts it seems like at some point a few years ago all these accounts and sites as i said mainly youtube accounts were nuked from orbit while the majority of content on these accounts were publicdomain music not all of it was and its not unreasonable to assume there was maybe a copyright strike or something but at the same time past mass copyright strikes usually were followed by the rightsholders monetizing their archives and ive not yet seen any company putting up large archives of prewar music on youtube or any of the main streaming platforms for any amount of money so what happened anyway is anyone familiar with the details and has any archive appeared to at least partially replace what was missing or are all the magnificent collections of prewar music once again scattered and lost just seems like an enormous loss to music historians and fans of early music to have had such an accessible collection for maybe the first time in years only to lose it all again certainly not what alan lomax had in mind anyway i guess i just want to know why
